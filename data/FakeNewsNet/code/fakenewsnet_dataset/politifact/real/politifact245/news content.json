While at the concert, her father said, she took the drug Ecstasy and then \"wandered the city.\" During her wandering, her father said, she met a young man who took her to his parents' home in Towaco, N.J.\n\nThe young man, whose name was not released, kept her in the home without his parents' knowledge, the police said. Officers went to the home in response to several telephone calls, but the police would not give further details. The Montville police said no charges would be filed.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/13/nyregion/missing-teen-ager-found-in-new-jersey.html", "title": "Missing Teen-Ager Found in New Jersey", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Missing Teen-Ager Found in New Jersey", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1996071300000081051, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Missing Teen-Ager Found in New Jersey", "col": 1996, "pdate": 19960713, "utime": 19960713010000, "ptime": 19960713010000, "DISPLAYDATE": "July 13, 1996", "dat": "July 13, 1996", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "missing-teen-ager-found-in-new-jersey", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "published": "1996-07-13T01:00:00-04:00", "modified": "1996-07-13T01:00:00-04:00", "section": "N.Y. / Region", "section-taxonomy-id": "C4DC8C0C-E148-4201-BF10-82F1C903DBFB", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/section/nyregion", "top-level-section": "nyregion", "tag": "MISSING PERSONS"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/13/nyregion/missing-teen-ager-found-in-new-jersey.html", "type": "article", "title": "Missing Teen-Ager Found in New Jersey", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "twitter": {"site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/13/nyregion/missing-teen-ager-found-in-new-jersey.html", "title": "Missing Teen-Ager Found in New Jersey", "card": "summary"}, "tone": "news", "isFullText": 1, "isShortText": 1, "pdfUrl": "https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/svc/tmach/v1/refer?res=9D00E7DE1E39F930A25754C0A960958260&pdf=true", "resKey": "9D00E7DE1E39F930A25754C0A960958260", "PT": "article", "CG": "nyregion", "SCG": "full-text", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "Late Edition - Final", "geo": "NEW JERSEY", "per": "GAY, MELISSA", "des": "MISSING PERSONS", "keywords": "NEW JERSEY  USA,CONNECTICUT,NEW JERSEY,GAY  MELISSA,CHILDREN AND YOUTH,MISSING PERSONS", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "nyregion", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://query.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
