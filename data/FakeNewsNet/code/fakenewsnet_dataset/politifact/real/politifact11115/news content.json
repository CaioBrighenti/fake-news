Leon of United States District Court, according to a transcript obtained by Politico. The judge said that \u201cfor reasons known only to itself,\u201d the State Department \u201chas been, to say the least, recalcitrant in responding.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, lawmakers on the Republican-led House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks said they planned to summon Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s chief of staff to Capitol Hill to answer questions about why the department has not produced documents that the panel subpoenaed. That hearing is set for next Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe State Department has used every excuse to avoid complying with fundamental requests for documents,\u201d said the chairman of the House committee, Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina.\n\nMr. Gowdy said that while the committee has used an array of measures to try to get the State Department to hand over documents, the results have been the same. \u201cOur committee is not in possession of all documents needed to do the work assigned to us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe State Department has sought to delay the hearing, citing continuing efforts to brief members of Congress on the details of the nuclear accord with Iran. It is not clear why the State Department has struggled with the classification issues and document production. Republicans have said the department is trying to use those processes to protect Mrs. Clinton.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/24/us/24emails/24emails-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/24/us/24emails/24emails-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/24/us/clinton-email/clinton-email-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/24/us/24emails/24emails-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael S.
