This table breaks out Department budget totals by discretionary and mandatory spending. Spending for discretionary programs is decided in the annual appropriations process. In contrast, spending for mandatory programs is usually a function of the authorizing statutes creating the programs, and generally is not affected by appropriations laws. To learn more about discretionary and mandatory spending in the Education Department, please see Budget Process and Calendar .\n\nThese historical tables show State funding under formula-allocated and selected student aid programs administered by the Department. The data on these tables are for information purposes only and do not constitute any binding agreement on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education:\n\nState History Tables by Program Fiscal Year
