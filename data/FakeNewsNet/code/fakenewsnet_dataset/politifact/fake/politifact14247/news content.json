expressed their skepticism that the American Moon landings ever happened, reports the Beijing Daily Express.\n\nMore than 2,000 high-ranking officials of the Chinese Communist Party have signed a petition this week asking explanations from the American government concerning the American Moon landings after doubts arose that the Apollo Moon landings ever happened.\n\nThese allegations have come up after recent analysis of pictures taken from the Chinese Chang\u2019e-4 probe allegedly found no traces of the American Moon landings existing on the Moon.\n\nSeveral high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party even stated publicly that these latest findings proved without a doubt that the Moon landings were an \u201celaborately orchestrated hoax to fool the world about America\u2019s space program capabilities\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s top astrophysicist, Yury Ignatyevich Mukhin, has also made a public statement this week claiming that the Russian government \u201chad always been aware of the situation since the early 1970\u2019s\u201d\n\nThese recent allegations have given credence to conspiracy theorists who have been claiming for decades that America has never gone to the Moon.\n\nConspiracy theorists believe that president Richard Nixon pushed the agenda of a fake Apollo program to fool USSR into the Space Race and eventually, the nuclear arms race, with the purpose of ruining the USSR.\n\nThe Apollo program was the third United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished landing the first humans on the Moon from 1969 to 1972.\n\nNo other country has since landed a human on the Moon, although several countries, such as Russia and China, are expected to plan missions beyond 2030.",
