Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/HillaryClintonRussia1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1155276126-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Joe-Biden-Speech-New-York-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/GettyImages-1140261394-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/Nigel-Farage-6-200x150.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/Trump-Economy-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/lionking1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/AP_19192781689693-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Rose-Garden-Brawl-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Rashida-Tlaib-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-wipes-eyes-testifying-House-Oversight-Committee-detention-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1161241517-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1155253407-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1150972917-200x150.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/12/Donald-Trump-Hands-on-Desk-Andrew-Harnik-Associated-Press-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/belmarsh-200x150.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/GettyImages-1085012486-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/07/Bradford-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/us-coast-guardsmen-jump-onto-homemade-submarine-filled-with-cocaine-200x150.png"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rep.
