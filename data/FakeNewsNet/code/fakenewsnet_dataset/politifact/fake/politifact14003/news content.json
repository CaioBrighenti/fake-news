The process included using an air compressor to put pot smoke into the tank before using a regulator to inhale.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Fitzpatrick invited his buddies over to check out the \u2018Scuba Bong,\u2019 a name that is both inaccurate and sounds much too much like \u2018Scuba Bomb,\u2019 when the accident occurred. While attempting to attach the air compressor to the tank, the victim knocked over the tank causing an explosion that would send shrapnel into his groin, severing his balls clean off.\n\nNone of his friends were injured in the accident.\n\nThe tank in question was fashioned in the early 90\u2019s with a type of aluminum that is known for its capacity to rupture. However, the company that built the tank is unlikely to cover an insurance claim due to the victim\u2019s use of the tank as a smoking device.
