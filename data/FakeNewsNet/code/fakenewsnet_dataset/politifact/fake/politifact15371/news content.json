Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.\n\nRenato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.\u201d \u201cThis is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:\n\nHaving The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.\n\nSaying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.\n\nSigning an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.\n\nFortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GettyImages-673470392.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fs32423.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://washingtonsources.org/trump-votes-for-death-penalty-for-being-gay-5/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fs32423-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://staging.washingtonsources.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/logo-txt-1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/droppedcase.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsffsfsfs1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/logo-txt-1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://washingtonsources.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsffsfsfs1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/voted-219x300.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/breakingnews1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/droppedcase-150x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/17038c11257ff52e1418bc53c5caa8d2?s=74&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508194546im_/http://washingtonsources.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fsffsfsfs1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Trump Votes For Death Penalty For Being Gay", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Trump Votes For Death Penalty For Being Gay", "description": "President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it's hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.
