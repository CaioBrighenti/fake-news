He and other right-wing commentators were following in the footsteps of a tradition dating back to the 1950s and the far-right John Birch Society, which claimed a communist conspiracy was hell-bent on taking \u201cthe Christ out of Christmas,\u201d also blaming \"fantatics\" at the UN for trying to \"poison the 1959 Christmas season with their high-pressure propaganda.\"\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait\u2026 Thank you for signing up.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 9, 2017\n\nEven before entering politics, Trump declared that so-called \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d in the name of inclusivity and separation of church and state had gone too far. In 2011, Trump went as far as to falsely accuse then-President Barack Obama of failing to send Christmas greetings, while remembering to mark the African festival of Kwanzaa.\n\nIn part of his effort to rally evangelical Christians to his camp, Trump made the issue a running theme during his 2016 presidential election campaign, repeatedly promising at his rallies that he would \u201cbring back\u201d the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d\n\nskip - Sarah Huckabee Sanders\n\n>>The Palestinians just gave Netanyahu what he always wanted for Christmas | Analysis\n\nskip - Sanders reaction 1\n\nNo one else find it oddly concerning at WH press conference today Sarah Sanders started with bringing up Christmas as \u201c birth of our savior \u201c.....not all Americans would agree that this was appropriate place to discuss her religion \u2014 Karen Delaney (@KarenDelaney9) December 7, 2017\n\nskip - Sanders reaction 2\n\n@PressSec The stories of giving & of stepping up were inspirational, as you intended.

That I can tell you.\u201d\n\nIn his 2016 post-election victory lap around the country, his travels were officially dubbed the \u201cMerry Christmas USA 2016 Victory Tour.\u201d A year later, at a rally in Pensacola, Florida, \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d was front and center once again.\n\nskip - Daniel Shapiro tweet\n\nLove that Trump\u2019s proclamation on Jerusalem is dated 2017 \u201cin the year of our Lord\u201d.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the daughter of evangelical leader and former Gov. Mike Huckabee, invoked Christian belief during her briefing on December 7, with a tale designed to \u201cshine a spotlight\u201d on seasonal \u201cgenerosity.\u201d She related the story of St. Matthew\u2019s Episcopal Church in Wheeling, West Virginia, which follows a century-old tradition of helping families who can\u2019t afford Christmas toys for their children. While Sanders\u2019 story itself did not contain religious content or exclude non-Christians, the message she attached to it was undeniably sectarian. She said that such \u201cstories are important because they remind us what this season is all about and that\u2019s the greatest gift of all, that a savior was born.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 message raised eyebrows and comment on social media.\n\nskip - Ivanka Trump tweet\n\nAnother small but significant sign of change was spotted by former White House aide and former ambassador to Israel Daniel B. Shapiro, who pointed out that the proclamation declaring Jerusalem to be Israel\u2019s capital signed by Trump had been worded to state that the event was taking place on \u201cthis sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen.\u201d\n\nskip - Ivanka's defiance\n\nTRUMP\u2019s DAUGHTER IS AGAINST CHRISTMAS!!! WHAT WILL FOX NEWS DO?\u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d Ivanka Trump, White House adviser, tweeted earlier this month, adding a kissy-face emoji. She dared do this in a tweet that included a photo of her posing in front of Christmas trees. \u2014 Joan Strong (@TruthInJeopardy) December 23, 2017\n\nShapiro noted on Twitter that during his years in the Obama White House, he had \u201cworked hard (with mixed success) to get that standard formulation out of White House proclamations aimed at the Jewish community.\u201d He was referring to the standard language for presidential proclamations, which explicitly state the number of years since the birth of Jesus Christ, marking the start of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nskip - Eric Trump tweet\n\nBut as the weeks passed and Christmas neared, there wasn\u2019t much to justify concerns that the Trump White House would be transformed into an overtly Christian observance, excluding other religious traditions.\n\nTrue, the Trump Hanukkah party was smaller, more low-key and more partisan than past celebrations in the Bush and Obama White Houses. But the tradition of holding a Hanukkah celebration only began during the second Bush administration, so Trump presumably could have gotten away with eliminating it \u2013 though that might not have sat well with daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nIndeed, Ivanka Trump\u2019s Twitter feed was one of the clearest indicators that the \u201creturn to Merry Christmas\u201d message had not penetrated the culture very deeply.\n\nShe seemed to quite deliberately choose to wish her five million Twitter followers \u201cHappy Holidays!\u201d with no mention of the \u201cC-word,\u201d in what some viewed as outright defiance of her father\u2019s \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d rhetoric.\n\nFor those who would chalk up Ivanka\u2019s Christmas-less greeting to the fact she is Jewish, there was further evidence of the cultural zeitgeist with the fact her younger brother Eric also stayed ecumenical in wishing the best from Trump Winery.\n\nEven Melania Trump\u2019s much publicized \u2013 and much maligned \u2013 choices for decorating the White House felt more pagan than overtly Christian, with many white branches and relatively few representations of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus. Yes, there was a cr\u00e8che display in the White House, but there had been one throughout the Obama administration, despite false rumors to the contrary.\n\nAll of this demonstrates the fact that while Trump\u2019s enthusiastic crusade against what he characterizes as a nefarious anti-\u201cMerry Christmas\u201d and pro-\u201cHappy Holidays\u201d conspiracy may play well with his base, his obsession with the issue isn\u2019t at all reflective of mainstream America.\n\nThat feeling is born out with a newly released Pew Research Center survey, which found that far fewer Americans care about being explicitly wished a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d than they had in the past.\n\nThe Pew poll reported: \u201cA rising share of Americans say they do not have a preference about how they are greeted in stores during the holiday season, while a declining percentage prefer to have stores greet them with \u2018Merry Christmas.\u2019\u201d\n\nskip - Politicization of Christmas\n\nI now no longer know if people wishing me a Merry Christmas want me to have a merry Christmas or fashion themselves aggressive foot soldiers in what they perceive to be the War on Christmas. \u2014 Keith Phipps (@kphipps3000) December 23, 2017\n\nAccording to the survey, Americans were previously split down the middle when it came to expressing a preference for \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d over an alternative greeting when they were asked about it more than a decade ago and again in 2012.\n\nskip - Feraz Ozel tweet\n\n\u2018My Muslim family has been happy to say Merry Christmas\u2019 \u2014 Comedian Feraz Ozel is proving once and for all that the \u2018War on Christmas\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually exist pic.twitter.com/Se6dEVvQxJ \u2014 NowThis (@nowthisnews) December 22, 2017\n\nThis year, more than half of the U.S. public surveyed, 52 percent, told pollsters that a business\u2019 choice of holiday greeting did not matter to them, while just a third \u2013 32 percent \u2013 said they preferred that stores and businesses greet customers with \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d during the holidays.\n\nOverall, the Pew survey pointed to the fact that Trump\u2019s election does not reflect a surge in Christian religiosity in America. In fact, it found the religious aspects of Christmas were markedly \u201cdeclining.\u201d\n\nThe number of Americans who believe that the \u201cbiblical account of the birth of Jesus depicts actual events\u201d is \u201cshrinking,\u201d it said, and \u201ca declining majority says religious displays such as nativity scenes should be allowed on government property.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new for Trump to appeal to his core base, and presumably his \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d obsession shores up his status with evangelicals \u2013 even as it flies in the face of the sentiments of the majority of Americans, who seem happy to celebrate any holiday and don\u2019t care much how it\u2019s expressed. For many, the politicization of what is supposed to be a greeting of seasonal cheer is simply confusing.\n\nIn a blow to the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d theory from one of Trump\u2019s least favorite religious minorities, comedian Feraz Ozel compiled video of Muslim-American families wishing their countrymen a Merry Christmas in order to demonstrate that non-Christians were just fine with the phrase.\n\n\u201cPlenty of Muslims and brown folks from different religions are still happy to wish you a \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 if the time is right,\u201d Ozel said. \u201cJust because some people say \u2018Happy Holidays\u2019 to people who don\u2019t celebrate it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not happy to wish you a very Merry Christmas also.\u201d", "images":
