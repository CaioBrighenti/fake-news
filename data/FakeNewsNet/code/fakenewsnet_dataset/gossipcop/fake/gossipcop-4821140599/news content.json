But the actress may be finally dropping some hints as to what's going on in her relationship with rumored boyfriend Jamie Foxx . This week she was spotted wearing what looked like a gold wedding band on that very important finger. So obviously we had to investigate if Holmes and Foxx decided to make it official.\n\nAccording to HollywoodLife.com Holmes' rumored beau Foxx has also been spotted sporting a diamond and gold band on his left ring finger. Which is a little bit suspicious if you ask us. Considering the pair has been spotted together since 2013 and has yet to even confirm their dating we aren't totally surprised they're keeping quiet on their potentially new husband and wife status.\n\nSee More: The Best Celebrity Engagement Rings\n\nThe most recent rumors that these two were making it official started in early January when Holmes stepped on the red carpet with a gorgeous diamond ring on her engagement finger. At first we thought maybe Holmes was just making a bold fashion choice. Plenty of celebs are doing it lately (ahem Kate Mara and Kylie Jenner ) but none of those stars are later spotted rocking what looks like a wedding band.\n\n\"They've [Foxx and Holmes] discussed eloping or having a small, quiet wedding in an out-of-the-way place,\" InTouch Weekly reported in January when Holmes debuted her speculated engagement ring.\n\nJanuary isn't the first time these two stirred up rumors. Back in July Holmes was spotted wearing a different gold band on that finger while walking in NYC. Hmmm, seeing Holmes and Foxx sporting gold rings on their ring fingers have us seriously curious about what's going on with this A-list pairing. While we wait for them to confirm their nuptials we'll be over here daydreaming about how gorgeous the two must have looked standing up at the alter together.\n\nUPDATE: Holmes's reps have confirmed Holmes and Foxx are NOT married. We can still hope, right?", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5d179c696bc0270009e7347e/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1141025208.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5d10e4a71b716f49824edfc5/1:1/w_125/meghan-markle-pink-dress.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e6217f3800bdd3118c4ff/1:1/w_767/blogs-aisle-say-jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-married.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5d25d7b13a2a5c0008a7b3f3/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1156607822.jpg", "http://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e6217f3800bdd3118c4ff/master/pass/blogs-aisle-say-jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-married.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e6217f3800bdd3118c4ff/master/pass/blogs-aisle-say-jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-married.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/katie-holmes-wedding-ring-jamie-foxx", "title": "Is Katie Holmes Married to Jamie Foxx?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The couple has been spotted wearing gold bands lately leaving us dying to know what's going on.", "og": {"description": "The couple has been spotted wearing gold bands lately leaving us dying to know what's going on.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e6217f3800bdd3118c4ff/master/pass/blogs-aisle-say-jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-married.jpg", "title": "Is Katie Holmes Married to Jamie Foxx?", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/katie-holmes-wedding-ring-jamie-foxx", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The couple has been spotted wearing gold bands lately leaving us dying to know what's going on.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e6217f3800bdd3118c4ff/master/pass/blogs-aisle-say-jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-married.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Is Katie Holmes Married to Jamie Foxx?", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/katie-holmes-wedding-ring-jamie-foxx", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "Celebrity Weddings,News", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,Celebrity Weddings,News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
