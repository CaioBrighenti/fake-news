In a new interview, however, former 1D member Malik admits that while he\u2019s mostly on good terms with his former bandmates (fights and all), he\u2019s not in contact with Harry Styles. According to him, they \u201cnever really spoke\u201d \u2014 even when in the band.\n\nSpeaking with Us Weekly after hosting the outlet\u2019s Most Stylish New Yorkers party, Malik said, \u201cTo be honest, I never really spoke to Harry even when I was in the band. So I didn\u2019t really expect that much of a relationship with him when I left. And I haven\u2019t [had one] to be honest.\u201d Ouch!\n\nStill, the \u201cDusk \u2018Till Dawn\u201d singer, who has moved forward with his own solo career post-1D, isn\u2019t ruling out all hope of a group reunion.\n\n\u201cWho knows? I\u2019ve said it before: Never say never,\u201d he told Us Weekly. \u201cIf I wanted to come back in 10, 15 years\u2019 time, then yeah, why not? I don\u2019t know. If I didn\u2019t want to [be in the band] then, I might not. It just depends on how I\u2019m feeling at that time.\u201d\n\nFor now, Malik is enjoying the slower pace of his life. \u201cWe were basically going at, like, 500 miles per hour. We did everything to an extreme in the band,\u201d he recalled. \u201c[Now] it\u2019s not as full on, it\u2019s not as extreme, it\u2019s not as in-your-face. It\u2019s at my own pace. So this way, it feels 100 times more manageable. It\u2019s just easier. It\u2019s a lot less work.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also more to his personal tastes, which run the gamut of musical genres. \u201cI don\u2019t really like to stick to one genre and go off of that. I like to do whatever I\u2019m feeling that day, whatever\u2019s feeling good,\u201d the 24-year-old explained. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of soulful R&B tunes on there, there\u2019s some club tunes on there, there\u2019s some more obvious pop songs as well.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think about Zayn\u2019s 1D admission?
