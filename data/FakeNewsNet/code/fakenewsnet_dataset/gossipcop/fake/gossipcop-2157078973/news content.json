News reports.\n\n\"By the way, we love Jennifer and we noticed she had a ring on. We saw it in the picture. It's so beautiful,\" Kotb asked as photos from Lopez's 49th birthday celebration displayed on the screen. \"I wonder if Alex got that for her for her birthday. Then we're like, what finger is that on? Now we're wondering, what is going on here?\"\n\nThe pair has been fighting off engagement rumors for months, after the singer had been photographed multiple times with a diamond ring on her left ring finger. So, yes, what's really going on here?\n\n\"I did give her that ring . I gave her that ring probably about four or five months ago,\" the baseball player revealed. \"So I got her that ring. She loved it and look how beautiful she looks.\"\n\nBut as for whether or not \"that\" ring is really that ring, the answer appears to be a resounding no.\n\n\"Of course, it has a significance,\" Rodriguez confessed. \"[But] no, we're not engaged. We're not engaged.\"\n\nThough there aren't any sort of wedding bells in the A-list couple's near future, that doesn't mean that things aren't going well\u2014a fact that Rodriguez attributes to his own maturity.\n\n\"To be honest, if this happened when we were in our 20s , it would have never happened. It was just too much craziness. I wasn't mature enough,\" he said. Then, addressing the audience, he noted, \"Boys, we've got to get our dumbness out of the way.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're in our 40s. We're both from New York. We both come from Latino backgrounds. Both have two kids. We've both been through a lot and can really appreciate each other for the good and the challenges.\"\n\nSee more: Watch A-Rod Tell the Adorable Story of How He and J.
