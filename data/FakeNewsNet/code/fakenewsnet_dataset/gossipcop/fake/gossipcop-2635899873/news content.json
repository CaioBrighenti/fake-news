Sources exclusively told In Touch that the longtime pals are no longer close because Matt isn't too fond of Ben's girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus. \"[Matt] thinks she is controlling and manipulative,\" the insider claimed.\n\nAside from her less redeeming qualities, Matt also believes Lindsay is \"bad news\" for Ben. \"She likes to drink and Ben [who recently went to rehab] shouldn't be around that,\" the source said.\n\nAlthough it's unclear when Ben and Lindsay actually started seeing each other, a source told Entertainment Tonight that things got romantic after his separation from wife, Jennifer Garner. Since then, the pair have taken their relationship public as they've been spotted going on dinner dates and grabbing coffee. Rumors even swirled that Ben introduced Lindsay to his three kids \u2014 Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.\n\nBut as close as Lindsay and Ben are getting, Matt still isn't convinced she's the right girl for him. \"Matt doesn\u2019t think she measures up to Jennifer [Garner],\" the source revealed. \"Matt's bummed. He hopes Ben eventually comes to his senses.\"\n\nBen and Matt \u2014 whose careers both kicked off after their roles in Good Will Hunting \u2014 have been friends for more than two decades, so it's safe to say they know each other pretty well. Matt even stuck up for Ben when he was asked about the dad of three's insanely large back tattoo. \"It\u2019s not one man\u2019s job to tell another man what he can do to his back,\" Matt told The Daily Show With Trevor Noah. \"I support him in all of his artistic expression.\"\n\nBut Lindsay is no artistic expression, and Matt \"can't stand\" her. Only time will tell if these friends with so much history can make it work despite the bad blood.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Melissa-McCarthy-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2656px%2C1502px&resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-matt-damon-friends.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/David-Dobrik-Tana-Mongeau-Jake-Paul-Engaged.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/khloe-jordyn-combine.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-matt-damon-pic.png?w=1180#038;h=628&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-matt-damon-friends.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Celebrities-With-Freckles-Feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3264px%2C1846px&resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-lindsay-shookus-relationship.png?w=1180#038;h=757&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-matt-damon-friends.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Riccardi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/matt-damon-ben-affleck-girlfriend-158910/", "title": "Matt Damon Doesn't Like Ben Affleck's Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Are Matt Damon and Ben Affleck letting a woman come between them?
