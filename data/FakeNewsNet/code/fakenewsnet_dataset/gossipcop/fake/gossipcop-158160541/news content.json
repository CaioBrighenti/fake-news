The trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. \"It was Keith\u2019s idea to visit the boot camp,\" says the insider. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. \"He gave her an ultimatum.\"\n\nBut in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. \"They addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,\" the insider explains.\n\nFor more on Nicole and Keith, pick up the latest issue of In Touch magazine, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-emergency-retreat-blast.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-emergency-retreat-blast.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-blast.png?w=1180#038;h=517&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Matt-Lauer-Divorce.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Deonna-Learns-About-Gregs-Ex-on-Married-at-First-Sight.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/realronniemagro_65234596_201850050805475_1976547706221271105_n.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Miranda-Brendan-Happy.jpg?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-emergency-retreat-blast.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Weekly"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-counseling-retreat-155983/", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Went to Retreat to Save Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "In Touch has learned that Nicole Kidman and husband of nearly 12 years Keith Urban, had a five-day visit to Marriage Quest, a private counseling retreat located in Cabot, Vt. \"Nicole and Keith\u2026", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Went to Retreat to Save Marriage", "description": "In Touch has learned that Nicole Kidman and husband of nearly 12 years Keith Urban, had a five-day visit to Marriage Quest, a private counseling retreat located in Cabot, Vt. \"Nicole and Keith\u2026", "url": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-counseling-retreat-155983/", "site_name": "In Touch Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-03T14:58:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-emergency-retreat-blast.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "secure_url": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-emergency-retreat-blast.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"tag": "Nicole Kidman", "published_time": "2018-03-14T12:00:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-03T14:58:43+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 437388016401044, "admins": 593583017, "pages": 75932763901}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In Touch has learned that Nicole Kidman and husband of nearly 12 years Keith Urban, had a five-day visit to Marriage Quest, a private counseling retreat located in Cabot, Vt. \"Nicole and Keith\u2026", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Went to Retreat to Save Marriage", "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-emergency-retreat-blast.jpg?resize=750%2C421"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521028818.0, "source": "http://www.intouchweekly.com", "summary": ""}
