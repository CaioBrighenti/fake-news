Is it rumored fling Selena Gomez? Find out, right here!\n\nSomeone\u2019s not sick of that same old love! Orlando Bloom, 40, has allegedly been pursuing his one-time alleged fling Selena Gomez, 24, according to a source who spoke to Star magazine. After breaking up with girlfriend Katy Perry, 32, at the end of February 2017, Orlando isn\u2019t wasting any time being single; he\u2019s apparently determined to get Selena!\n\n\u201cOrlando began blowing up Selena\u2019s phone the day he and Katy broke up,\u201d the friend told Star magazine. \u201cOrlando doesn\u2019t take Selena\u2019s relationship with The Weeknd seriously. If anything, that makes it more of a challenge.\u201d\n\nWow! That\u2019s incredibly bold of him! Though she\u2019s had some fun times in the past with Orlando, Selena is head over heels in love with The Weekend; she definitely wouldn\u2019t appreciate that line of thinking! In fact, the couple are practically inseparable, a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Selena joined her beau in Europe for a fun romp between tour dates, and then cheered him on at a few concerts. When she headed back to the US, being apart \u201cfeels like agony,\u201d the source said!\n\nThey\u2019re so into each other that they\u2019ve worked on new music together while they were in Europe. At least one of those songs is a majorly sexy love song, a separate source told us EXCLUSIVELY! Back home, Selena shared that she was in the studio, hopefully writing more songs about her dude. As far as we know, there\u2019s nothing in the works about Orlando!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Selena should stay with The Weeknd, or go back to Orlando? tell us in the comments!", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/samantha_wilson.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cereals.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F03%2F15%2Forlando-bloom-calling-selena-gomez-breakup-katy-perry%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2507614&comment_count=35", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/selena-gomez-orlando-bloom-ftr.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-8.29.11-AM.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stephanie-niznik-dead-everwood-nina.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Best-Outdoor-Speakers.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kenya-moore-excited-to-be-returning-to-rhoa-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ed-sheeren-eminem-50-cent-collab-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/evan-and-carly-3-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/cardi-b-fashion-2019.jpg?resize=230%2C135"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/selena-gomez-orlando-bloom-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Wilson", "Political News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/03/15/orlando-bloom-calling-selena-gomez-breakup-katy-perry/", "title": "Selena Gomez & Orlando Bloom: Is He Chasing Her After Split From Katy Perry?", "meta_data": {"description": "Orlando Bloom's single and ready to mingle after splitting from Katy Perry, and he has his sights set on one lady in particular, according to a new report.
