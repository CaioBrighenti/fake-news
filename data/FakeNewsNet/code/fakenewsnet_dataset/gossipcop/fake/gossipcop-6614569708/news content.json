Matt Lauer is losing more people close to him following his sexual harassment allegations. According to Radar, the former Today show host is friendless after his old Long Island pals disowned once news of his allegations and subsequent firing broke. Famous pals like rock icon Billy Joel and radio host Howard Stern are cutting all ties to the disgraced anchor.\n\n\u201cThese guys don\u2019t exactly have the best track records in their own married lives, and they also have their careers to protect,\u201d a source tells Radar. \u201cWhenever they had get-togethers, Matt would never show up with Annette, and the other wives don\u2019t want their guys anywhere near him.\u201d\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nJoel, 68, got married for a fourth time to equestrian Alexis Roderick, 36. While Howard, 64, left his first wife to marry model and actress Beth Ostrosky, 45. Both men admittedly don\u2019t have the best track record when it comes to marriage and they\u2019re not willing to rick their current relationships by being associated with the 60-year-old.\n\nNot only was Matt fired after NBC caught wind of his long history of sexual harassment, he\u2019s also been accused of having multiple affairs during his 19-year-long marriage to Annette. \u201cSeeing her family and friends convinced her she was better off without him,\u201d a source exclusively told In Touch, who noted that years of Matt\u2019s infidelity and humiliation had finally taken their toll. \u201cAfter all she\u2019s been through, the nights of crying herself to sleep and trying to divorce him years ago, it was still one of the hardest things she\u2019s ever done.\u201d\n\nAccording to his neighbors, he isn\u2019t doing well following the scandal. \u201cHe just looks very, very sad,\u201d an employee at a local store exclusively told In Touch. \u201cHe used to be so friendly and chatty, just like he was on TV. Now he keeps his head down. You can tell he\u2019s not really in the best place.\u201d Another neighbor agreed that he has visibly changed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he did when he was on TV,\u201d this Hamptons resident revealed. \u201cHe\u2019s skinny\u2026 It looks like he\u2019s aged 10 years.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-lauer-howard-stern.jpg?w=1180#038;h=600&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Matt-Lauer-Divorce.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/matt-lauer-annette.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-lauer.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-876842764-1.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-lauer.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/matt-lauer.png?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-lauer.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paulina Jayne Isaac"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/matt-lauer-friends-disown-156502/", "title": "Matt Lauer's Friends Have Reportedly Disowned Him Following Sex Scandal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Friends, forever?
