Then, after the pair presented together at the Golden Globe Awards, reports surfaced that the two went public with their relationship. But, fans will be disappointed to find out that there is no truth to the story, and the claims that Pattinson and Watson are dating are completely false.\n\nThe problem is, celebrities don\u2019t choose who they present with at an awards show. So, the fact that Pattinson and Watson shared a few minutes on stage together in no way means the two are in a relationship. The pair presented the award for Best TV Movie or Limited Series, which went to HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies.\n\nNow, there is a new twist to the rumor, with another publication telling a tall tale about Pattinson propositioning Watson for a one-night stand.\n\n#RobertPattinson opens up: \"This Halloween I walked into the most extreme, ah, fancy dress party. I was absolutely normcore and it was the most humiliating experience of my life.\" https://t.co/KWcnK4pU3w \u2014 W magazine (@wmag) January 19, 2018\n\nThe false story, which appeared in Star magazine, alleged that Pattinson has had a crush on Watson since they starred together in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire back in 2005. It then went on to claim that Pattinson used a terrible pick-up line by asking her, \u201cDo you want to hang out at my house, you know, like overnight?\u201d\n\nThe so-called eyewitness then says that, since Watson isn\u2019t a one-night stand type of girl, she made a face like she had eaten some rotten food and ran away.\n\nBut, the incident simply never happened. Reps for both Watson and Pattinson say that the two actors had fun at the awards ceremony, but he didn\u2019t hit on her and she didn\u2019t reject him.\n\nToday at the @womensmarch LA I was carrying this sign and all of a sudden I look over and see EMMA WATSON staring at me from 3ft away. She waved, motioned that she loved my sign, and then I cried. I will NEVER be this cool again guys \u2728? pic.twitter.com/RAzM6WZVr8 \u2014 Molly Pasquarella (@Molly_Pasqui) January 21, 2018\n\nOnce Watson split from her boyfriend, entrepreneur William \u201cMack\u201d Knight, back in November, meaning both she and Pattinson were single, tabloids started to randomly tie the two together just three weeks later. Once one outlet fabricated the romantic connection, others picked it up and copied the story. But, it is all complete fiction.\n\nWatson and Pattinson have not been secretly texting or meeting up in London and Los Angeles. They are simply friends and nothing more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that rumors have spread about the former co-stars. Back in 2009, the same story flew around Hollywood, but Emma Watson shut it down by saying that Robert Pattinson is just a good friend and a super-nice guy, adding he is great to work with.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anna-collins-instagram-300x209.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Gisele-300x223.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RHOBH-Star-Camille-Grammars-Fiances-Shade-Past-Revealed-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ben-affleck-is-all-smiles-amid-he-has-been-out-as-batman-since-2017-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/robert-pattinson-and-suki-waterhouse-just-went-on-a-double-date-with-one-of-the-most-famous-people-in-the-world-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jennifer-aniston-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-Truth-Behind-Those-Robert-Pattinson-And-Emma-Watson-One-Night-Stand-Rumors.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beyonce-1-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-Truth-Behind-Those-Robert-Pattinson-And-Emma-Watson-One-Night-Stand-Rumors.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Audra Bradley", "Grandma R", "Polly Styrene"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/the-truth-behind-those-robert-pattinson-and-emma-watson-one-night-stand-rumors-107354/", "title": "The Truth Behind Those Robert Pattinson And Emma Watson One Night Stand Rumors", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "emma watson, FKA twigs, robert pattinson,", "keywords": "celebrity news, emma watson, FKA twigs, robert pattinson,", "description": "Multiple tabloids have been reporting that there is something going on between Robert Pattinson and Emma Watson, leading fans to believe that there", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The Truth Behind Those Robert Pattinson And Emma Watson One Night Stand Rumors", "description": "Multiple tabloids have been reporting that there is something going on between Robert Pattinson and Emma Watson, leading fans to believe that there", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/the-truth-behind-those-robert-pattinson-and-emma-watson-one-night-stand-rumors-107354/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/The-Truth-Behind-Those-Robert-Pattinson-And-Emma-Watson-One-Night-Stand-Rumors.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-21", "modified_time": "2018-01-21", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/suzykerr/", "section": "Hollywood", "tag": "robert pattinson"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516510800.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
