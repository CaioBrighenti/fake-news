He was released from custody on Tuesday while police continued their investigation.\n\nREAD MORE: Man arrested for trespassing at Taylor Swift\u2019s mansion\n\nPolice obtained a temporary restraining order preventing Sandrock from possessing guns.\n\nAccording to the document, Sandrock was wearing a mask and rubber gloves when he was taken into custody. He told police he had driven from his home in Broomfield, Colo., to see Swift.\n\nHe told the officers he owned three handguns and was on probation in Colorado for firing one, police said.\n\nREAD MORE: YouTube hack hits popular music videos, deletes \u2018Despacito\u2019 video with over 5 billion views\n\nA search of his car turned up a knife, rope, ammunition and more masks and gloves, according to the restraining order.\n\nAccording to the document, prescription medications, including oxycodone, were also found, and Sandrock told the arresting officers that he had depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and manic episodes.\n\nThe arrest followed the April 8 arrest of a homeless man on suspicion of trespassing after he tried to climb a wall at the same property and ignored warnings by security guards to leave the area. Swift was not at home.\n\nJustin Lilly, 23, was charged with a misdemeanour and sentenced to three days in jail.\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift threatens legal action against blogger who compared her to Hitler, ACLU responds\n\nAnother man who violated a restraining order and threatened to kill Swift was sentenced to 10 years probation in early April.\n\nFrank Andrew Hoover was first arrested in November 2016 after violating his restraining order when he followed Swift after her concert at a Formula 1 race.\n\nSwift\u2019s family also claims that Hoover had been sending aggressive emails to Swift\u2019s father from August to Oct. 27 in 2016.\n\nIn these emails uncovered by police, Hoover allegedly refers to the Swifts as the \u201cevil family of devils,\u201d telling them to \u201cenjoy the brain aneurysms and death.\u201d\n\nHoover will be monitored by GPS surveillance for at least a year and has been ordered to keep at least a mile (about 1.6 km) from Swift and her family. Other requirements include psychological testing, substance abuse classes, surrendering of firearms and random drug testing. If he violates these terms, he faces jail time.\n\n\u2014With files from the Associated Press", "images": ["https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/chy102175254_high.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_8137-1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=55&h=55&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/social-impulse/large/twitter/national.gif", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/464/306/Paul_live_848x480_723113028000.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-464099294.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=282", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rcmp-pelican-narrows-youth-arrest.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=150", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/images/gnlive-ads/default.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/markle-archie.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005670&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/211/991/CAPTAIN_COOK_WEB_848x480_1568960579901.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/9572838.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_5882-e1562605151708.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/ad-choices.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/kroeker.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/747/627/kiss_848x480_1569523779519.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/trudeau-trans-mountain.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/19617757-e1535073439213.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stock-floor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/trudeau-trans-mountain.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/trudeau-trans-mountain.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/markle-archie.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/227/30/AIR_CANADA_TURBULENCE_FOLO_(SAM)-ONLINE_848x480_1570048579641.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-464099294.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/raw_3gr0_botanical_sexism_1.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/markle-archie.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/logos/news_2x.png", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/36/615/2019-07-12T05-05-04.1Z--1280x720.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-464099294.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Scott", "National Online Journalist"], "canonical_link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/4152522/taylor-swifft-stalker-arrested/", "title": "Taylor Swift alleged stalker arrested with knife, rope outside singer\u2019s home", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#133F6F", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Taylor Swift alleged stalker arrested with knife, rope outside singer\u2019s home -
