DeGeneres said so herself.\n\nThe 55-year-old comedian took some time out of her talk show on Wednesday to address rumors that have surfaced in the last several months suggesting she and de Rossi are split-bound.\n\n\"The other day I was at the hair salon getting these extensions put in,\" DeGeneres joked. \"And there were tabloids all over the hair salon... and on one of them, Portia and I were in the top right-hand corner. And I thought, 'Oh that's so sweet, they're honoring us.' But then I read the headline underneath. And it said, 'Ellen and Portia Marriage Crumbles.' And I was like, 'Oh, what happened? They seemed so happy.' And then I was like, 'Wait, I'm Ellen.' And I should know if that was happening.\"\n\nThe talk show host's monologue took a more serious turn -- at least for a little while -- when she shot down the rumors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so ridiculous to me. There\u2019s not one ounce of truth to any of it. I\u2019m very happily married. In fact, the only thing we ever argue about is who loves who more. That is all. It really is true,\" she said. \"And we argue if we\u2019d let a kangaroo carry us around in its pouch for a year. I would. She wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019ll change her mind. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be in the pouch of a kangaroo for a year? Hopping around. And she\u2019s like 'no' but anyway.\u201d\n\nAnd if an announcement about some big change in her life ever needs to be made, DeGeneres promised, \"I'll announce it here first.\"\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi married in August 2008 after four years of dating. At the time, the talk show host called herself \"the luckiest girl in the world.\"", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d28b6583b00003900dac405.jpeg?ops=424_244", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5592f0a21700002f0a252fb0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d261e983b00004d00dac064.jpeg?cache=DLFVLOLMkV&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2524bc24000051179350f4.png?cache=viET1XLEN4&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d1b69472400003500faa350.jpeg?cache=9GpV6J60vM&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ceefc152500005500dbd234.jpeg?cache=uGSKDIrHrq&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2740243b00004d00dac1bf.jpeg?cache=CGXTISAWUk&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d26503c240000ff349352ac.png?cache=JbKf5zIvlJ&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d275db82400009d1793540b.jpeg?cache=5yQWsxINH8&ops=424_244"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ellen-degeneres-divorce_n_4427217", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Responds To Divorce Rumors As Only She Can", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "keywords": "divorce The Ellen DeGeneres Show ellen degeneres breakup Ellen DeGeneres ellen degeneres divorce Portia de Rossi", "og": {"title": "Ellen DeGeneres Responds To Divorce Rumors As Only She Can", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1910, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ellen-degeneres-divorce_n_4427217", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"tag": "divorce The Ellen DeGeneres Show ellen degeneres breakup Ellen DeGeneres ellen degeneres divorce Portia de Rossi", "section": "Divorce", "published_time": "2013-12-11T20:36:09Z", "modified_time": "2013-12-12T18:46:47Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HPLifestyle", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Responds To Divorce Rumors As Only She Can", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "width": 1910, "height": 1000}}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b9db64ee4b03a1dcc8bdab6", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "divorce"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/tDEZtgU30jc?rel=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1386738000.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
