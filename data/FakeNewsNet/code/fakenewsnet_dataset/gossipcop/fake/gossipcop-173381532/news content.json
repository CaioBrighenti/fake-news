Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nInteresting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nThe tweets came hours after a federal judge in Washington state temporarily blocked enforcement of Trump\u2019s ban on entry to the United States for citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and refugees from around the world.\n\nU.S. District Judge James L. Robart wrote in his opinion that \u201cfundamental\u201d to the court\u2019s work was \u201ca vigilant recognition that it is but one of three equal branches of our federal government.\u201d\n\nRobart, a judge appointed by George W. Bush, said in his written order that U.S. officials should stop enforcing the key aspects of the ban: the halting of entry by citizens from certain countries and by refugees from around the world. He did not specifically address the matter of those whose visas already had been revoked.\n\nFollowing the Friday-night ruling, government authorities immediately began communicating with airlines and taking steps that would allow travel by those previously barred from doing so, according to a U.S. official.\n\nAt the same time, though, the White House said in a statement that the Justice Department would \u201cat the earliest possible time\u201d file for an emergency stay of the \u201coutrageous\u201d ruling from the judge. Minutes later, it issued a similar statement omitting the word \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n[Fact Checker: The number of people affected by Trump\u2019s travel ban: About 90,000]\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,\u201d the White House said.\n\nTrump signed orders on Jan. 27 not only to suspend admission of all refugees into the United States for 120 days but also to implement \u201cnew vetting measures\u201d to screen out \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d Refugee entry from Syria, however, would be suspended indefinitely, and all travel from Syria and six other nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen \u2014 is suspended for 90 days. Trump also said he would give priority to Christian refugees over those of other religions, according to the Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\nHours after it was signed, Trump's executive order sparked massive protests at airports across the country, as reports surfaced that dozens of travelers from the affected countries, including green-card holders, were being detained.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit the following day challenging Trump\u2019s order after two Iraqi men with immigrant visas were barred from entering the United States at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Within hours, federal judge Ann M. Donnelly issued a stay to stop the deportations nationwide, noting there was a strong likelihood the order had violated the petitioners' rights to due process and equal protection by the Constitution.\n\n[Justice Dept. lawyer says 100,000 visas revoked under travel ban; State Dept. says about 60,000]\n\nSince then, the travel ban has evolved as Trump's administration has attempted to clarify exceptions to the order. The Department of Homeland Security said the ban would not apply to permanent residents or green-card holders, dual citizens who carry a passport from somewhere other than one of the banned countries and those with NATO or U.N. visas.\n\nRobart's ruling Friday, which was broader than similar ones before it, sets up a high-stakes legal confrontation between the new president and the judicial branch.\n\nThe ruling is temporary, and the ultimate question of whether Trump\u2019s executive order will pass constitutional muster will fall to higher-level courts. Legal analysts have said the ban could be difficult to permanently undo because the president has broad authority to set immigration policy.\n\nLater Saturday morning, the State Department announced it would reverse its visa revocations, allowing previously banned travelers to enter the United States.\n\nTrump, presumably responding to the latest development, resumed tweeting his displeasure hours later.\n\nWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nAnd then again, an hour later:\n\nBecause the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017\n\nThough his tweet implied that \u201canyone\u201d could now come into the United States, the State Department's announcement applied to travelers from those countries who already held valid visas.\n\n\u201cThose individuals with visas that were not physically canceled may now travel if the visa is otherwise valid,\u201d a State Department spokesman said Saturday, adding that Department of Homeland Security personnel \u201cwill resume inspection of travelers in accordance with standard policy and procedure.\u201d\n\nMatt Zapotosky, Lori Aratani and Justin Jouvenal contributed to this article.
