Getty Images; Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP\n\nA report from In Touch says that Brad Pitt is dating 21-year-old actress Ella Purnell.\n\nA source close to the actress tells INSIDER that the report is \"completely made up.\"\n\nPurnell played a teenage version of Angelina Jolie's character in \"Maleficent.\"\n\nBrad Pitt isn't dating 21-year-old actress Ella Purnell \u2014 who played a teenage version of his soon-to-be-ex-wife Angelina Jolie's character in the 2014 Disney movie \"Maleficent\" \u2014 despite the reports.\n\nThe reports are \"completely made up,\" an individual close to Purnell told INSIDER on Thursday.\n\nAccording to In Touch, Pitt cast her as the main character in \"Sweetbitter,\" a drama he's producing for Starz through his production company Plan B. Pitt was reportedly impressed by her performances in \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" and this year's \"Churchill.\"\n\nAs a series, \"Sweetbitter\" is a project run by director Richard Shephard, who won Director's Guild of America award and Emmy awards for his work on \"Ugly Betty\" and is also known for his work on \"Girls.\" Casting director Laura Rosenthal is finding actors for the rest of the roles, according to Deadline. Pitt does not seem to be involved with the project on a casting level.\n\nIn Touch cites what it says is a source close to Jolie and Pitt. The source reportedly says that Jolie is upset with the relationship.\n\n\"She's furious about Brad's interest in Ella and her being cast in 'Sweetbitter,'\" In Touch's source reportedly said. \"She absolutely hates that Brad is cavorting with someone who played the teenage version of her in a film.\"\n\nPurnell is credited as \"Teen Maleficent\" in \"Maleficent,\" where Jolie played the lead role. Pitt and Jolie separated in September 2016 and are negotiating a divorce agreement.\n\nAngelina Jolie.

Purnell also reportedly said, \"He's always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.\"\n\n\"He realizes the huge age difference ... and that everyone would look at the relationship as a midlife crisis mistake,\" In Touch's source reportedly said. \"[But] he's taken with Ella's spunky, funny demeanor and formidable acting skills.\"\n\nPurnell is already an accomplished actress in her own right. In the past few years, she's had roles in high-profile movies like \"Never Let Me Go,\" \"Kick-Ass 2,\" and \"The Legend of Tarzan.\"\n\nA representative for Pitt did not immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment. Purnell's representative told us he had no official comment on the report.", "images": ["https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8ba6949e1cf3c008b4670-1920-960.jpg", "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8ba4f2f2d9240008b4684-750-563.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8ba6949e1cf3c008b4670-1920-960.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Shamsian"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/brad-pitt-dating-ella-purnell-angelina-jolie-maleficent-2017-10", "title": "'Completely made up': Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.insider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#111111", "date": "2017-10-19", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-19", "news_keywords": "Brad Pitt, Celebrity, Ella Purnell, Relationship, Angelina Jolie, Jacob Shamsian", "sailthru.tags": "Brad Pitt, Celebrity, Ella Purnell, Relationship, Angelina Jolie, Jacob Shamsian", "description": "A source tells INSIDER that reports that Ella Purnell, who played \"Teen Maleficent\" in one of Pitt's soon-to-be-ex-wife's most famous roles, are false.", "sailthru.description": "A source tells INSIDER that reports that Ella Purnell, who played \"Teen Maleficent\" in one of Pitt's soon-to-be-ex-wife's most famous roles, are false.", "title": "'Completely made up': Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source", "sailthru.verticals": "culture", "sailthru.title": "'Completely made up': Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8ba6949e1cf3c008b4670-1920-960.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8ba4f2f2d9240008b4684-1920-1440.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8ba4f2f2d9240008b4684-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Culture", "sailthru.author": "Jacob Shamsian", "og": {"title": "'Completely made up': Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source", "description": "A source tells INSIDER that reports that Ella Purnell, who played \"Teen Maleficent\" in one of Pitt's soon-to-be-ex-wife's most famous roles, are false.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thisisinsider.com/brad-pitt-dating-ella-purnell-angelina-jolie-maleficent-2017-10", "image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8ba6949e1cf3c008b4670-1920-960.jpg", "site_name": "INSIDER"}, "author": "Jacob Shamsian", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.insider.com/brad-pitt-dating-ella-purnell-angelina-jolie-maleficent-2017-10", "title": "'Completely made up': Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source", "description": "A source tells INSIDER that reports that Ella Purnell, who played \"Teen Maleficent\" in one of Pitt's soon-to-be-ex-wife's most famous roles, are false.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8ba6949e1cf3c008b4670-1920-960.jpg", "creator": "@JayShams", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "INSIDER": "Snapchat", "'Completely made up'": {" Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508385600.0, "source": "http://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
