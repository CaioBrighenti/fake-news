He was supposed to be there to watch over Kim, but no one could find him,\u201d a source told Radar Online. \u201cScott also told [Kourtney] that he is not Kim\u2019s babysitter and that the reason no one could find him was because he had overslept \u2014 ten hours!\u201d\n\nMORE: Baby News for Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian \u2014 Click for Details\n\nAnd we thought he was behaving himself after rekindling his relationship with his baby mama last month.\n\nWe first saw Kourtney and Justin, 22, together in December 2015 at The Nice Guy before they enjoyed time together at a karaoke club. She was allegedly seen leaving one of the Biebs' favorite hotels \u2014 the Montage Beverly Hills \u2014 at 4 a.m. the following morning.\n\nKourt's ex \u2014 who is the father of her three children, Mason, 7, Penelope, 4, and Reign, 2, was said to be angry about their hookup, which seemed fine since Kourt \"regretted\" getting together with the pop star.\n\n\"She\u2019s kind of beating herself up for ever getting involved with him in the first place, and not listening to her gut. She really regrets the whole thing,\u201d a source previously told Hollywood Life.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Are-You-The-One-Season-8-Episode-4-Recap.png?resize=200%2C113", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kourtney-kardashian-family.jpg?w=1180#038;crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kim-kardashian-getty.jpg?resize=652%2C500", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kim-kardashian-getty.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Justin-Bieber-Hailey-Baldwin-Kids-Promo.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/khloe-kardashian-getty.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Adam-Busby.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Khloe-Kardashian-Posts-Cryptic-Message-Tristan-Thompson-Jordyn-Woods-Scandal-.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C1592px%2C900px&resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kourtney-justin.png?w=1180#038;crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kim-kardashian-getty.jpg?resize=652%2C500", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amber Belus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kourtney-kardashian-justin-bieber-pregnant-baby-123197/", "title": "Pregnant Kourtney Kardashian Hangs out With Justin Bieber Amid Baby Daddy Drama", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "You would think the last thing Kourtney Kardashian needs right now is more guy drama \u2014 but that didn't stop the pregnant reality star from stepping out with her former flame Justin Bieber!
