Despite the fact that the singer\u2019s rep reportedly denied that Gaga was engaged to Christian Carino back in November, the huge pink diamond ring she showed off on the red carpet has people thinking otherwise.\n\nArriving for music\u2019s biggest night on Sunday, January 28, the \u201cJoanne\u201d performer looked striking in a stunning, custom, Armani Priv\u00e9 design. Picture-perfect smokey eye makeup set off her platinum blonde hair \u2014 which was even more impressive from the back, where it crisscrossed with black strings.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was her ring.\n\nGaga has been wearing the massive pink gem for at least a month or so, but this is the first really *good* look we\u2019ve gotten of it on the red carpet. The center stone certainly makes a statement, and it\u2019s even more lovely up close, when you can see that it\u2019s surrounded by a circle of smaller white diamonds.\n\nGaga \u2014 who is nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album, and also performed \u201cJoanne\u201d and \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d during the show \u2014 was spotted earlier in the day spending time with her love. Mother Monster has been dating the talent agent since the spring of 2017, but they don\u2019t seem to be in any rush to confirm the public\u2019s suspicions that they\u2019re headed to the altar.\n\nFor now, we\u2019ll just have to settle for their sweet social media posts and any future glimpses at that eye-popping ring.\n\nDo you think that pink gem is Lady Gaga\u2019s engagement ring?
