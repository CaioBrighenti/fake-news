It\u2019s long been a favorite spot for William and Kate, who have been there a number of times over the years, including for a babymoon when Kate was pregnant with Prince George. It\u2019s said that they were joined on this trip by Kate\u2019s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, as well as Pippa Middleton and her husband, James Matthews.\n\nThey aren\u2019t the first Windsors to set foot on the idyllic Caribbean island\u2014Princess Margaret famously had a house on its sandy shores, where rumor has it she\u2019d throw raucous parties on Macaroni Beach. Her former villa, Les Jolies Eaux, is now available for rent.\n\nIf Will and Kate choose to go out and about, they might head to Basil\u2019s Bar. The waterfront hot spot on Britannia Bay is known to be the setting for British blue bloods\u2019 wild nights, and its owner, Basil Charles, was a guest at William and Kate\u2019s 2011 wedding.\n\nBut taking it easy is certainly an option. \u201cThe beauty of Mustique is that there really isn\u2019t much to do,\u201d Vogue writer Todd Plummer explains in his guide to Mustique. \u201cThe staff of your villa can happily arrange some tennis time, maybe a boat excursion or horseback ride, but each villa on the island is such a delight that the best thing to do is ask your chef for a rum punch, lay out on a chaise, and soak up the sun.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5249db2c533565d2af2330/16:9/pass/00-social-william-kate-george-birthday.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "http://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5249db2c533565d2af2330/16:9/pass/00-social-william-kate-george-birthday.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elise Taylor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-family-vacation-caribbean", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William May Be Celebrating Prince George\u2019s Birthday on This Caribbean Island", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-family-vacation-caribbean", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William May Be Celebrating Prince George\u2019s Birthday on This Caribbean Island", "description": "A new report says that the whole Cambridge family is on summer vacation in one of their favorite spots.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5249db2c533565d2af2330/16:9/pass/00-social-william-kate-george-birthday.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William May Be Celebrating Prince George\u2019s Birthday on This Caribbean Island - Vogue", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5249db2c533565d2af2330/16:9/pass/00-social-william-kate-george-birthday.jpg"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "A new report says that the whole Cambridge family is on summer vacation in one of their favorite spots."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-family-vacation-caribbean, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "description": "A new report says that the whole Cambridge family is on summer vacation in one of their favorite spots.", "keywords": "Royals,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Royals,mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Living", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532120019.42, "source": "http://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
