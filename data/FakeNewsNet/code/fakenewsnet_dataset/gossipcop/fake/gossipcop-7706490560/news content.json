Selena Gomez reunited with her former Wizards of Waverly Place costar David Henrie in her first Instagram Story on Saturday, January 7.\n\nIn honor of the five-year anniversary of the Disney Channel sitcom's 2012 series finale, the friends shared some hilarious anecdotes and mused about what their Wizards characters, siblings Alex and Justin, would be doing today.\n\nWe had the best time last night. We dreamed up what our wizards characters are doing present day lol, and talked about the fact that I started all of @selenagomez social media platforms \ud83d\ude09 A post shared by David Henrie (@davidhenrie) on Jan 8, 2017 at 11:00am PST\n\n\"David, I think we should do a reunion,\" Gomez, 24, joked as Henrie, 27, replied, \"I think we should do a reunion where Justin is still running the college \u2026 and Justin has, like, 15 children.\"\n\n\"But you have kids,\" the \"Hands to Myself\" singer interrupted. \"Alex is for sure single.\"\n\nThe How I Met Your Mother alum then quipped that costar Jake T. Austin's character, Max, is likely selling sandwiches on the street. Gomez added that although her character might be single, she's still \"killing the game.\"\n\nHenrie also took to Instagram on Sunday, captioning a photo with Gomez: \"We had the best time last night. We dreamed up what our wizards characters are doing present day lol, and talked about the fact that I started all of @selenagomez social media platforms.\"\n\nWizards of Waverly Place aired from 2007 to 2012. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program in 2009 and 2012, and the eponymous film adaptation took home the same award in 2010.\n\nGomez has been busy recording the follow-up to her successful 2015 album, Revival, after a three-month stint in rehab, which she opened up about at the 2016 American Music Awards in November, saying, \"I had to stop because I had everything and I was absolutely broken inside. \u2026 If you are broken, you do not have to stay broken.\"\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
