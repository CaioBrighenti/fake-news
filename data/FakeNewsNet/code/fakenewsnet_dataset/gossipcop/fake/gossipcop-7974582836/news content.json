Magazine, as reported by Gossip Cop. The tabloid also alleges that Mariah and Bryan made a deal over what his stipend would be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, but keeping up the public perception that she\u2019s desirable is more important to her than money.\u201d\n\nOK! Magazine also claimed that friends are worried that Mariah might be wasting her fortune on Tanaka.\n\nBut Gossip Cop says that they reached out to Mariah\u2019s rep, who said that the rumors published by OK! are fake news. Furthermore, as Gossip Cop notes, Carey is worth millions of dollars. If the rumors were true, a stipend for her dancer boyfriend is probably not going to hurt her much financially. If Tanaka is receiving monetary compensation from Carey, then it\u2019s in his capacity as her backup dancer and for appearing on her realty show, Mariah\u2019s World.\n\nnull\n\nAccording to Gossip Cop, OK! has published false stories about Mariah Carey, including one that claimed she was beefing with Lionel Richie, who they claimed blamed her for the cancellation of their tour. The tour was actually cancelled because of Richie\u2019s knee surgery. OK! also previously published a story that Mariah and ex-husband Nick Cannon had a huge argument backstage at the Kid\u2019s Choice Awards. That story was also debunked by Gossip Cop.\n\nMariah is probably too busy cementing her status as an icon to worry about any rumors about her love life. As Logo reports, Carey recently launched an LGBT-centric fashion line to celebrate Pride Month. A part of the proceeds will go to GLAAD. Mariah was officially named an LGBT ally by the organization in 2016 to thank her for her ongoing support of the community.\n\n\u201cThrough her music and outspoken support, Mariah Carey has inspired and empowered countless LGBT fans across the globe,\u201d said GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis of the \u201cHoney\u201d singer at the awards ceremony.\n\nRELATED POSTS ON INQUISITR\n\nMariah Carey Relationship: Star Says She Is \u2018Single,\u2019 Prepares Special Day For Nick Cannon\n\nMariah Carey Drinking Problem Causing Star\u2019s Bad Behavior?\n\nMariah Carey, Bryan Tanaka Back Together?
