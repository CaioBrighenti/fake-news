This should be the happiest time of her life, but the reality star has been absolutely miserable, sources tell Life & Style exclusively.\n\n\u201cPregnancy has been hell for Kylie,\u201d an insider reveals. \u201cShe\u2019s crying every day. Kylie thought having a baby would be a dream come true, but instead it has been her biggest nightmare. Some days she feels like her life is falling apart.\u201d\n\nA different source explains, \u201cKylie feels fat and frumpy. She\u2019s gained 45 to 50 pounds, and although she knows this is natural for someone who is pregnant, she doesn\u2019t want the world to see her looking bigger. She feels huge compared to her sisters Kim, Kourtney, Kendall \u2014 and even Khlo\u00e9.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the cosmetics mogul can\u2019t count on her baby daddy and boyfriend of less than a year Travis Scott. \u201cHe really loves to party,\u201d a friend tells Life & Style. \u201cHe\u2019ll try to FaceTime Kylie at 3 a.m. and she\u2019s already been sleeping for six hours. They\u2019re on completely different paths.\u201d\n\nThe pal admits the pregnancy was unplanned and that the pair is still getting to know one another. \u201cIt\u2019s a really unconventional relationship, to say the least. They\u2019ve only ever been on about five dates!\u201d\n\nThough Kylie is set for life with a $50 million fortune, she\u2019s \u201cspending money like water,\u201d the source shares. \u201cShe\u2019s bored being stuck at home and is buying anything and everything because she has nothing else to do. Over the past few months she\u2019s blown millions of dollars on herself and the baby.\u201d\n\nBut at the end of the day, the brunette beauty is focused on being a good mom. \u201cShe already feels super connected to the baby because it\u2019s a girl,\u201d her friend says. But the insider adds, \u201cShe isn\u2019t planning on doing this again anytime soon!\u201d\n\nFor more exclusive stories, pick up the latest issue of Life & Style, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kylie-jenner-pregnant-miserable.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lottie-tomlinson-tanologist-e1562945068594.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ls-1807-jan-31.jpg?w=1180#038;h=1000&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kylie-jenner-pregnant-miserable.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/khloe-jordyn-combine.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sonja-morgan-e1562955065544.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-boyfriend.jpg?w=1180#038;h=690&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lala-kent-randall-emmett-e1562958407866.jpg?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kylie-jenner-pregnant-miserable.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Magazine", "Jan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/kylie-jenner-pregnant-miserable-152765/", "title": "Pregnant Kylie Jenner Has Never Been More Miserable (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "For the first time since September, Kylie Jenner was spotted in public on Jan. 24 walking around a construction site \u2014 and the pregnant 20-year-old looked extremely uncomfortable.
