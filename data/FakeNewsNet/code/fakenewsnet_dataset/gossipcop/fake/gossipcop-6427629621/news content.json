The couple seemed to have only been dating for a matter of weeks and there weren\u2019t any signs pointing to an engagement that we could have foreseen. However, Bieber confirmed the engagement just days later on Instagram, calling Baldwin \u201cthe love of my life\u201d. So with a Bieber and Baldwin wedding definitely on the cards, we\u2019ve put together everything we know about their upcoming nuptials.\n\nWhen and where did the proposal take place?\n\nThe singer asked the model to marry him while on holidays in the Bahamas. Bieber, 24, got down on one knee and popped the question to Baldwin, 21, in front of a restaurant full of guests at their oceanside resort, who were instructed by his security guards to put their phones away as \u201csomething special was about to happen.\u201d Bieber then confirmed the news just days later on Instagram on July 10, 2018 saying: \u201cWas gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast. Listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you! So committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindly.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of engagement ring did Bieber propose with?\n\nBieber chose a large oval cut diamond ring set in 18 karat yellow gold by Jack Solow of Solow & Co. Inc. Diamond Jewelers. The jeweller has since spoken out about making the ring, confirming Bieber selected the ring himself. \u201cHe had certain design elements that he wanted and he had certain expectations and I think we delivered.\u201d The jeweller confirmed Bieber began with the diamond and worked around it, with the designer even confirming he personally delivered the ring to the singer the morning the couple left for the Bahamas. Bieber also reportedly asked Hailey Baldwin\u2019s father, Stephen, for permission before proposing.\n\nWhen is the wedding?\n\nOn January 24, TMZ reported the couple have postponed their wedding until further notice. Just one week earlier, Page Six revealed that the couple had set a date, with a source saying the pair had sent family and friends a 'save the date' invitation naming February 28, 2019 as the big day. However, TMZ reports a source revealed a number of guests notified the couple they wouldn't be able to attend the wedding on that date, so the couple decided to postpone it until a later date, with a possible destination wedding now on the cards. The source told TMZ guests were notified to take February 28 out of their social calendars.\n\nThere's really no reason for the couple to rush their nuptials, since they are reportedly already legally married. It's rumoured the couple picked up their marriage certificate in September 2018 and staged a small ceremony at a New York courthouse afterwards.\n\nWhere is the wedding?\n\nA source told Us Weekly the couple is planning a \u201cvery small\u201d wedding, \u201csomething private, intimate,\u201d with the location being somewhere in Canada. \u201cJustin loves Canada and is at home there. It\u2019s a special place for him and he\u2019d love to get married there,\u201d the source said.\n\nWho is in the wedding party?\n\nHailey\u2019s aunt, Kim Basinger, revealed to Us Weekly that Baldwin has already selected her bridal party and confirmed her own daughter, Ireland Baldwin, Hailey\u2019s cousin, will be a bridesmaid, as will the bride\u2019s sister Alaia. \u201cOh, it\u2019ll be fun. Alaia and Ireland, they\u2019re in the wedding. So believe me, I just \u2014 it\u2019s cool! I think it\u2019s sweet. It\u2019s a very sweet thing.\u201d\n\nWho is attending the wedding?\n\nNo word on this yet but we can imagine the guest list will read like a Met Gala red carpet. Between Bieber and Baldwin, we can expect Kardashians, Jenners, Hadids and anyone in the same orbit as Scooter Braun, Bieber\u2019s manager\u2013think Ariana Grande, for example.\n\nWho is performing at the wedding?\n\nAccording to Page Six, Bieber's personal DJ, DJ Tay James, will be providing the entertainment on the big day. Post Malone has also told TMZ that he hopes to play a role in the wedding\u2013whether it be performing or playing a role in the bridal party. \u201cI would love to perform. For free. I'll be the flower boy or is that the ring bearer? He's very happy and I love to see my boy happy.\u201d", "images": ["https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/billie_cover1_web-3.jpg?w=1024", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-mobile-e28093-640-png-1.png", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-desktop-1000x56-png-1.png", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/8b2f019d09abeb5bb31fa386c5cb9b11", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a08a8064a8de23a7a38411a6a58c7281", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/app-store.png", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-rh-column-300x300-png-1.png", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red-mobile.svg", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/db3aa0f0935fa0c0aaff8a48d0c683d6", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2953d27c2f54cc587cfdd5c73c34928d", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f23cfea7cd39a532b60f86ad44734d4c", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/nav-close.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/9299c77d4ae00d91fb972efef036bc9b", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/03f6e9f78a44102c85c9342b6f6fb65f", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red.svg", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/78fa4010e516bc9421904a24b172f1ef", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/fc86586195e0ee96816f732799584208", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/e9a69373342c789dacede005bd2cfac3", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80bf4d4f4840daab4f18df57aa7ee0a5", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/google-play.png", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/vogue-au-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/314563cc081f0bbfa15f112405c45a1b", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/314e85001e928e3f765c5f963eaf73c0", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f7aef56bf5aa3e4d4f8138e45413757c", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5c022e493fd6c7d443d5ed8aec803055", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/7009c75a253fd18875c28b2d0d890760", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/6acd70bcca6c394e04b6fb1d443bf5e9"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/78fa4010e516bc9421904a24b172f1ef", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Danielle Gay"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com.au/brides/news/everything-to-know-about-justin-bieber-and-hailey-baldwins-wedding/news-story/d745248960237da78a1ef83d982df927", "title": "Everything to know about Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin\u2019s wedding", "meta_data": {"author": "Danielle Gay", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue Australia", "type": "article", "title": "Everything to know about Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin\u2019s wedding", "description": "The pop star is set to marry the model \u2013 here\u2019s what we know so far about their upcoming nuptials.", "url": "https://www.vogue.com.au/brides/news/everything-to-know-about-justin-bieber-and-hailey-baldwins-wedding/news-story/d745248960237da78a1ef83d982df927", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=200", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"creator": {"identifier": "vogueaustralia", "id": "vogueaustralia_id"}, "title": "Everything to know about Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin\u2019s wedding", "description": "The pop star is set to marry the model \u2013 here\u2019s what we know so far about their upcoming nuptials.", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=240", "src": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/78fa4010e516bc9421904a24b172f1ef"}, "site": "@wordpressdotcom", "text": {"title": "Everything to know about Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin\u2019s\u00a0wedding"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=270", "theme-color": "#000000", "google-site-verification": "1j07G6Nu2IDJrC-g23wwzTEjb-d0Va1h15olpbRuxYI", "article": {"published_time": "2019-01-23T22:35:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-01-23T23:35:05+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "application-name": "Vogue Australia", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Vogue -
