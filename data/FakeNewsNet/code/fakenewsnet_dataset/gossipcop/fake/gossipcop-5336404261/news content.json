Heidi Klum\u2018s boyfriend, Vito Schnabel, slammed rumors that he cheated on the supermodel after blurry photos surfaced online on Friday, June 23, of him allegedly kissing an unidentified woman in London while the star was in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe claims that have been made are a misinterpretation of an entirely innocent situation,\u201d Schnabel said in a statement obtained by Us Weekly. \u201cThere is nothing more to this than I was simply saying goodnight to a family friend and we went our separate ways.\u201d\n\nKlum \u2014 who is mom of Leni, 13, Henry, 11, Johan, 10, and Lou, 7, with ex husband Seal \u2014 and the art dealer, 30, have been dating since 2014, following her split from her former bodyguard Martin Kirsten. Schnabel, who is the eldest son of director Julian Schnabel, has previously been linked to Demi Moore, Elle Macpherson and Liv Tyler.\n\nAlthough she often publicly professes her love for Schnabel, Klum has also remained friendly with Seal, 54. Klum recently shared a video with the singer on the set of America\u2019s Got Talent, where he served as a guest judge. In the quick clip, the former spouses, who divorced in 2012 after seven years of marriage, walked together on the NBC show\u2019s red carpet as a smiling Klum, who is a judge on the show, held onto his arm.\n\n\u201cBack in step!!\u201d she wrote alongside the Monday, May 1, video. \u201cBringing my fave singer to my fave show to guest judge @Seal @nbcagt #SealAtAGT #LookOutAmerica#DontMissIt.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
