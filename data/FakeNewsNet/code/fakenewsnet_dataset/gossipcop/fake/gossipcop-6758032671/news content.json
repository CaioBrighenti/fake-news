All the behind the scene bloopers are just a way of the creators promoting the show and showing the characters in a good light.\n\nIn actual these are the problems that the cast have\n\nLeonard and Penny : These both dated for 2 years and then when they broke up the show had some serious issues as they did not want to work together.Till today they dont talk off set and have a grudge. Amy and Howard : There were reports which said that these two had a riff as Amy started to get more attention even though she came late in the show. Amy and Bernadette: They used to be very good friends but they eventually grew apart and have ego issues now. Howard and Penny ; Howard had a crush on penny even though he is married and also made a few inappropriate comments according to sources. ( This is just a theory and not 100 percent true) Leslie and Amy : These two had a major fight during shooting and till date haven\u2019t resolved their issues.\n\nLooks like Amy has the most fight and Raj is nowhere in these stories.", "images": ["https://qsf.fs.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favicon.ico-26-ae77b637b1e7ed2c.ico", "https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-225242503-100-jfstzpunnnqoouqlehdhfzxncxfwnjih.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://qsf.fs.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favicon.ico-26-ae77b637b1e7ed2c.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.quora.com/Does-the-cast-of-The-Big-Bang-Theory-get-along", "title": "Does the cast of \"The Big Bang Theory\" get along?", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.quora.com", "summary": ""}
