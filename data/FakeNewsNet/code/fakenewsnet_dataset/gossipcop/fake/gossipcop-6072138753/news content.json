Ahead of next week\u2019s finale, Lindsay looked back on her time as The Bachelorette, and revealed there\u2019s one key thing that she regrets.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m just honest, I\u2019m going to be 100 percent honest,\u201d the 32-year-old lawyer told Us Weekly. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say one word: Lee.\u201d Oof. It turns out that Lindsay doesn\u2019t regret any moves she made romantically during her time on the show, or anything she might have (over)shared on screen. Instead, she regrets one lone dude: Lee Garrett. She made her thoughts a little clearer by adding, \u201cI would have sent him home sooner.\u201d\n\nGarrett, for his part, offered something of an apology during Men Tell All, saying, \u201cI make jokes when I\u2019m uncomfortable in inappropriate times. It doesn\u2019t always come off right\u2026\u201d And while Chris Harrison told E! News that he hopes Garrett learned from the experience, fellow former contestant Dean Unglert wasn\u2019t ready to let him off the hook. \u201cHe\u2019ll say and do things and then when he\u2019s put on the spot, he will manipulate it to try and make people think he\u2019s apologizing and make them feel better about themselves, but I\u2019m not a fan,\u201d Unglert said.\n\nIf he is willing to change his ways, Lindsay is there to help. Replying to Garrett\u2019s apology on Monday, she said, \u201cYou can meet me backstage and I\u2019d be more than happy to give you a black history lesson and a lesson on women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope Garrett took Lindsay up on that offer. Then maybe he\u2019ll no longer be her one regret.\n\nWhat regrets (if any) do you have in your life? Let us know @BritandCo.\n\n(h/t Refinery29; photos via Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty)", "images": ["https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/relationships_header.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Rachel-Lindsay-dishes-on-secret-dates-with-her-fiance.jpg?auto=format&q=50", "https://bourbon.britcdn.com/assets/menu-icon.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Style_Content-Hub_1920x260_v4_lighter-version.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Rachel-Lindsay-dishes-on-secret-dates-with-her-fiance-promo.jpg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Issues_header_1920x5001.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://components.britcdn.com/assets/images/logo.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/beauty_1024.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://components.britcdn.com/assets/images/logo_condensed.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/food_header.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/home_header_1920x500.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://bourbon.britcdn.com/assets/x-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Rachel-Lindsay-dishes-on-secret-dates-with-her-fiance-promo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree O", "Desir\u00e9e O Is A", "Professional Bohemian", "Who Loves Anything", "Everything Related To The Arts", "Entertainment", "Pop Culture.
