After posting a picture of her reflection while on vacation, she responded to a commenter that said she lost weight. \u201cIt\u2019s called growing up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI loved my body as a 17-year-old athlete and I love my body now. Yes, I\u2019ve lost some \u2018baby fat,\u2019 but muscle mass from my intensive volleyball training in high school has changed over the years into lean muscle from boxing, and work stress can have its affect [sic], but purposefully changing my body has never been my thing. I still eat what I want, I\u2019m still strong, and I\u2019m still healthy.\n\n\u201cYour comment won\u2019t get me down,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut next time, please think about the young women who may read body-judgement comments and judge themselves as they see their bodies growing and therefore naturally changing, too.\u201d\n\nA year ago, the script was flipped. Her detractors would cite her non-standard curves as evidence that she landed jobs due to her social-media following. Blanca Padilla, a model who\u2019s walked in the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show, told Spanish show Al Rinc\u00f3n:\n\nMost of us have to conform to extreme measurements because otherwise we won\u2019t book any jobs while others have the privilege to say that designers love them despite their curves. Well then, why do they love you? Maybe your millions of followers on Instagram might have something to do with it as well.\n\nIt\u2019s not an unusual knock lobbed at Hadid and models of that ilk. But the same reason Hadid is criticized is why she\u2019s an effective spokesperson for messages of body inclusivity. Even though she\u2019s nearly six feet tall, her hair is flaxen like Helen of Troy, and her \u201ccurves\u201d are only out of place on some fashion runways, she uses her 21.6 Instagram and 2.83 million Twitter followers to champion a diverse range of bodies. She did so in this tweet from September 2015, for example:\n\nHadid originally kicked off her crusade at the end of September 2015 in the middle of Paris Fashion Week. She posted an Instagram that addressed Internet commenters who perceived her body as curvier than those typically seen on the runway. In it, she said, \u201cYour mean comments don\u2019t make me want to change my body, they don\u2019t make me want to say no to the designers that ask me to be in their shows, and they definitely don\u2019t change the designers\u2019 opinions of me.\u201d Her words received support from other outspoken members of the industry, like Ashley Graham and Tyra Banks.\n\nThe next day, Vogue published an interview with Hadid where she further explained:", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c1379e169027501c6ebcfa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-hadid-september-2015-ss04.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c13828169027501c6ebd83/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gigi-hadid-september-2015-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/575ae3e023ec979410fd4985/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Stephanie-Seymour-Kendall-Jenner-Gigi-Hadid.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac9636f114d3ca724a0db5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kendall-jenner-vogue-cover.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d00d2faef4f5d685d3a408e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Tibi%2520RS18%25200909.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c1382b169027501c6ebdaf/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/gigi-hadid-september-2015-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c1382b8fbf768838dc1f59/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gigi-hadid-september-2015-ss03.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/573f660223c1227948d0a3f6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/bella-hadid-cannes-red-dress.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c138288fbf768838dc1f2d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gigi-hadid-september-2015-ss01.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c1379e169027501c6ebcfa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-hadid-september-2015-ss04.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Paul Chi", "Josh Duboff", "Lauren Le Vine", "Kenzie Bryan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/08/gigi-hadid-body-shame-instagram-comments", "title": "Gigi Hadid Is Now Defending Her Leaner Body on Instagram", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Gigi has been a body-diversity advocate before, but now she\u2019s fighting a slightly different battle.", "keywords": "Gigi Hadid,vanities", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Gigi has been a body-diversity advocate before, but now she\u2019s fighting a slightly different battle.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c1379e169027501c6ebcfa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-hadid-september-2015-ss04.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Gigi Hadid Is Now Defending Her Leaner Body on Instagram", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/08/gigi-hadid-body-shame-instagram-comments"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Gigi has been a body-diversity advocate before, but now she\u2019s fighting a slightly different battle.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c1379e169027501c6ebcfa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-hadid-september-2015-ss04.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Gigi Hadid Is Now Defending Her Leaner Body on Instagram"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
