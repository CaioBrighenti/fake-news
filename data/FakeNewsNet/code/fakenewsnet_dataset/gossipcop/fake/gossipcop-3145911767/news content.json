At least that\u2019s according to an article that appeared in Life & Style. The online tabloid claims that an \u201cinside source\u201d spilled the beans, allegedly telling them that Aniston spent $200,000 on beauty since she\u2019s become single. But celebrity rumor watchdog Gossip Cop is on the case, and they say that the story is untrue.\n\nAs Gossip Cop notes, Life & Style claims that the $200,000 price tag includes the costs of personal trainers, Botox, fillers, and other products. The tabloid\u2019s \u201csource\u201d says that Jen started investing heavily in these beauty treatments back in February, and that her goal was to show Justin \u201cwhat he\u2019s missing.\u201d According to Gossip Cop, the article then quotes a plastic surgeon, who said that Jennifer looks like she has had Botox and microneedling done on her face.\n\nBut the doctor they cited has never treated Aniston, which is a red flag about the credibility of the source and the article. Gossip Cop reports that they checked with Aniston\u2019s rep, who said that Jennifer is not spending big bucks on beauty treatments so that she can get revenge on her former flame.\n\nPeople Magazine has previously reported that Jennifer Aniston is moving on from the split and made no mention of expensive cosmetic procedures. A source told People that Jennifer and Justin have had some contact since they broke up, but that they have no plans to resume their romantic relationship. Justin is back in New York, the magazine\u2019s insider says, while Jennifer has remained in Los Angeles. They also added that the former Friends actress\u2019s life hasn\u2019t really changed now that she\u2019s single again. She\u2019s still \u201csocializing with friends,\u201d and otherwise enjoying her life. Aniston is also in a new movie called, The Yellow Birds.\n\nnull\n\n\u201cHer friends always invite her out and to parties,\u201d the source continued. \u201cJen has a very caring group of friends that take care of her.\u201d\n\nnull\n\nGossip Cop reports that Life & Style does not have a stellar track record when it comes to reporting on Jennifer Aniston. They debunked a previous story of theirs in which they claimed that Aniston\u2019s friends were setting her up with men who aren\u2019t involved in the entertainment industry.\n\nAccording to Gossip Cop, Jennifer\u2019 rep stated that the article was \u201cbogus.\u201d So it looks Life & Style should not be trusted if you\u2019re reading or thinking of sharing an article about Jennifer Aniston or any other celebrity.", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-split-divorce-rebound-plastic-surgery-brad-pitt.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Audreyana-Michelle-300x170.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1472001486461948&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=478801082325642&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=250&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Grannum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4891029/jennifer-aniston-did-not-get-200000-in-cosmetic-procedures-after-justin-theroux-split-debunked/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Did Not Get $200,000 In Cosmetic Procedures After Justin Theroux Split [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
