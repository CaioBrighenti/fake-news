Why? 2018 has been a productive one for women, thanks to the actresses, journalists, athletes and other survivors who bravely shared their experiences with sexual assault, as well as Hollywood\u2019s historic launch of Time\u2019s Up, a movement stars like Big Little Lies\u2018 Laura Dern has been supporting since its inception this awards season.\n\n\u201cMany of us were taught not to tattle. It was a culture of silencing and that was normalized,\u201d Laura Dern shared of women, at the 2018 Golden Globes, adding that we should all aim to instill confidence in younger generations. \u201cI urge all of us to not only support survivors and bystanders who are brave enough to tell their truth, but to promote restorative justice. May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture\u2019s new north star.\u201d\n\nHollywood stars have certainly continued to take note of the positive changes, and have taken to their respective social media accounts to pay tribute to the progress made on International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nFrom Gisele B\u00fcndchen\u2019s ode to her daughter to Chris Hemsworth\u2019s sweet post honoring to the important women in his life, see how celebs are spending the big day.\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nIn honor of #InternationalWomensDay, I want to celebrate some of the women and girls who inspire me every day. These women resist inequality, insist on a better world, persist against all odds, and enlist others in our shared fights. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 8, 2018\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nLupita Nyong\u2019o\n\nThe Pantherpuff Girls are here for #InternationalWomensDay!

There was a time not long ago that women couldn\u2019t vote, or open credit cards without their husband\u2019s signature, or compete in the Olympics, or do their jobs without being harassed. That time is up. #TimesUp \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) March 8, 2018\n\nDrew Barrymore\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nMeghan McCain\n\nOn #InternationalWomensDay I honor my amazing mother @cindymccain \u2013 who embodies everything I wish to be as a strong, empowered conservative woman.
