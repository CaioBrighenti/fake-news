However, her oldest son Maddox Jolie-Pitt has been noticeably absent from the last two major events \u2014 and it seems he would prefer it that way.\n\nSources are revealing exclusively to Life & Style that Maddox, now 16, is rejecting the spotlight and does not want to follow in his famous parents\u2019 footsteps. \u201cMaddox hates the glitz and glamour that comes with being a Hollywood star,\u201d the insider says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really like attending any kind of showbiz event. He\u2019ll make a brief appearance if he has to, but celeb events aren\u2019t his thing.\u201d\n\nMaddox recently worked with his mom on her last movie First They Killed My Father \u2014 but he remained behind the camera as an executive producer. \u201c[She\u2019s] fun, funny, and easy to work with. She\u2019s a wonder,\u201d he told People magazine. \u201cI was trying to help wherever I could. That meant being a part of meetings, helping with the script, preparing shoots, and reviewing dallies.\u201d\n\nAngelina, who also shares kids Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne with her estranged husband, would love Maddox to join her on the red carpet but is not pressuring the teen. \u201cHe finds it all pretentious,\u201d the insider adds. \u201cMaddox wants to lead as normal a life as possible.\u201d\n\nAngelina and Brad split nearly two years ago, but it is being reported that the couple is still struggling to come to a custody agreement. \u201cThey had been diligently going along privately and amicably, trying to keep the focus on the family,\u201d an insider told In Touch. \u201cBut suddenly, Angelina reversed course when she felt Brad was pushing too hard to resolve the situation to his benefit.\u201d Hopefully, the couple reaches an agreement soon \u2014 for the kids\u2019 sake.\n\nFor more exclusive celebrity news, be sure to pick up the latest issue of Life & Style magazine, on newsstands now.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/maddox-jolie-pitt-now-.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chrissyteigen_59618315_643511069452717_8982793758464910363_n.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Carrie-Underwood.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lottie-tomlinson-tanologist-e1562945068594.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sonja-morgan-e1562955065544.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/maddox-jolie-pitt-now-.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/angelina-jolie-kids.jpg?w=1180#038;h=500&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/maddox-jolie-pitt-now-.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Magazine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/maddox-jolie-pitt-now-153900/", "title": "Maddox Jolie-Pitt Now \u2014 Brangelina's Oldest Rejects the Spotlight", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "As her divorce from Brad Pitt drags on, Angelina Jolie has been bringing her kids on the red carpet.
