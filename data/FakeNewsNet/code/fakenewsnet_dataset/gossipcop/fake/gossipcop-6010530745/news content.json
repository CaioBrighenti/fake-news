{"url": "www.goodreads.com/book/show/12299419-mystery-man", "text": "This will be yet another review where I will show off my fine skills of prioritizing. Forget the hero, the heroine, or the story. We have other stuff to take care of first.HOLD THE PHONE. No one bothered to tell me that Dog the Bounty Hunter was making an appearance in this book.Wait a sec...is there really a character namedAw, hell. Let's just kick this review off with the characters.- a.k.a. -He's a hot man. I'm not gonna lie. The hair, the skin, the dimples, the boots, the multi-national heritage. He's like a taller version of the guy who plays Ranger in the Stephanie Plum movie.Who am I to complain, really? Other than a weird fondness for mid-life crisis muscle cars, he's my kinda man. I don't appreciate that he put cameras in Gwen's house to spy on her (Really?!? You couldn't have monitored her from outside of the house?) but hey. He gives great sex and he's pretty to look at. Sometimes that's about as good as it's going to get.- a.k.a. -How the hell did this woman manage to get three hot guys willing to wage war over her? I could not stand this chick. After reading a book as long as this one was (and it was looooong), all I knew about her was that she drank cosmos, ate copious amounts of cookie dough, liked expensive shoes, and collected little black dresses. FFS, I would not want to hang out with this woman in real life. She had the depth of a potato chip. Although, I guess I can say that her big hair probably worked well with Hawk's camaro. At least they had a retro theme going on.Since I've already figured out that nothing major changes about the men in these books other than how they look and what their jobs are, I'm hoping that the future will bring greater variety in the female lead department. I want to see big personalities, not Sex and the City wannabees.Up and down. The first 15% was a lot of rambling about pop culture and side characters who weren't really in the story. Then things took off for a while and I was interested. Then we hit a downswing again when a couple of turf war issues repeated themselves. Then we hit an upswing, then a downswing, rinse and repeat. Gwen and Hawk were never really a believable couple to me until after they got back together for the last time andThe last couple of chapters and the epilogue were excellent. It's too bad that it took almost an entire book before I got excited about what was going on.What interested me the most were the side characters. I'm looking forward to both Mitch and Tack's books. I have the feeling that I might like those books better, so fear not KA groupie girls. All is probably not lost.Eh. I think I'm used to it by now. I get that KA apparently loves nickname usage, which is something I loathe when it's used excessively in books. But I think I know that it's just part of the package and you have to deal with it if you're going to read and enjoy these books.The squishy belly thing was just odd though. Gwen's belly got squishy a lot. I don't know if she was turned on or having indigestion.I've noticed this in other books of this author's as well. The sentence phrasing is very stilted. I get that it's conversational, so I'm not knocking that, but it's highly unlikely that every single guy you ever come in contact with is going to talk in the same exact style. Especially when you have a commando, a police guy (or whatever Mitch was, don't remember) and a biker all speaking the same way. Last I checked, there is no universal guy phrasing.Example : \"I was another type of man, the type they are, I wouldn't hesitate gettin' in there and muddling your head by making my play.\"As stated earlier, the last part of the book was pretty flipping incredible. The epilogue = outstanding.It's a first book to a series. Sure, there were some flaws, but I think there's room for growth. The book entertained me well enough to keep going, and often that's good enough. I have the feeling that my feelings about the series will grow fonder as I continue on with the rest of the stories.", "images":
