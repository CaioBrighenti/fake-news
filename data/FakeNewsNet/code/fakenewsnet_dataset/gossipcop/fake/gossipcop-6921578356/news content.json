The model, 29, opened up about the experience and what she worried about most about her ex\u2019s wedding to Meghan Markle in a column for U.K. magazine The Spectator.\n\n\u201cFriends are starting to get married, which means the dilemma of British wedding attire. Hats,\u201d Bonas admitted. \u201cWhy do I find hats so tricky? Tricky to wear, tricky to look at, and extremely tricky for the poor soul sitting in the pew behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the time I avoid headgear,\u201d she revealed. \u201cThis can prompt disapproving looks from the older generations. Last weekend I attended the royal wedding. The invitation clearly stated that guests must wear hats. Yikes.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

He also invited former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, who he dated on-and-off from 2004 to 2011.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan\u2019s Love Story\n\nIt was reportedly a dislike of the media attention and public scrutiny that came along with dating Harry that led to the demise of both relationships.\n\nImage zoom Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Alexi Lubomirski/Kensington Palace\n\nDavy said that she and Harry still kept in touch. \u201cI think we will always be good friends,\u201d she told The Sunday Times style section.\n\nWhile it is not common for commoners to invite their former lovers to their nuptials, there\u2019s royal precedent for inviting your exes to your big day.\n\nPrince William invited a number of women he had previously been romantically linked to \u2013 Rose Farquhar, Olivia Hunt, Arabella Musgrave and Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, who is Bonas\u2019s half-sister \u2013 as well as his ex-girlfriend, Jecca Craig, to his 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton.",
