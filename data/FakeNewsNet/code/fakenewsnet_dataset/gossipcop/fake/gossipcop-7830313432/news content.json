Documenting the negotiations with my sister was taking longer than expected,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cShe was kind, exciting and fun. Mariah is a woman of substance. But it was a mistake for her and a mistake for me.\u201d\n\nPacker continued to explain that he was in over $5 billion worth of debt at the time he met Mariah.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago I was terrified. I had $2.3 billion of debt at CPH \u00ad[Consolidated Press Holdings, his private company], over $3 billion of debt at Crown, I\u2019d just appointed Rob [Rankin as chairman of Crown], Macau was falling over and [sister] Gretel was on my doorstep.\n\n\u2018Then, a year later, I\u2019ve got China falling apart, the Australian casino businesses missing budgets by big amounts, I\u2019ve got Mariah breaking up with me and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018F**k!\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe father-of-three also admitted that his \u201cbiggest regret\u201d was getting divorced from his ex-wife Erica Baxter, who later dated chart topper Seal for 12 months.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is my biggest regret that I let my marriage to Erica fail. It is what it is and she is doing an incredible job with the kids and we are in a great place.\u201d\n\nCarey was left devastated when Packer ended their nine-month romance last year and she reportedly blamed Scientology for the split when their engagement was suddenly called off.\n\nInsiders claimed at the time that she believed Packer \u2014 who was a Scientologist between 2002 and 2006 \u2014 had been influenced by his business manager and former Church of Scientology spokesman tommy Davis, who Carey believed poisoned his mind against her.\n\nPacker\u2019s camp denied Scientology had anything to do with their split and instead, sources claimed he blamed it on Carey\u2019s excessive spending and the drama surrounding her as she filmed her reality show Mariah\u2019s World.\n\nThe pair were first introduced by mutual friend Brett Ratner at the premiere of Hercules in 2014.\n\nIn January 2016, Packer got down on one knee and proposed with a striking 35-carat diamond engagement ring, which was rumoured to be worth $10 million.\n\nShe is also still great friends with her ex-husband Nick Cannon, with whom she co-parents her six-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Sun", "images": ["https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/79e1e53e448ec34d95477be64db1291d",
