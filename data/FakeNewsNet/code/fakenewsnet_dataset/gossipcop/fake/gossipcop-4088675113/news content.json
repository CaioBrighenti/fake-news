They\u2019ve been seen repeatedly together , and they recently spent time in France at the same places and beaches. If you\u2019re keeping track at home, it\u2019s time to whip out a marker and make yet another note for the \u201cOk but they\u2019re totally dating\u201d column. And the latest evidence comes by way of Jennifer Lawrence .\n\nFor about a month now, Justin Theroux and Emma Stone have been sucked into a rumor that their friendship is a lot friendlier than either of them will let on. E! News thinks they\u2019ve gotten to the bottom of things, and they say the two are platonic.\n\nJustin and Emma have been seen most recently in France for a work obligation related to their respective deals with Louis Vuitton. Once source says that they\u2019re just hanging out as friends \u201cand colleagues were with them during the day [on Monday].\u201d\n\nJustin has also been \u201cspotted\u201d with fellow face of LV, Laura Harrier. They might possibly be dating, but it\u2019s not serious. Another source says that Justin is just casually dating.\n\n\u201cJustin is hanging out and having the time of his life. He\u2019s casually dating, but it\u2019s nothing more. He\u2019s in a great place and very happy. He\u2019s enjoying being social and meeting people from all walks of life. He is excited about doing new things and traveling. He\u2019s looking forward to a great summer of fun and just seeing where it leads.\u201d\n\nThe source adds that he\u2019s \u201cletting loose\u201d for the first time in several years because he doesn\u2019t have anyone else \u201cto be responsible for or to report back to\u201d and he\u2019s \u201cmoved on\u201d from Jennifer Aniston.\n\nI hope the source was serious when they said Justin is being social with people from all walks of life. I know I would be delighted to trade in a week of \u201cJustin spotted canoodling with Emma\u201d to \u201cJustin caught dry humping on a beach towel with Dame Judi Dench.\u201d\n\nPic: Wenn.com", "images": ["https://dlisted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/wenn33869840.jpg", "https://dlisted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/wenn33851858.jpg", "https://dlisted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wenn33864561.jpg", "https://dlisted.com/wp-content/themes/dlisted_44/img/dlistedbw.png", "https://dlisted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/wenn32304693.jpg", "https://dlisted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/wenn33916219.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ejSXfyZMwcbnr.gif", "http://dlisted.com/favicon.ico?v=1", "https://dlisted.com/wp-content/themes/dlisted_44/img/dlisted.png", "https://dlisted.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Screenshot-2018-05-21-11.10.05.jpg"], "top_img": "http://dlisted.com/favicon.ico?v=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://dlisted.com/tag/justin_theroux/", "title": "Be Very Afraid", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "wtgaXQuvduR_ynbFXYU1BBBEM-yaIh4zid2J5aq9r5Q", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Dlisted", "title": "Justin Theroux", "url": "https://dlisted.com/tag/justin_theroux/", "type": "article", "description": "Be Very Afraid"}, "fb": {"app_id": 662132140485214}, "description": "Dlisted | Be Very Afraid | Page 2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://dlisted.com", "summary": ""}
