Comey\u2019s gambit worked as another former FBI director, Robert Mueller, was named last month as a special counsel to the Justice Department to lead an independent probe.\n\nThere had been speculation that President Trump would offer his commentary on Comey\u2019s testimony in real time on Twitter, but he waited until early Friday morning to weigh in.\n\n\u201cDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication\u2026and WOW, Comey is a leaker!\u201d the President wrote.\n\nDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication\u2026and WOW, Comey is a leaker! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2017\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing transfixed much of the nation as Comey answered questions from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee about his dealings with Trump and his assertion that Trump pressured him to drop his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to Russian officials. The Senate is investigating the broader question of Russian interference in the U.S. election. Trump and his associates have strongly denied there was any such collusion.\n\nComey, who was fired by Trump on May 9, repeatedly stated that Trump has lied in his accounts of their interactions. He blasted the President and members of his administration for what he described as a campaign to \u201cdefame\u201d him and the FBI. Comey also asserted there was no doubt that the Russian government directed a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 election through hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email system as well as through other cyber-malfeasance.\n\n\u201cThere should be no fuzz on this whatsoever, the Russians interfered in our election,\u201d Comey said.\n\nThe Comey has hearing generated a tidal wave of media coverage and analysis that will undoubtedly continue for many days. About 45 minutes after his tweet about the hearing, Trump sent another message praising Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox and Friends\u201d morning show, which is known to be among his favorite news programs.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
