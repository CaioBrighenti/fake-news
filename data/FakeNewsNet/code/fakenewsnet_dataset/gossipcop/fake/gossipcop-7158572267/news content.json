While this is starting to sound like a quite sprawling tour already, there is also apparently talk of extending it to Canada, where Meghan lived (in Toronto) while she was filming Suits, for seven seasons.\n\nThe royal-related rumors\u2014particularly Meghan-related ones\u2014come fast and furious these days, so it\u2019s hard to know exactly how seriously to take this report. A trip that involves stops in New York City, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, and Canada, seems somewhat insane; on the other hand, they will surely visit the U.S. at some point soon, especially since Meghan is from here. (The publication notes that Meghan will be making an \u201cunofficial\u201d solo trip to New York and Los Angeles later this summer \u201cto see family and friends.\u201d We can only imagine what sort of comments Thomas Markle will be making if that trip does not involve a stop to see him.)\n\nVanity Fair has reached out to the Palace for comment on the report.", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d02b85f1af02cd7ed69ff29/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Duncan-hunter.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab056c0055288786e119/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/l-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d03acff76711f312e7fe6b3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Jeffrey-Katzenberg%25E2%2580%2599s-Quibi.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d00d2faef4f5d685d3a408e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Tibi%2520RS18%25200909.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_80%2Cc_limit/josh-duboff-square.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d05048028d8add457470b77/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-stonewall-pride.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kevin Fitzpatrick", "Tina Nguyen", "Nicole Sperling", "Josh Dubof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/prince-harry-meghan-markle-united-states-tour-report", "title": "Are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Coming to the U.S.?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "A new report claims the couple will be making stops across the nation.", "keywords": "prince harry,Meghan Markle", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "A new report claims the couple will be making stops across the nation.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Coming to the U.S.?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/prince-harry-meghan-markle-united-states-tour-report"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A new report claims the couple will be making stops across the nation.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Coming to the U.S.?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
