Specializing in dark volatile characters that seemed extensions of her wild-child restless self, Jolie won three Golden Globes for her roles in television movies and a best- supporting-actress Oscar for her portrayal of a young woman with apparent borderline personality disorder in Girl, Interrupted. She talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and self-cutting, and her love of knives. She and new husband Billy Bob Thornton wore each other\u2019s dried blood in pendants around their necks, and publicly bragged about their wild sex. At the 2000 Oscar ceremony, she talked provocatively about being \u201cso in love . . . right now\u201d with her brother, James, and kissed him with unsettling intimacy. To be sure, Jolie had legitimate pain in her early life\u2014her father, actor Jon Voight, had been unfaithful to her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, and the two split up early on. But it was First World pain. Being Hollywood\u2019s newest \u201cIt girl\u201d landed Jolie the title role in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, based on a popular video game. As it happened, the movie, an example of Hollywood\u2019s most vacuous, commercial, shoot-\u2019em-up instincts, was filmed on location in Cambodia. There, Jolie, who\u2019d grown up in privileged bubbles in Los Angeles and New York, witnessed what real suffering looked like: poverty, the loss of limbs from land mines, a generation of relatives wiped out. In this world there was no room for free-floating malaise or self-indulgent antics. And in spite of their profound trials, \u201cI found a people who were so kind and warm and open, and, yes, very complex,\u201d recalls Jolie. \u201cYou drive around here you can see a lot of people with many things, but not often expressing happiness. You go there, and you see the families come out with their blanket and their picnic to watch a sunset.\u201d \u201cI never woke up and thought, I really want to live a bold life,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cI just can\u2019t do the other.\u201d Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. She suddenly became curious about the world\u2014starting with the country she was in. One day in Siem Reap, Cambodia, she picked up a book that was being sold on the side of the road for $2: Ung\u2019s memoir. It was among the factors that inspired Jolie to find a greater purpose. In 2001, equipping herself with as much knowledge as she could, she contacted the United Nations and eventually became a goodwill ambassador for the High Commissioner for Refugees. On one of her first U.N. missions, in 2002, she returned to Cambodia to meet up with NGO workers who were dealing with land-mine issues. Among them was Ung, the author of that transformative book, who had moved to America since the war but had spent her adult years working on Cambodia\u2019s troubles. She had never seen an Angelina Jolie movie, but Jolie certainly didn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s vision of a movie star. \u201cShe was just a really cool human being,\u201d recalls Ung. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t mind getting dirty.\u201d On her relationship with Brad Pitt: \u201cWe care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.\u201d She and Jolie clicked and made a plan to travel together to a land-mine-filled part of Cambodia where Ung hadn\u2019t been since the war. Thus began a sequence that sounds as though it must have been written for a movie\u2014but it wasn\u2019t. They met up with a bunch of de-miners, took off on mo-peds, with only a flashlight and some extra toilet paper as supplies, when a monsoon started. Soaked, they went to bed in hammocks. Before going to sleep, Jolie realized she already trusted Ung enough to ask her about something personal, something big she\u2019d been thinking about\u2014adopting a Cambodian orphan. \u201cI asked her as a Cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me, an outsider, [to do that], or if that would be a nice thing,\u201d recalls Jolie. Ung was wholeheartedly supportive. \u201cAngie was maternal to everybody around her, not just children, but adults included. I wanted her to adopt me,\u201d says Ung. \u201cI was orphaned when I was eight years old, and so I think, when you\u2019ve gone through experiences like that, there\u2019s always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life.\u201d Jolie says that Ung\u2019s enthusiasm for the idea of her adopting was a deciding factor. Had she responded differently, explains Jolie, \u201cit might have changed my decision. It might have made it very hard for me.\u201d Ung has been in Jolie\u2019s life ever since and is now one of her few close friends. Jolie immediately set the adoption process in motion. A couple of months later, she visited an orphanage in the provincial town of Battambang, having promised herself that she\u2019d go only to one, that she wasn\u2019t going to shop around. But Jolie felt uneasy as she wandered the rooms, meeting the children. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a connection with any of them,\u201d she recalls. Last year, Jolie developed Bell\u2019s palsy, and she credits acupuncture for her recovery. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. \u201cThey then said, \u2018There\u2019s one more baby.\u2019 \u201d Baby Maddox was lying in a box that was suspended from the ceiling. She looked at him. He looked at her. \u201cI cried and cried,\u201d she recalls.\n\nAnd thus began a 15-year project, in which Jolie rebranded herself, expanding her world, her family, her career, and her image. She bought a house in Cambodia and became a citizen. In 2003, she started what became the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation, focusing on Cambodia\u2019s environmental conservation, health, education, and infrastructure. She intensified her U.N. work, going on dozens of fact-finding missions, to such global hot spots as Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, and Haiti. (She\u2019s now been on more than 60 missions.) She split from Thornton, who didn\u2019t understand her newfound passion. She adopted her second child, Zahara, from Ethiopia. In 2004 she met Pitt, on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, when he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. For Jolie, dating Pitt\u2014Hollywood\u2019s gorgeous, laid-back golden boy\u2014catapulted her to another level of fame. Though she has maintained that they didn\u2019t become romantically involved until he and Aniston had split, the couple wasted no time in exhibiting their romance for the pages of W, which did a 32-page spread of them playing house, with a pretend brood of five. Aniston was devastated. For Pitt, dating Jolie meant doing it her way, at least at the outset. It marked the beginning of his own philanthropic life\u2014in Africa, Haiti, and New Orleans\u2014and he formally adopted Maddox and Zahara. He persuaded Jolie to have biological children. She gave birth to Shiloh in 2006, in Namibia, then the twins, Vivienne and Knox, in 2008. In between they adopted Pax, then three, from Vietnam. They bought more homes\u2014in France, Spain, New York, and New Orleans. While Pitt, as a producer and actor, churned out one prestige movie after another (Moonlight, The Tree of Life, Moneyball, 12 Years a Slave), Jolie took a new chance with directing\u2014with In the Land of Blood and Honey, about Bosnia, a project inspired by some of the U.N. work she\u2019d done there. Together, they appeared unstoppable, the most creatively alive citizens on the planet. Nothing seemed beyond their abilities. They traipsed around the globe as a nomadic clan of eight, making art, doing good, and setting up home wherever they happened to be. They tied the knot in 2014, mainly because the kids wanted them to. They had the means to take along tutors for the children wherever they went. But Jolie\u2019s idea of an education meant immersion in the real world, to bring an understanding of one\u2019s \u201csmall part in the bigger picture.\u201d For a time, it all worked beautifully. \u201cShe didn\u2019t mind getting dirty,\u201d says co-screenwriter Loung Ung about Jolie. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.\n\nIt was 2012, and Jolie had recently finished In the Land of Blood and Honey. She wanted her next project to be just as meaningful, and Ung\u2019s story had at this point been with her for a decade. By the time they had a completed draft, the chance for Jolie to direct Unbroken, based on the best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand, had come along, and they put the script aside. After that, Maddox, who knew \u201cAuntie\u201d Loung\u2019s story, brought it up. \u201cHe was the one who said, \u2018It\u2019s time to do it,\u2019 \u201d says Jolie. She knew that Maddox would be deeply involved in the production, that he\u2019d be \u201cstanding there watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other. [So] he had to be ready.\u201d Jolie and Ung dived back in. Credited on the film as an executive producer, Maddox read draft after draft, giving comments. Jolie took it to Netflix, where chief creative officer Ted Sarandos signed on without hesitation. \u201cIn the room, she created a visual experience of what this film could be,\u201d recalls Sarandos. \u201cThe film is in many ways about the death of beauty, about the way the Khmer Rouge had killed all things beautiful, color itself, which becomes part of the joy of life. . . . That\u2019s what hooked me more than anything.\u201d Despite Jolie\u2019s Cambodian ties, she felt she needed a Cambodian filmmaker to help shepherd the project. So she reached out to Rithy Panh, one of the most famous filmmakers in Cambodia, who had lost family members to the genocide and had chronicled the Khmer Rouge in several documentaries, including The Missing Picture, which was nominated for the best-foreign-language-film Academy Award in 2014. She and Panh agreed that the only way this film could be made was if Cambodia wanted it to be\u2014not a foregone conclusion, given that Cambodians are still somewhat reticent about their painful history. (The Killing Fields, Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s 1984 film about the Khmer Rouge, had to be filmed in Thailand and elsewhere.) The war tribunals, which were set in motion in 2009 and are ongoing, have helped open up the topic. Still, Jolie was trepidatious and approached the country\u2019s culture ministers gingerly, explaining that they were telling not just Ung\u2019s story but also the story of a people. Jolie\u2019s Cambodian track record made the difference, says Ung. \u201cIn a country like Cambodia, respect is very much elevated\u2014respect for each other, respect for the culture, respect for the history, respect for the elders. Angie walks in Cambodia with this respect.\u201d Cambodia went all in\u2014closing off Battambang for days, giving the filmmakers permits to land in remote zones, providing them with 500 officials from their actual army to play the Khmer Rouge army. \u201cIt\u2019s not a poetic thing to say\u2014[this film] was made by the country,\u201d says Jolie. Between cast and crew, some 3,500 Cambodians participated.\n\nTo cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. \u201cSrey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,\u201d Jolie says. \u201cWhen she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.\u201d Jolie then tears up. \u201cWhen she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn\u2019t have enough money for a nice funeral.\u201d That authentic connection to pain was awakened in everyone involved, says Jolie, making for a film set like nothing she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a person who was working on the movie who didn\u2019t have a personal connection. They weren\u2019t coming to do a job. They were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family, and it was out of respect for them that they were going to re-create it . . . It completed something for them.\u201d Some had flashbacks and nightmares. For this reason, a therapist was on set every day. And then there were the odd bystanders who hadn\u2019t been aware that a movie was being made, and were traumatized. In one scene, recalls Jolie, \u201cwhen the Khmer Rouge came over the bridge, we had a few people who really dropped to their knees and wailed. They were horrified to see them come back.\u201d Given the size and complexity of the production, a different Hollywood director might have, consciously or not, muscled in and flexed her power in a way that might have seemed boorish. According to Ung and Panh, Jolie knows Cambodia so well she\u2019s internalized the country\u2019s character traits. At lunch, she waited in line like everyone else, recalls Panh, and she never raised her voice. \u201cHere we don\u2019t shout. We talk,\u201d he says. In Cambodia, yelling is not just disrespectful\u2014it\u2019s also considered a sign of weakness. \u201cI do not want my children to be worried about me,\u201d says Jolie. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Many eyes were on Maddox, who is as famous in Cambodia as Jolie. \u201cIt was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked,\u201d says Jolie, who wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d ultimately react to the experience. Would he connect? Would he want to flee? Jolie was thrilled one morning during the shoot when she heard Maddox say, \u201cCan I go sleep in my house with my friends?,\u201d referring to their house in the jungle, which she had bought back in 2002. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard him refer to it that way. You can\u2019t push it. You can\u2019t say, \u2018Isn\u2019t this great?\u2019 You just have to kind of keep bringing them there, putting it in front of them . . . and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort.\u201d She considers the endeavor to connect Maddox to his homeland\u2014as she does Zahara to Ethiopia and Pax to Vietnam\u2014a family effort, not a solo one. With that in mind, while Pitt was in the Middle East working on War Machine, the other five kids also went to Cambodia and played a role, official or not, in their mother\u2019s movie. Pax did still photography. The other four were on set every day and became close playmates with the child actors. In February, the film premiered for an audience of 1,000 at the outdoor amphitheater near the temple complex of Angkor Wat. According to numerous reports, it was a screening filled with tears of recognition, remembrance, and catharsis. What moved Jolie perhaps more than anything was that \u201cthe Cambodian people had a big movie premiere. They saw a movie for which they made the sets. [It was] their actors doing a great job, their country looking beautiful even through all the horrors.\u201d\n\nAlas, while she was making film history for a country, her relationship with Pitt was suffering. By the time First They Killed My Father was in postproduction, in the summer of 2016, \u201cthings got bad,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to use that word. . . . Things became \u2018difficult.\u2019 \u201d There has been Hollywood talk that their lifestyle had taken its toll on Pitt, and that he was craving a more stable, normal life for the whole family. When I bring this question up to her, it\u2019s the one moment when Jolie becomes a bit defensive. \u201c[Our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,\u201d she says quickly, adamantly. \u201cThat was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children . . . They\u2019re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I\u2019m very proud of them.\u201d Jolie has indicated that, for the sake of the kids, she doesn\u2019t want to talk about the breakup. And yet it seems she wants to get her point across, which calls for a careful choice of words, something of a high-wire act. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very brave. They were very brave.\u201d Brave when? \u201cIn times they needed to be.\u201d Other statements are similarly cryptic. \u201cWe\u2019re all just healing from the events that led to the filing . . . They\u2019re not healing from divorce. They\u2019re healing from some . . . from life, from things in life.\u201d I mention Pitt\u2019s mea culpa in GQ Style. Did it surprise her? \u201cNo,\u201d she replies, looking unmoved. I refer to tabloid reports that suggest their communication has improved, and ask if that\u2019s true. There\u2019s a long pause. She looks down, formulates an answer. \u201cWe care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.\u201d There\u2019s anger and pain right there beneath the surface. But she\u2019s trying to keep the emotions at bay. \u201cI was very worried about my mother, growing up\u2014a lot. I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it\u2019s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything\u2019s going to be all right even when you\u2019re not sure it is.\u201d JOLIE\u2019S JOURNEY Angelina Jolie, here with photographer Mert Alas (who tried on an astronaut costume), photographed at Warner Bros. Studio, in Burbank, California. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Her protectiveness over the kids has become all that more fierce due to her recent brushes with the specter of ovarian cancer; the disease took her mother\u2019s life when she was just 56, as well as those of other family members. In a 2013 New York Times op-ed column, Jolie chronicled her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after she learned she had the BRCA1 gene. Two years later, while working in the editing room on By the Sea, she got a call from the doctor saying that he was concerned about certain levels in her blood work that potentially suggested cancer. \u201cTen minutes later, the room\u2019s spinning, and you just think, How . . . ?\u201d She kept the news from the kids, did further tests, and waited a few agonizing days. When she finally learned she didn\u2019t have cancer, \u201cI dropped to my knees.\u201d She made an appointment to get her ovaries taken out. \u201cI went into the actual surgery happy as they come. I was skipping. Because at that point it was just preventative.\u201d She instantly went into menopause. Last year, in addition to hypertension, Jolie developed Bell\u2019s palsy, a result of damage to facial nerves, causing one side of her face to droop. \u201cSometimes women in families put themselves last,\u201d she says, \u201cuntil it manifests itself in their own health.\u201d Jolie credits acupuncture for her full recovery from the condition. Lately, her skin has become drier, she reports, and she has extra gray hairs. She quips, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s menopause or if it\u2019s just been the year I\u2019ve had.\u201d The idea that she could still be anyone\u2019s idea of a sex symbol is laughable to her. But she says, \u201cI actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I\u2019m being smart about my choices, and I\u2019m putting my family first, and I\u2019m in charge of my life and my health. I think that\u2019s what makes a woman complete.\u201d Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.\n\nApart from promoting First They Killed My Father, on Netflix this month, Jolie has no interest in working on another film at this particular moment\u2014her life just doesn\u2019t have the space for it. Right now, \u201cI\u2019m just wanting to make the proper breakfast and keep the house. That\u2019s my passion. At the request of my kids, I\u2019m taking cooking classes. As I go to sleep at night, I think, Did I do a great job as a mom or was that an average day?\u201d (But it is rumored she is negotiating to star in Bill Condon\u2019s remake of the 1935 film The Bride of Frankenstein.) She\u2019s reconnected with her father, from whom she\u2019d been estranged. \u201cHe\u2019s been very good at understanding they needed their grandfather at this time. I had to do a therapy meeting last night and he was just around. He knows kind of the rule\u2014don\u2019t make them play with you. Just be a cool grandpa who\u2019s creative, and hang out and tell stories and read a book in the library.\u201d Her main source of comfort has been Ung. \u201cShe\u2019s that girlfriend who rolled up her sleeves, got on a plane, and helped me on Christmas morning,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cShe\u2019s been my closest friend.
