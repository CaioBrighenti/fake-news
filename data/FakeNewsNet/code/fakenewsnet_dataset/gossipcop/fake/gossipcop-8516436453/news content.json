We know all those details. You know what\u2019s much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.\n\nAnd unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here\u2019s all the gossip leading up to the year\u2019s most anticipated nuptials:\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Meghan\u2019s dad?\n\nThomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan\u2019s relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they\u2019ve reportedly spoken by phone. An \u201cinsider\u201d recently told People magazine, \u201cLike any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.\u201d\n\nThen it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan\u2019s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it \u201cthe biggest mistake in wedding history.\u201d The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan\u2019s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.\n\nHowever, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were \u201cstupid and hammy,\u201d and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.\n\nEarly in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, \u201cThis is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: \u201cSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u201d\n\nAnd what\u2019s up with her half-sister?\n\nSamantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.\u2019s daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry\u2019s relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called \u201cThe Diary of Princess Pushy\u2019s Sister.\u201d (The two reportedly haven\u2019t spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a \u201cshallow social climber\u201d only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was \u201cabsolutely lovely.\u201d\n\nSo guess who wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a \u201clittle vulture.\u201d\n\nWhy did Meghan\u2019s half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear \u2014 maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.\u2019s son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? \u201cMeghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,\u201d he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a \u201cjaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.\u201d Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, \u201cWe are all still family.\u201d We\u2019re guessing that it did not work.\n\nHowever, Thomas Jr.\u2019s ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them \u2014 they recently landed in London, where they\u2019ll be acting as wedding correspondents for \u201cGood Morning Britain.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)\n\nWhat about her mom?\n\n\n\nDoria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they\u2019re extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her \u201camazing.\u201d Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.\n\nIs her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?\n\nMeghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: \u201cDivorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London\u2019s tabloid media, is next level.\u201d Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.\n\nHowever, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold \u2014 for now.\n\nIs there any drama on Harry\u2019s side of the family?\n\nHave you seen \u201cThe Crown\u201d? You have? Good. That\u2019s probably all the intense Windsor drama you\u2019re going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list \u2014 it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill \u2014 some distant relatives who were invited to William\u2019s wedding were not invited to Harry\u2019s. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don\u2019t know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?\n\nMeghan\u2019s eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, often called the \u201cPeople\u2019s Princess.\u201d Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan\u2019s overall popularity with the family and public.\n\nBut some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting \u2014 in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.\n\nWilliam replied, \u201cOhhh, yes,\u201d according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: \u201cI think it\u2019s really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].\u201d He then noted that they are all \u201cstuck together for the rest of our lives,\u201d to which Meghan added, \u201cTogetherness at its finest.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhat roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?\n\nA few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man \u2014 \u201cIt could be a sensitive subject,\u201d he joked on a radio show \u2014 Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won\u2019t have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry \u201cjust want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.\u201d William and Kate\u2019s older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.\n\n[Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry\u2019s wedding]\n\nAre Harry\u2019s exes invited to the wedding?\n\nProbably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There\u2019s also precedent: Several of William\u2019s exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles\u2019s then-ex-girlfriend \u2014 now his wife, Duchess Camilla \u2014 attended his to Diana.\n\nWhich celebrities will be there?\n\nNever forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from \u201cSuits,\u201d the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls \u2014 British royalty in their own right \u2014 likely will, too, along with Meghan\u2019s pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams. Despite their friendship with Harry, Barack and Michelle Obama will not be present.\n\nRead more:\n\nMeghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s bride: A \u2018confident mixed-race woman\u2019 marries into the royal family\n\nWhat to expect from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s royal wedding\n\nMeghan Markle is officially done with \u2018Suits\u2019 \u2014 here\u2019s how she exited the show", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CRVpK7_90DQuMNkn3C8TMzjijaM=/480x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GKDSVTSBBA7JJKWDNEOKAK36Z4.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BNUErODpmtboJVU8Y5nh5Ff7y2g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BZEEX5FKTUYTBHXUNLUB7V7XHA.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TXJKur-cQ3m4AF9lqk_kkjfemkk=/3x2/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "http://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BNUErODpmtboJVU8Y5nh5Ff7y2g=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BZEEX5FKTUYTBHXUNLUB7V7XHA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture", "Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "May", "Emily Yahr Is An Entertainment Reporter For The Washington Post.
