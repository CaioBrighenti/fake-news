The \u201cWe Found Love\u201d singer is reportedly \u201churt\u201d by the fact that the \u201cFake Love\u201d rapper\u2019s anaconda seems to be pointing in Nicki Minaj\u2018s direction these days. We guess RiRi still has feelings for her ex and longtime friend after all.\n\nMORE: Chris Brown Was Preparing to Propose to Rihanna Before Domestic Violence Arrest\n\n\u201cThings didn\u2019t end well when she and Drake broke up last year,\u201d a source told Hollywood Life. \u201cShe still has strong feelings over it. Seeing him with Nicki hurts, but she always felt like he was obsessed with her. Their connection comes as no surprise to Rihanna.\u201d\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe Canadian has never tried to hide the fact that his feelings for Nicki go past \u201cjust friends.\u201d Then again, Drake did make it very clear (to the entire world) how he views Rihanna during his 2016 VMAs speech.\n\nMORE: Jennifer Lopez Dumped Drake Because He Was Sleeping With Another Woman\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s someone I\u2019ve been in love with since I was 22 years old,\u201d Drake admitted at the awards show. \u201cShe\u2019s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life, I\u2019ve looked up to her, even though she\u2019s younger than me.\u201d\n\nHas that love changed? Or is the rapper\u2019s heart suddenly large enough for two women? \u201c[Rihanna] definitely has no plans to get back together with Drake,\u201d the source continued. \u201cAs far as she\u2019s concerned, Nicki can have him. In fact, she thinks they should go ahead and make it official.\u201d\n\nThe timing for this new romance couldn\u2019t be better since, apparently, Drake is looking for a wifey. \u201cDrake does want to settle down and have kids one day, and he\u2019s confident that the right woman will come along at the right time,\u201d a source previously revealed. Is Nicki that woman? There\u2019s no denying they\u2019d make one hell of a couple!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1156839684.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Love-Island-USA.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rihanna-drake.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nicki-minaj-and-drake.jpg?w=1180#038;h=600&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/90-day-fiance-ashley-martson-bikini-body-jay-cheating-Promo-01.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/MEGA46143_001.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rihanna-drake.jpg?resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rihanna-drake.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paulina Jayne Isaac", "Aug"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/rihanna-drake-nicki-minaj-138547/", "title": "Rihanna Is Reportedly \"Hurt\" Over Drake's Obsession With Nicki Minaj!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Apparently, Rihanna is no longer the only girl in Drake's world!
