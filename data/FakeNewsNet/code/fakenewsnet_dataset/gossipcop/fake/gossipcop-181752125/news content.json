When a photographer captured a rare photo of the pair together, walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach in September, they only became more cautious.\n\nImage zoom Felipe Ramales/Splash News\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Truth About Katie Holmes & \u202aJamie Foxx\u2019s Ultra-Private Relationship: \u2018They Are Both Very Happy\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter the beach pictures, they only spent time together at home and got extra careful,\u201d the insider says. \u201cBut this year, they have been more social together. They often go to restaurants for dinner dates, or to hang out with friends.\u201d\n\nThe duo sat next to each other at Clive Davis\u2019s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, played basketball together on Valentine\u2019s Day and were seen leaving Nobu restaurant in New York City on April 22, followed by Carbone on May 1.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

taking their relationship public, \u201cHer main focus is still Suri,\u201d the insider says of Holmes\u2019 12-year-old daughter with Cruise. \u201cShe is a very involved mom.\u201d", "images":
