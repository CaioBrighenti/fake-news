Magazine:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the healthiest I\u2019ve been all my life.\n\nMy diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape. I have no sugar. I don\u2019t eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar.\n\nI eat chicken and salmon and rice. I eat avocados. I\u2019ll have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch. I try to do just 1,200 calories a day. It may sound like it\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s actually a lot of food if you eat the right things.\u201d\n\nSome of those concepts are NOT OK with me.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the positives. She has clearly realized that a daily intake of Cheetos and Frappuccinos won\u2019t do much to help her get back in shape.\n\nAdditionally, avocados and salmon are a great way to get healthy fats.\n\nNow, onto the \u201cnot so great\u201d attributes.\n\nI\u2019d like to think Britney is pointing out just a few of the foods she eats, rather than her daily staples. Otherwise, she is on the fast track to boredom with such a small selection.\n\nAnd, hello, where\u2019s the fiber?\n\nMy main frustration, however, stems from her claim that, in order to keep a sugar-free diet, Britney has cut out fruits and fruit juice.\n\nFruit juice, I can understand. After all, most fruit juices are simply sugar (in this case, fructose) water with vitamins. Since they are in liquid form, they don\u2019t do much in terms of satiety, either.\n\nBut giving up fruit? I can\u2019t think of any reason to do that.\n\nThink about it for a minute. Doesn\u2019t it sound slightly ridiculous to say, \u201cI\u2019m eating healthy, so no more fruit in MY fridge!\u201d?\n\nA medium sized apple only contains 90 calories, but also provides fiber, phytonutrients, and a variety of vitamins.\n\nPlease don\u2019t mistake that recent study about fructose intake and weight gain to mean you should never have fruit.\n\nThe fiber in whole fruit offsets the sharp rise in blood glucose you get when you drink pure fruit juice juice.\n\nBesides, a whole orange provides significantly lower levels of fructose than a glass of OJ.\n\nSo, Britney, please don\u2019t fear. A banana in the morning or some kiwi in the afternoon will not lead you astray.\n\nThank you to reader Kristin MacBride for sending along Britney\u2019s quote.", "images": ["http://smallbites.andybellatti.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/FaceBook_48x48.png", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51f-6SDZ9bL._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg", "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/article-inline-half/public/blogs/35499/2013/07/129079-128285.jpg?itok=BlD_oeln", "http://smallbites.andybellatti.com/customimages/twitter.png", "http://shelfelf.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/hungryplanet.jpg", "http://hypnosishealthinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/The-Complete-Idiots-Guide-to-Plant-Based-Nutrition.jpg?cda6c1", "http://smallbites.andybellatti.com/sblogo.png", "http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:W3ZgVudazPURjM:http://www.grandhaventribune.com/blog/opinion/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/cornposter1.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM4MjY4NjU1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg4NzA1Mg@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg", "http://thesituationist.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/food-fight.jpeg", "http://www.naturalnews.com/gallery/articles/HBS-AppetiteforProfit.jpg", "http://i43.tower.com/images/mm107140312/food-politics-marion-nestle-paperback-cover-art.jpg", "https://gasoutherncri.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/forks-over-knives-dvd.jpg", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41f50oWE4UL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-arrow-click,TopRight,35,-76_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg", "http://lettuceeatkale.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/whatsonyourplate.jpeg", "http://smallbites.andybellatti.com/customimages/youtube.png", "http://calorielab.com/news/wp-images/post-images/food-matters-bittman.jpg", "http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1389124195l/17737058.jpg", "http://www.blogcdn.com/www.slashfood.com/media/2006/06/whattoeatnestle.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/OmnivoresDilemma_full.jpg", "http://tbn2.google.com/images?q=tbn:4DwqRc-dvKi4TM:http://www.bctaekwondo.org/Image/Super_Size_Me_Poster.jpg", "http://agwired.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/13-books-eating-animals.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q2hiuZPSL._SX200_QL80_.jpg", "http://fedupwithlunch.com/imgs/fuwl-book-cover-small.jpg", "http://bks1.books.google.com/books?id=c5seKQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VpW8JiTI9u8/SLQmzEbXI8I/AAAAAAAACZU/l8pukJKdbjc/s200/britney+glamour.jpg", "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/9fc/arts/books-and-media/book-reviews/article24216918.ece/ALTERNATES/pw220/Got+Milked.jpg", "http://www.everydiet.org/wp-content/uploads/eat-drink-be-healthy.jpg", "https://static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_171_16.png"], "top_img": "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_VpW8JiTI9u8/SLQmzEbXI8I/AAAAAAAACZU/l8pukJKdbjc/s200/britney+glamour.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://smallbites.andybellatti.com/celebrity-diet-secrets-britney-spears/", "title": "Celebrity Diet Secrets: Britney Spears", "meta_data": {"description": "I could care less how a celebrity dresses on the red carpet or how their hair looks when they're buying Advil at their local drugstore at 1 AM.I do, however,", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://smallbites.andybellatti.com", "summary": ""}
