Who doesn't love the over-the-top dresses , opulent bling , faraway dream venues, and star-studded bashes? That's why it's just so darn hard to wait for some of our favorite celebrity couples to tie the knot \u2014 like Demi Lovato and Wilmer Valderrama for instance, the former of whom fended off secret wedding rumors at the Billboard Women in Music event last night.\n\nWith all the celebrities sneaking off to top-secret locations for out-of-the-spotlight nuptials (we're looking at you, Aniston and Theroux !), it's not totally out of the question that Lovato and Valderrama would do the same. With five years of dating under their belt and their sweet social media postings, we're just patiently waiting \u2014 okay, maybe not so patiently \u2014 for this much-anticipated wedding to take place! But first, Valderrama still needs to pop that question !\n\nSee More: Watch This Adorable 5-Year-Old Boy Propose to Demi Lovato\n\nDuring her red carpet interview, Lovato fiercely denied the rumors that they were already secretly married. (And thankfully so \u2014 we want to see those wedding photos , after all!) But, according to Entertainment Tonight , she also alluded to the possibility of an engagement in 2016, saying \"You gotta ask him!\"\n\nSo let's have it, Valderrama! When are you surprising Demi with that engagement bling?! It sounds like Lovato has already been pinning away to her secret wedding Pinterest board (just admit it, Demi!), as she also recently revealed that she's been dreaming of a \"shabby chic\" ceremony in a September interview. \"I don't know if it would be in a barn, but I think I'd definitely want an outdoor wedding, with lights hanging in the trees,\" divulged Lovato. Ugh, we can't wait!", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5d179c696bc0270009e7347e/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1141025208.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e5041f3800bdd3118ad3c/master/pass/blogs-aisle-say-demi-lovato-ready-to-get-engaged-to-wilmer-valderrama-320.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e5bb9584381035c05b5f3/1:1/w_767/blogs-aisle-say-demi-lovato-engagement-secret-wedding-rumors.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5d278541191be20008b392dd/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1159849115.jpg", "http://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5c0b2eb7dfe85f02c786f44f/1:1/w_125/RYP_LM_Proposal-021.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e5041f3800bdd3118ad3c/master/pass/blogs-aisle-say-demi-lovato-ready-to-get-engaged-to-wilmer-valderrama-320.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/demi-lovato-wilmer-valderrama-secret-wedding-engagement-rumors", "title": "Demi Lovato Finally Addresses Those Secret Marriage Rumors", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Well?!
