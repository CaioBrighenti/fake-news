She's up for anything and (is) game to wrestle with whatever demons she needs to for the sake of the movie.\"\n\nLawrence split with boyfriend Darren Aronofsky last November, but recently said she still loved him during a taping of Marc Maron's podcast:\n\n\"I was in love with him for, like, two years... I still love him very much.\"\n\nThe Red Sparrow star spoke about the break up with The Mirror, sharing that she\u2019s now in \u201csingle mode\u201d:\n\n\u201cI am in the single mode where I am like, \u2018Cool, I can do whatever I want and I can be alone and watch terrible TV,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nShe went on to share that she doesn\u2019t expect things to change for her romantically anytime soon, suggesting that she will likely lose the positive attitude fast:\n\n\u201cAnd then, of course, in a few months I will be devastatingly lonely and feel like I'm on some long waiting list,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I am not there yet.\u201d\n\nUnless, of course, she and Edgerton kick off a new, adorable relationship... then she'll hopefully skip that \"devastatingly lonely\" part altogether.\n\nImage: Dave J Hogan/Dave J Hogan/Getty Images, 20th Century\n\nENOUGH WORDS!
