When Kris Jenner is exhausted in bed with too much on her plate, Kim Kardashian proves that she can take over her mom\u2019s job in a pinch, as seen in a preview for Keeping Up With the Kardashians' season 12 finale on Sunday, November 20.\n\n\"I've joked a lot that I could be my sisters\u2019 manager better than my mom could be,\" Kardashian reveals. \"I think I do give a lot of good creative input, and I know they, like, listen.\"\n\nHer big talk is put to the test when she volunteers to help out her mom with scheduling an Australia event for Kylie Jenner. However, Kris isn\u2019t so sure Kardashian can handle the workload. \"It\u2019s a lot of details,\" Kris warns her daughter. \"You\u2019d probably lose focus in five minutes.\"\n\nStill, Kardashian is unfazed by Kris' doubts. \"Why don\u2019t you just chill? I'll help you,\" she tells her mom, adding that Kylie will need security and one person to do hair and makeup. \"Have them pay for hotel, flights and a fee,\" she instructs, showing off her knowledge of management.\n\nKris, 61, assures the Selfish author, 36, that the job isn\u2019t as easy as it seems: \"It's 'take care of your own travel,' so I would need you to get on the phone with a travel agent,\" she explains.\n\nDoes this scare Kardashian? Absolutely not, as she fires back without hesitation, \"Let me get her on the phone,\" already dialing the number for the travel agent.\n\n\"I feel like I could totally handle this,\" Kardashian quips about Kris' position as momager. Clearly she knows what she\u2019s talking about.\n\nSee the clip above, and watch the Keeping Up With the Kardashians season 12 finale on E!
