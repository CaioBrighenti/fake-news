Critic Tom Keatinge hailed the production, writing that \"Peter Hall's direction and Anthony Ward's tremendous set combine with all this to make The Royal Family a terrific night's entertainment\", and that \"it provides a vehicle for acting of the finest quality, with strong performances from the whole ensemble\".[17] For her performance, Blunt was named \"Best Newcomer\" by the Evening Standard. She went on to perform as Eugenie in Nicholas Wright's Vincent in Brixton at the National Theatre, and as Juliet in Indhu Rubasingham's production of Romeo and Juliet at Chichester Festival Theatre, both in 2002.[16] In 2003, Blunt made her screen debut in the British television drama Boudica, about the life of the ancient Celtic warrior-queen who fought the Romans. That same year, she was praised for her performance as the 16th-century queen Catherine Howard in the two-part British television drama Henry VIII.[16]\n\nIn 2004, Blunt received considerable attention for her performance as Tamsin in the independent British drama My Summer of Love, a love story revolving around two young women from different social and economic backgrounds in the English countryside.[16] Director Pawel Pawlikowski gave high praise to Blunt and co-star Natalie Press, stating in an interview that \"Both Natalie and Emily were extremely different and very original, which is a rare thing nowadays. They avoid the obvious, and are capable of playing complex and conflicting attitudes. Above all, they had energy, which is key for a movie.\" James Berardinelli of ReelViews praised the film, calling it a \"gem\" lost in the \"hype\" of Hollywood blockbusters, and noted that \"Both Natalie Press and Emily Blunt [...] are superlative. They nail their cinematic alter-egos effortlessly, using verbal and non-verbal cues to tap into their emotions. They understand their characters and use their talents to bring them to life.\"[18] She shared the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer with Press.[19]\n\n2005\u20132010: The Devil Wears Prada and breakthrough [ edit ]\n\nBlunt starred opposite Bill Nighy and Miranda Richardson in the British television drama Gideon's Daughter,[16] based on an original screenplay written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, where she played the troubled only child of New Labour spin doctor Gideon Warner, played by Nighy.

Blunt played Emily, the senior assistant of Runway magazine editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly, played by Streep. Blunt and Hathaway were required to maintain a strict diet regimen for their roles, so much so that Hathaway later revealed that it made them cry.[22] The film was a commercial and critical success, grossing $326,551,094.[23] Though Streep garnered most of the attention for her role, Blunt's performance was equally praised, with Clifford Pugh of The Houston Chronicle asserting that \"[Blunt] has many of the movie's best lines and steals nearly every scene she's in.\"[24] Blunt was nominated the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture for her performance. She attended the 79th Academy Awards where she co-presented the award for best costume design with Hathaway, with both acting as their characters from the film.[25] Blunt then co-starred with Susan Sarandon in the independent drama Irresistible.\n\nBlunt's profile continued to rise, and in 2007, she appeared in four films: the horror film Wind Chill, the romantic drama The Jane Austen Book Club, the comedy Dan in Real Life, and the historical comedy-drama Charlie Wilson's War.[16] In 2008, Blunt appeared in two films, Sunshine Cleaning in the role of Norah Lorkowski, an underachiever who starts a crime-scene clean-up business with her sister Rose, played by Amy Adams. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008, where it received positive reviews, particularly for Adams' and Blunt's performances. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine commented \"This funny and touching movie depends on two can-do actresses to scrub past the biohazard of noxious clich\u00e9s that threaten to intrude. Adams and Blunt get the job done.\"[26] A. O. Scott of The New York Times agreed, stating \"Amy Adams and Emily Blunt [...] attack their roles with vivacity and dedication...\"[27] She then starred in The Great Buck Howard as Valerie Brennan, which premiered at the same festival.[16]\n\nIn 2009, Blunt portrayed Queen Victoria in the independent drama The Young Victoria, directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e and written by Julian Fellowes, which focused primarily on her early life and reign, as well as her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Blunt admitted to having little prior knowledge of the Queen, but after consulting her mother, found her to be \"remarkable\" and \"a very 21st century sort of woman.\"[28] Blunt's performance earned critical accolades, and she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama[29] and the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress,[30] among others. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly concluded that \"Director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e's images have a creamy stateliness, but this is no gilded princess fantasy \u2013 it's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant.\"[31] That same year, Blunt received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.[32]\n\nShe starred in the Toby Spanton-directed short film Curiosity, and was director Jon Favreau's first choice to play Black Widow in Iron Man 2, but due to scheduling conflicts with her role in the comedy Gulliver's Travels, she was forced to cede the role to Scarlett Johansson.[33] She also voiced Matilda Mouseling, the mother of the titular character, in the television series Angelina Ballerina: The Next Steps.

The film earned generally positive reviews, with critics praising Blunt's and Damon's chemistry.[36] Blunt was offered the role of Agent Peggy Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger, but like the offer for Iron Man 2, she turned it down.[37]\n\n2011\u20132014: Science-fiction and comedies [ edit ]\n\nBlunt starred in the 2011 British comedy Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m and co-starring Ewan McGregor and Kristin Scott Thomas.

Many critics took note of the atypically dominating role portrayed by Blunt, and Justin Chang of Variety noted that \"Blunt is alert, energized and emotionally present in a none-too-taxing role.\"[51] For her performance, Blunt won the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie.[52] A sequel is currently in development, with Cruise and Blunt expected to reprise their roles.[53]\n\nBlunt then played the role of the Baker's wife in The Walt Disney Company's film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical Into the Woods, directed by Rob Marshall and featuring an ensemble including James Corden, Anna Kendrick, Chris Pine, and her The Devil Wears Prada co-star Meryl Streep as the Witch.[54][55] Ironically, Blunt was pregnant throughout filming, while playing a character who is barren throughout the film's first act.[56][57] The film was a commercial success and earned generally positive reviews, with Blunt earning praise for her acting and singing.

The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim. Blunt received considerable praise for her performance, with Dan Jolin of Empire magazine calling it \"nuanced\", and stating that \"Her straight-arrow-sharp determination becomes painfully dulled,\"[61] and while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found her character implausible, he praised Blunt for \"[brazening] out any possible absurdity with great acting focus and front.\"[62] Blunt was nominated for her second consecutive Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie.[63]\n\nIn 2016, Blunt co-starred alongside Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron and Jessica Chastain in The Huntsman: Winter's War, which serves as both a prequel and sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman.

Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, written by Paula Hawkins, Blunt plays Rachel, an alcoholic divorc\u00e9e who becomes involved in a missing persons investigation. Though the film earned mixed reviews from critics, who felt that it failed to live up to the novel, Blunt received unanimous praise for her performance.
