And I need to make a difference. This is how I can make a difference, by being the woman who has this job.\u2019 It\u2019s the metaphor of: You are on a raft, you got away from the sinking ship, are you gonna pull everyone onto the raft with you? What if that sinks your raft and you all die? That\u2019s the sympathetic read. The nonsympathetic read is they want to impress their upper bosses and make money.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen considering women in powerful positions, it\u2019s also important to remember the male-dominated terrain they have to navigate. \u2018\u2018When male Hollywood executives make decisions, they are in touch with their 15-year-old self \u2014 that\u2019s who they\u2019re making movies for,\u2019\u2019 said one top Hollywood woman. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t really want to hear women\u2019s voices because that reminds them of their mothers bugging them to clean up their rooms, or their wives whining at them to come home when they want to be with their young girlfriends.\u2019\u2019 One top actress was even more explicit: \u2018\u2018I think it has to do with dominance, with sex, with getting and maintaining an erection. It\u2019s sort of aligned to the \u2018manspreading\u2019 phenomenon on the subway. Men want to walk into the boardroom and take credit for a muscular movie because it reflects on their own muscularity.\u2019\u2019\n\nLinda Woolverton, who wrote the screenplays for \u2018\u2018The Lion King,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Beauty and the Beast,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Maleficent\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019\u2019 believes that it \u2018\u2018comes down to this mythic fear that we can\u2019t handle ourselves. Or maybe the fear is that we can handle ourselves, that we are powerful, that we could run the world better.\u2019\u2019\n\nI think Miranda July, the director, writer and artist, best captured the maddening, nebulous nature of the sexism in the boardroom when I talked to her at the funky house she uses as an office in L.A.\u2019s Echo Park neighborhood. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s this ickiness associated with women that I think is the real misogyny always at the edge of things,\u2019\u2019 she said, looking off into space. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s certainly tied to how women can\u2019t get older. There\u2019s a very short time span when a woman can get into the world of power and be a delightful treat. There\u2019s a fear, when women make things, not just that it\u2019s going to be a flop but that it\u2019s going to be annoying and embarrassing and somehow incriminating. You picture Spike Jonze, the Duplass brothers, Wes Anderson \u2014 can I call them my peers? They might have a flop, but they will never have that ickiness.\u2019\u2019\n\nPerhaps this explains why many successful women do not want to talk on the record about the issue or push the cause. Some journalists who cover Hollywood note that female executives there are more girlish and geisha-ish than their counterparts in New York. As one woman, a veteran Sony producer, puts it: \u2018\u2018It never hurts to have a great pair of legs in Hollywood.\u2019\u2019", "images":
