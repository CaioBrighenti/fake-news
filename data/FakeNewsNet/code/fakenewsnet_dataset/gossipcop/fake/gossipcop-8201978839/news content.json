And in the end he spared me.\"\n\nWhile McPhee has yet to publicly share a photo of the engagement ring the 68-year-old musician proposed to her with, Eng (who has seemingly seen a sneak peek of it) described it as \"beautiful\" and \"classic.\"\n\nShe also seemingly addressed the news on Twitter, sharing a gif of Ariana Grande (who recently got engaged to Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson) accompanied with a ring emoji.\n\nA rep for Foster confirmed to ET earlier Tuesday that he proposed to McPhee while the two were vacationing in Europe. The two were first linked together last May, and by December of 2017, they couldn't seem to keep their hands off each other during a PDA-packed trip to Paris, France.\n\nHear more on their love story in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nDavid Foster and Katharine McPhee Are Engaged\n\nKatharine McPhee and David Foster Make Met Gala Debut as a Couple With a 'Nice Date Night' (Exclusive)\n\nDavid Foster and Katharine McPhee Can't Keep Their Hands Off Each Other in Paris\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-12/gettyimages-1063321470.jpg?itok=2eeS6rWC&h=c673cd1c", "http://www.etonline.com/modules/contrib/ctd_uvp/img/placeholder.gif", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/gettyimages-955745814.jpg?itok=Lxdzn9e7", "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/gettyimages-955745814.jpg?itok=Lxdzn9e7", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree Murphy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/newly-engaged-katharine-mcphee-explains-how-david-foster-proposed-105439", "title": "Newly Engaged Katharine McPhee Explains How David Foster Proposed", "meta_data": {"title": "Newly Engaged Katharine McPhee Explains How David Foster Proposed | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/newly-engaged-katharine-mcphee-explains-how-david-foster-proposed-105439", "title": "Newly Engaged Katharine McPhee Explains How David Foster Proposed", "description": "Plus, details about the 34-year-old actress' engagement ring were revealed in the screenshot she posted via Instagram on Tuesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/gettyimages-955745814.jpg?itok=Lxdzn9e7", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Plus, details about the 34-year-old actress' engagement ring were revealed in the screenshot she posted via Instagram on Tuesday.", "title": "Newly Engaged Katharine McPhee Explains How David Foster Proposed", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Desiree Murphy\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/newly-engaged-katharine-mcphee-explains-how-david-foster-proposed-105439", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/gettyimages-955745814.jpg?itok=Lxdzn9e7"}, "description": "Plus, details about the 34-year-old actress' engagement ring were revealed in the screenshot she posted via Instagram on Tuesday.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Katharine Mcphee, David Foster", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Katharine Mcphee, David Foster"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
