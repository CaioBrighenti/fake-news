REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque\n\nYou can't say he wasn't warned.\n\nLast week, former royal butler Grant Harrold spoke to ITV News about all the ways Trump could offend the Queen on his controversial visit to the UK.\n\nOne piece of advice was to always let the Queen take the lead when walking around \u2014 but it would seem the tip fell on deaf ears.\n\nIn a truly cringe-worthy viral clip, President Trump is seen breaking etiquette by walking in front of the Queen and then blocking her off when he stops, forcing Her Majesty to manoeuvre around him.\n\nThis breach of royal protocol led to outrage on Twitter as people called out the president for his lack of awareness.\n\nTrump was visiting Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle ( where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were married) and took afternoon tea with the royal after they inspected the Coldstream Guards.\n\nIn an interview for The Daily Mail that took place on Air Force One, Trump raved about his meeting with the Queen: \"The Queen is fantastic!\n\n\"She's a fantastic woman; so much energy and smart and sharp. She was amazing! Such a wonderful lady and so beautiful! It was such an honour to finally meet her. To have a Queen like that is great.\"\n\nAlthough Trump was apparently happy to meet with the matriarch, many in the UK were not.\n\n100,000 protestors flooded London's Trafalgar Square to object to the president's visit.\n\nAccording to CBS, it was the largest weekday protest the city has seen in 15 years.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b4c5f5142e1cc6e312a3404-1334-667.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b4c5f5142e1cc6e312a3405-750-562.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b4c5f5142e1cc6e312a3404-1334-667.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tom Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/trump-made-big-royal-faux-pas-when-visiting-the-queen-2018-7", "title": "Trump made one of the biggest royal faux pas when visiting the Queen \u2014 and people are outraged", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-07-16", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-16", "news_keywords": "The Queen, Royal Family, Donald J.
