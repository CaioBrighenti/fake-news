Newcomers include John Lithgow, who plays Fat Amy's sketchy father, Fergus, and DJ Khaled (as himself).\n\n\"It was so different to anything I've played before,\" Rose says. \"Obviously I've been in prison, I've kicked butt, I've survived apocalypses, I've fought sharks, so it's really nice to have done something entirely different.\"\n\nRose credits her church choir days for landing the role of the band's lead singer and rhythm guitarist. (Yes, she sings. And yes, she nails it).\n\nStill, her bandmates, Charity (Venzella Joy) and Serenity (Andy Allo), came with a little more experience: Joy is Beyonc\u00e9's drummer and Allo was Prince's protege.\n\nAs expected, Rose jumped in the deep end and learnt to swim.\n\nThe result? A fun, giddy -- and, at times, ridiculous -- sequel, which sees our beloved Bellas basically morph into superheroes to save one another all the while delivering those signature acapella beats.\n\nBring your gals and prepare to sing along.", "images": ["https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/7Oi9P7WlLBNFJ_lalVDFFwFcd90=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F05%2F29%2F08%2F34%2Ffooter-creative-146x82.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/-e5WZWAABLC9lJxzFRDLebH_9fo=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F07%2F09%2F13%2F05%2Ftherookfooter.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/PitJ6XKZTGg1gMCZ1V3QjRvVMYk=/88x88/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F1c5180b9-7d49-4429-9b5c-26fc81aad0dc", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/DikTfSa5UuzVlQ7nBUEpTZCL9fM=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F08%2Ffinderbluergb1800x427--new-footer-revised.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/vlKtby2o8QlBsxpLvcT3xbyzmHQ=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F04%2F17%2F11%2F24%2F146x82.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/GC33tde-EpJTHZ0qDAp0mXjwm0U=/396x223/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2F2016%2F12%2F28%2F08%2F05%2FFIX2812Ruby.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/5KzbMsOop5CF24PIrLPdiW9I2mA=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F03%2Fninecouponsblue.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/9zTejye347pZ35MA-1KzlJs1Mn0=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F04%2Fstan_lockup_blue_rgb-copy.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/BTwKo0O1jSbzFzPHov6lnTqU1fI=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F24%2Fdomain_partner_module_lrg.png", "http://prod.static9.net.au/_/media/network/images/2017/12/21/16/45/rubyrose2.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/3oDMNxaN29E9MRCxr8OiAG3E9lo=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F09%2F01%2F10%2F23%2Fnational.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/as9xok4lVnlVqLy3y46cJC37YME=/88x88/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fc040b7fc-9651-49c0-af56-e726711db453", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/jlYEcEIGLGoyZXLEr8MoDoxRpVk=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F07%2F09%2F13%2F35%2Fladbrokresred--revised.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/9VYvJaV1lR5_ocQXkPrkem2bfdg=/88x88/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F0f6d71bc-0168-4af1-a45b-f7aa9976eb6c", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/CaimkstihHQwsCMZmQFZpiayDW8=/396x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F12%2F22%2F11%2F02%2Fpitchperfectmain.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/C4boa_SOuCEE0_90Fp2y_19s78Q=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F07%2F09%2F12%2F59%2F146x82_nine_partnership_banner_no_text.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/CGE2hJsy-7k21ygJqjmmbSJbhCo=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F05%2F01%2F10%2F17%2Ffooter--february-25th-2019.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Uw8TvDi-X70Rjya-t-CSyyVEgZk=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F07%2F09%2F13%2F44%2Fmybudgetlogogooglelarge.png"], "top_img": "http://prod.static9.net.au/_/media/network/images/2017/12/21/16/45/rubyrose2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/ruby-rose-pitch-perfect-3-interview/80e1a0aa-6c62-4894-9850-6d78a2e4550d", "title": "Pitch Perfect 3: Ruby Rose reveals how Rebel Wilson stole her limelight on set", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00daa7", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/imgs/thefix/ms-icon-144x144.f93a8f07.png", "theme-color": "#00daa7", "nine": {"video-player": {"nielsen-plugin": "{\"apid\":\"P366BEB07-2E11-4EE0-B65B-0E24519B7560\",\"sfcode\":\"dcr\",\"nsdkv\":\"511,\",\"apn\":\"nineFix\",\"section\":\"nine.com.au Honey -
