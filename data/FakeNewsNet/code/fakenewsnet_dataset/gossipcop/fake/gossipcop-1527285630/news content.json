That\u2019s as intimate as the two get in the images and there\u2019s no evidence to suggest they\u2019re anything more than friends.\n\nRegardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that Holmes doesn\u2019t feel \u201cbetrayed\u201d when the actor socializes with other woman. The actor and actress have a somewhat unconventional dynamic, which People also noted in a recent article about Holmes and Foxx\u2019s secretive relationship. The publication explained that the two \u201cdon\u2019t see themselves as a couple in the traditional sense and they don\u2019t want to be labeled as a couple.\u201d It was further stressed that neither \u201cwant to have expectations placed on them about how they should be acting in public.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the unreliable magazine is trying to make it seem as if Foxx was caught acting inappropriately by talking to another woman, but he has nothing to hide. A mutual pal of ours and the movie star recently told us \u201che knows he\u2019s in a public forum\u201d when he chats with other women. As we\u2019ve repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes enjoy spending time together, but their dynamic is relaxed and both have their own separate lives.\n\nAdditionally, this isn\u2019t the first time Gossip Cop has called out In Touch for coming up with a variation of this phony premise. Back in March, we busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that Foxx \u201cbetrayed\u201d Holmes by \u201cgetting cozy\u201d with a mystery woman at an Oscar party.
