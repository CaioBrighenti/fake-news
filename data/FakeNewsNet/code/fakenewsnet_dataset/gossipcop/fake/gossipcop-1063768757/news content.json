While we don\u2019t see Stone herself as the anti-puppy type, her casting comes as no surprise\u2014not only because the actress has spent the better part of her career proving she can drive almost any film in a starring role, but also because we can already imagine her in that signature color-blocked bob.\n\nStone has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job. Take 2009\u2019s Zombieland, for which she dipped her natural blonde locks a dark chocolate. While she\u2019s often thought of as a redhead, she\u2019s actually only donned the fiery color for fun and film, trying everything from the warm cinnamon of Irrational Man to the auburn waves in Gangster Squad. Even as a blonde she\u2019s left no shade unturned: The Help may be significant for those wild curls, but we\u2019ll remember it for her pitch-perfect strawberry hue. Spiderman 2 saw her go paler still, but her part in Birdman took the peroxide even further with a shock of near-white layers. Now, as Cruella, she\u2019ll wear both the visual equivalent of the absence of color and every single color at once. Above, a look at seven films that prove that if anyone is up for a hair-color challenge, it\u2019s Emma Stone.", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/pass/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "http://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/pass/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-hair-color-cruella-de-vil", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-hair-color-cruella-de-vil", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet", "description": "The actress\u2014who has just been cast as Cruella de Vil\u2014has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/pass/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet - Vogue", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/pass/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "The actress\u2014who has just been cast as Cruella de Vil\u2014has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-hair-color-cruella-de-vil, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "description": "The actress\u2014who has just been cast as Cruella de Vil\u2014has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job.", "keywords": "Celebrity Beauty,Hair,Emma Stone,Hair Color,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Celebrity Beauty,Hair,Emma Stone,Hair Color,mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Beauty", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1461686112.0, "source": "http://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
