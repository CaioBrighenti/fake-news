Director Garth Davis and screenplay writer Luke Davies and the exceptional cast Dev Patel as the adult Saroo Brierley and Sunny Prewar as the young Saroo, Abhishek Bharate as brother Guddu, Nicole Kidman as adoptive mother Sue Brierley, and Rooney Mara as girlfriend Lucy present a moving story filled with immense emotion. This is not simply a film of a young 5 year-old boy that loses his way, it is film about a journey with much deeper meaning.\n\n\n\nThe film is based on the experience of Saroo Brierley and the book A Long way Home. Within the exotic and beautiful landscape that takes Saroo from his home in what he remembered as Gunestelay, which was a small village of Gunes Talai in Khandwa, India to Calcutta some 1,600 miles away after getting lost and a couple years later being adopted by the Brierleys in Tasmania, Australia. Twenty years passed and as an adult, Saroo's past comes back to him after a party he attends with Lucy and he comes across a blast from the past, a childhood dream to eat and own as many jabelies that his brother Guddu promised he would buy all of them. It is those moments that may tug at one's emotions and proceeding scenes when Saroo begins a journey thereafter to find a way to find out where he came from before being adopted. within the storyline there is an underlying meaning that relates to family and home, especially within Indian tradition that the films show through the Indian landscape, religious tones, and the folktales of ancient past that never get old such as the story of Rama and the long journey he takes to find inner peace during personal turmoil. like Rama, Saroo finally returns home.\n\n\n\nLion is a highly recommended film that may stir great enlightenment and meaning to understanding the plight of a young boy.", "images": ["http://www.amazon.com/Lion-Dev-Patel/dp/B01MT3LMT4/uedata/unsticky/139-1252918-5600104/Video/ntpoffrw?noscript&id=8JVXZ14CDAND3DRKK9H7&pty=Detail&spty=Movie&pti=B01MT3LMT4", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ejs3-67SL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/9109AG3zfnL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global_bluebeacon-1x_optimized_layout1._CB468670774_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DBAsROwyL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wwzswEYLL._SX300_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91zPCrqeS4L._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91YOgo2JLYL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Events/2019/01112499/gw-armadillo-desktop-en/us_armadillo_gw_dt_swm_400x39_a_en._CB461720680_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91UZaQCG44L._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Uj2LAKXlL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/915ENJueqgL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "http://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:139-1252918-5600104:8JVXZ14CDAND3DRKK9H7$uedata=s:%2FLion-Dev-Patel%2Fdp%2FB01MT3LMT4%2Fuedata%2Funsticky%2F139-1252918-5600104%2FVideo%2Fntpoffrw%3Fstaticb%26id%3D8JVXZ14CDAND3DRKK9H7%26pty%3DDetail%26spty%3DTVSeason%26pti%3DB000NMHNWS:1000", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81fTqCDp0DL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91uWpZlrLfL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1+BDcT6dnL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81LBaKsMrsL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/811W7NiLnWL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81vDOnyu6sL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "http://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:139-1252918-5600104:8JVXZ14CDAND3DRKK9H7$uedata=s:%2FLion-Dev-Patel%2Fdp%2FB01MT3LMT4%2Fuedata%2Funsticky%2F139-1252918-5600104%2FVideo%2Fntpoffrw%3Fnoscript%26id%3D8JVXZ14CDAND3DRKK9H7%26pty%3DDetail%26spty%3DMovie%26pti%3DB01MT3LMT4:2000", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/cbd4a859-8770-41b9-9362-99aaa9f34769._CR0,0,389,389_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814W7Qt0zIL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FCn1RU07L._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/94b04703-db55-48d2-a0d5-32a3adfa88cd._CR174,0,1530,1530_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81p-3QyEXaL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/8efd3f44-4bfd-4f7a-9487-f7a42d61c4ca._CR0,0,442,442_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1+hmToFNeL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91LpR44Tk+L._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/f2a4db9f-7b20-4e8b-b93a-2fae2a2fff8f._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/463f4dfa-96d7-4c57-a0d7-7a0120e5486d._CR65,0,370,370_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-LvNONnYL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wwzswEYLL._SX300_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.amazon.com/Lion-Dev-Patel/dp/B01MT3LMT4", "title": "Amazon.com: Watch Lion", "meta_data": {"description": "A 5 yr old boy gets lost on the streets of Calcutta, thousands of kilometers from home.
