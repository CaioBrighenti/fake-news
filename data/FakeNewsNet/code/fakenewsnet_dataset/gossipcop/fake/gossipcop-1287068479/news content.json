Add Interest\n\nThe day also marked the big reveal for the fashion world -- after months of anticipation and speculation -- of the wedding dress and designer Clare Waight Keller. Keeping the secret of who would design the royal wedding gown under wraps was no easy task, according to ABC News' royal contributor Omid Scobie.\n\nReuters\n\nMarkle, who already had a stash of bridal dress \"inspo\" pictures saved on her phone from Instagram, Pinterest and elsewhere online, began her search for a designer at the urging of her best friend, Jessica Mulroney, according to Scobie, who revealed details of the dress selection process in a Harper's Bazaar article.\n\nMarkle, now the Duchess of Sussex, already knew what she wanted in her wedding dress: something timeless, elegant and appropriate, Scobie added.\n\nWhile many designers threw their names in the running to be picked by Markle to design her dress, Waight Keller had been a favorite since the beginning. The designer and bride to be met just before Christmas, Scobie said, and Markle immediately liked what she saw.\n\nAndrew Matthews/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI think she had seen my work and knew what I did,\u201d Waight Keller said in comments to the press after the wedding. \u201cI think she loved the fact that I was a British designer and working in a house such as Givenchy, which has its roots in a classical, beautiful style from the time of Hubert [de Givenchy] himself.\u201d\n\nAfter Markle officially chose Waight Keller to create her dress, the designer had to keep it a secret from everyone, even her own family, until the wedding day.\n\nMostly through discreet texts and phone calls, Markle and Waight Keller went back and forth on designing the dress before two teams signed nondisclosure agreements and got to work on it at Givenchy's Paris headquarters and an undisclosed London warehouse, according to Scobie.\n\nReuters\n\nCreating the iconic dress \"was all about keeping the secret,\" Waight Keller said.\n\nHundreds of hours of meticulous stitching later, the finished gown was transported to Windsor Castle for a final fitting in May and was revealed to the world last Saturday.\n\nAndrew Matthews/AFP/Getty Images\n\nKeller called the royal wedding a \"dream day\" in a post on Instagram.\n\nWaight Keller also told the press that Prince Harry thanked her for designing the dress for his bride.\n\n\"He came straight up to me and he said, 'Oh my God, thank you! She looks absolutely stunning,'\" Waight Keller recalled. \"Well, I think everybody saw on television -- he was absolutely in awe, I think. She looked just incredible and it showed.\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/harry-meghan-kiss-02-royal-wedding-ap-jef-180519_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/harry-meghan-church-exit-02-royal-wedding-ap-jef-180519_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-stairs-harry-meghan-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-stairs-train-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-stairs-train-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-stairs-train-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_12x5_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-stairs-train-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/secret-making-meghan-markles-royal-wedding-gown-55397129", "title": "The 'secret' making of Meghan Markle's royal wedding gown", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The custom gown was designed by Givenchy's first female artistic director.", "keywords": "Meghan Markle, wedding dress, untold story,good morning america, morning news, robin roberts, lara spencer, josh eliott, sam champion, gma", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "The 'secret' making of Meghan Markle's royal wedding gown", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "The 'secret' making of Meghan Markle's royal wedding gown", "description": "The custom gown was designed by Givenchy's first female artistic director.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/secret-making-meghan-markles-royal-wedding-gown/story?id=55397129", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-stairs-train-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, wedding dress, untold story", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "The 'secret' making of Meghan Markle's royal wedding gown", "description": "The custom gown was designed by Givenchy's first female artistic director.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/secret-making-meghan-markles-royal-wedding-gown/story?id=55397129", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-stairs-train-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,55397129", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,55397129", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/secret-making-meghan-markles-royal-wedding-gown/story?id=55397129"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,55397129", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,55397129", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/secret-making-meghan-markles-royal-wedding-gown/story?id=55397129", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/secret-making-meghan-markles-royal-wedding-gown/story?id=55397129"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
