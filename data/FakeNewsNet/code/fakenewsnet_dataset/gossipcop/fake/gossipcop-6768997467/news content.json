According to a so-called \u201csource,\u201d it was Witherspoon\u2019s idea to bury the hatchet between the two. \u201cFor years, Reese has had to delicately balance the friendships and it hasn\u2019t been easy at times,\u201d says the supposed insider. \u201cBut she decided enough was enough and encouraged both of them to attend.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe outlet\u2019s questionable tipster goes on to say that Aniston approached Jolie first, and when she did so, \u201ceveryone in the room was suddenly aware of what was going on and you could feel the tension.\u201d As the story goes, the conversation turned out to be \u201cextremely courteous and civil.\u201d The \u201cinsider\u201d says Brad Pitt\u2019s name was never mentioned, but Jolie did tell Aniston \u201cshe was sorry to hear of her split\u201d from Justin Theroux.\n\n\n\nThe seemingly phony tipster concludes, \u201cReese was so proud of them for being so mature and poised. She had been secretly worried that having them both there could ruin her evening, but it all went amazingly well.\u201d But while the magazine hides behind an untraceable \u201csource,\u201d Aniston\u2019s spokesperson tells Gossip Cop on the record that the tabloid\u2019s story is \u201cmade-up.\u201d In fact, there\u2019s nothing to indicate that Witherspoon even had a birthday bash this year. It has made headlines in past years when the actress would celebrate her birthday with famous friends, but no such party was reported this year.", "images": ["https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/d/drive-thru-marijuana-store-opens-in-colorado-8862e7ad7120819.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/b/bride-1bd63718702c29ccd16544053c7c8537a559d2d5.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/7/75-year-royal-ale-found-3e5cb6617d38c8e7788d14b4d8d196ae9973bfe6", "http://a.collective-media.net/seg/etu/1b", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/download/file.php?avatar=273334_1466452579.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/s/sleeping-with-a-fan-on-can-be-bad-for-your-health-e52c8c3bc.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/n/new-species-of-lizard-found-in-stomach-of-dinosaur-2775a85f0.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/a/atm-machine-dispenses-cupcakes-124046e05e25a165a8feb55805fce.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/3/3m-long-great-white-eaten-3d3a3589edd92ff9a8ad43941775747df9.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/m/meet-britains-85-year-old-prostitute-ed5b2f14fd18f63b45ead77.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/b/british-man-sells-air-for-200-4fe09e4e12d69b7a4005b32a4bf929.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/m/mothers-ghost-friend-c98a085b9cf41b82b1e59d1d567fbffaa5194cd.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/eusa_clap.gif", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png"], "top_img": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/d/drive-thru-marijuana-store-opens-in-colorado-8862e7ad7120819.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=751352", "title": "Female First Forum", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}
