I just have always been that girl. I will give my heart and my soul to the person that I love. It's just how I operate. With that comes a lot, you know?\"\n\nSelena Gomez and The Weeknd attend the \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garcons: Art Of The In-Between\" Costume Institute Gala at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 1, 2017 in New York City.

Picture: Instagram\n\n\"That's what my break was really about. I could've had a stroke.\"\n\n\"I wanted so badly to say, 'You guys have no idea. I'm in chemotherapy. You're a**holes.' I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.\"\n\n\"I'm so f***ing nice to everybody, and everyone is so vile to me. I've been working since I was 7. I've been a UNICEF ambassador since I was 17,\" she says. \"It's so disappointing that I've become a tabloid story. That hate motivated me.\"\n\nOnline Editors", "images": ["https://cdn-02.independent.ie/incoming/article38305245.ece/f99d5/AUTOCROP/w65square/ipanews_6fbb6131-51f4-4c99-85da-bc62f9a08b59_1",
