(1) Yes, she has undergone a procedure before. (2) Obviously, not everywhere.\n\nTo be fair, I totally would.\n\nThis story was originally posted on May 5, 2017 at 4:00 P.M.\n\nChrissy Teigen, my personal hero and yours, is many things\u2014a voice for all the unrealistic B.S. expected of women, especially new moms, a fantastic cook, a queller of Twitter trolls\u2014but one thing she isn't is fake. At least in the sense of telling things like they are, whether that's about stretch marks, postpartum depression, or plastic surgery. And that's why her latest admission making headlines falls in the category of \"stuff Chrissy keeps it real about.\"\n\nAt an event for her new Becca highlighter palette, the model told a room full of writers that people always ask her about her cheeks and whether or not they're real, Byrdie reports. Guess what? They're all hers. But she followed up with this: \"Everything about me is fake except my cheeks,\" she said, laughing and pointing to her forehead, nose, and lips. \"Fake, fake, fake.\"\n\nWith her usual refreshing candor, Teigen went on to explain why she's happy with her decision to get treatments done\u2014a friendly reminder that celebrities are humans with insecurities too. \"I had my armpit sucked out,\" she said, noting that the liposuction procedure wasn't exactly necessary but that it made her feel better. \"It added two inches of length to my arms. [That fat] is coming back though, so I might need to go in and pay for it again.\" To put it in better context, she said that last line while laughing.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d0a87ff4ba70452f1ceade8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1035137022.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/585e9a0e99e7331b15988777/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-gift.jpg", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5cfe874744dce7c7eaaeebee/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d01120465bc2a0537062875/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-919968920.jpg", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d0e7b89415015592472155a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kim-khloe-karashian.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/588fccb16104cb61390d7b4e/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/CHRISSY%252520TEIGEN.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1489791396/glamour_chrissy-teigen-takes-us-behind-the-scenes-of-her-favorite-instagram-shots.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/585e9a0e99e7331b15988777/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-gift.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Julyssa Lopez", "Anna Moeslein", "Lindsay Schallo", "Natasha Reda", "Samantha Leach"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-everything-about-me-is-fake-except-my-cheeks", "title": "Chrissy Teigen on Plastic Surgery: &quot;Everything About Me Is Fake Except My Cheeks&quot;", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Chrissy Teigen opened up about the plastic surgery she's gotten on her face during an event for Becca Cosmetics.", "keywords": "chrissy teigen,plastic surgery", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "\"Everything about me is fake except my cheeks.\"", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/585e9a0e99e7331b15988777/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-gift.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Just Broke the Curse of Plastic Surgery-Denying Stars", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-everything-about-me-is-fake-except-my-cheeks"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"Everything about me is fake except my cheeks.\"", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/585e9a0e99e7331b15988777/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-gift.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Just Broke the Curse of Plastic Surgery-Denying Stars"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
