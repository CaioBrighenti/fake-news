(Finally!)\n\nThe actress posted a simple Instagram photo that reads: \"10-2-18\" on top of a pink background. \"She\u2019s here \ud83d\udc95\" Kate shared in the caption.\n\nKate, 38, also wrote that she and boyfriend Danny Fujikawa decided to name their daughter Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa. (It's their first baby together, btw!)\n\n\u201cWe have decided to name our daughter Rani (pronounced Ronnie) after her grandfather, Ron Fujikawa. Ron was the most special man who we all miss dearly. To name her after him is an honor,\u201d Kate wrote in her announcement post.\n\nShe added: \u201cEveryone is doing well and happy as can be. Our family thanks you for all the love and blessings that have been sent our way and we send ours right back.\u201d\n\nKate and Danny made their red carpet debut in May 2017 at the premiere of Snatched in LA, where they kissed and posed for photos together. \u201cMy cute man. He\u2019s the best!\u201d she told Extra at the premiere. And, when she was asked what she loves most about him, she said, \u201cHow long do you have? He\u2019s a good man.\u201d\n\nKate and Danny have kept their relationship pretty low-key, but there are a few things we do know about them:\n\nThey knew each other years before dating.\n\nKate said in an Instagram post in December 2017 that she first met Danny when she was 23 and pregnant with her son, Ryder. Danny's step-sisters are Kate\u2019s best friends, she says, so they\u2019ve been in the same circles for years.\n\n\u201cA year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date,\u201d Kate wrote in her Instagram caption. \u201cNo moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter. So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it\u2019s been truly incredible!\u201d\n\nThey went public in May 2017.\n\nKate and Danny made their red carpet debut as a couple at the premier of the movie Snatched, which stars Kate's mom Goldie Hawn, reports People.\n\nBut rumors about their relationship started popping up in March of the same year, since the couple was spotted kissing during a lunch date in Los Angeles, according to People.\n\nDanny is a musician.\n\nDanny is another musician\u2014like Kate\u2019s former husband Chris Robinson and ex Matt Bellamy. Danny is the former singer and guitarist for the band Chief.\n\nHe also owns the record label Lightwave Records, which he started in 2013 with The Delta Mirror frontman Chris Acosta, according to the label\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\n\nDanny clearly has a great sense of humor.\n\nKate's boo seems like a pretty hilarious guy. He regularly posts pics on Instagram of himself doing funny things like posing in a sheet mask and \u201ccrying\u201d after he shaved off his long beard.\n\nThey've traveled the world together.\n\nAs for what Kate and Danny have been up to lately (besides, you know), the details are pretty scarce. The couple went to Cambodia last summer, according to Danny's Instagram. Kate also posted a pic on Instagram of the two of them skiing to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nWhile Kate was six months pregnant with Rani, the couple even took a \"babymoon\" trip and traveled through Italy, with friends and family.\n\nThey announced Kate's pregnancy in the cutest (and realest) way.\n\nKate and her honey first announced they were expecting a baby girl together back in April with an Instagram video. The post showed the couple\u2014along with Kate's sons Ryder (from her former marriage with Chris Robinson) and Bingham (from her former relationship with Matt Bellamy)\u2014popping four huge balloons that contained pink confetti. (Cue everyone screaming.)\n\n\u201cSURPRISE!!! If you\u2019ve wondered why I\u2019ve been so absent on my social channels it\u2019s because I have never been more sick!\u201d Kate wrote in the caption. \u201c[It] was the most sick first trimester of all my children. Boomerangs have made me nauseous, Superzoom is an easy way to have my head in the toilet, food Instagrams make me [queasy] and thinking too much about Insta stories made me even more exhausted than I already had been.\u201d\n\nHe fits in perfectly with Kate's family.\n\nFollowing the actress's birthday, Kate posted this cute pic with Danny, along with the caption: \"#tbt To my favorite birthday moment. You can\u2019t really see my kiddos in the front but I was getting love from all my boys at once. #FeelingLucky\"\n\nKate says he's the love of her life.\n\nKate posted a happy 32nd birthday wish to her man on Instagram on Sunday with the note: \"06-10-86 Happy birthday baby \u2764\ufe0f.\" She included a pic of the couple kissing in a woodsy setting with the hashtag #LoveOfMyLife.\n\nThey were both very excited for Rani's arrival.\n\nKate told People that she \"[looks] forward to having feminine energy\" around.\n\nAnd her brothers Oliver Hudson and Wyatt Russell confirmed both she and Danny were very excited about their daughter on the way.\n\n\u201cI was teary-eyed because I know how badly she wanted a girl,\u201d he told PEOPLE in April. \u201cI know Danny, I\u2019m sure in some part of every man\u2019s brain you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019d love to have a little me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWyatt added: \u201cBut when he met my brother\u2019s little girl Rio, who\u2019s the cutest thing in the entire world, she made him be like, \u2018Okay, I want a girl.\u2019 So they\u2019re really excited.\u201d\n\nKate went into full-blown nesting mode.\n\nIn Kate's Instagram story at the end of September, Kate posted a series of photos that revealed she and Danny were prepping their baby's nursery as they eagerly awaited her arrival.\n\nThe story pics included a poll about wallpaper, a photo of the bassinet they chose for the room, and finally a photo of Danny wearing a baby carrier with the caption \"I think someone's ready to go!\"\n\nThey (allegedly) didn't pick her name out until the last minute.\n\nThe actress appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show at the end of September along with her mom, Goldie Hawn.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say you\u2019ve probably never had anyone this pregnant on your show,\u201d the actress told Ellen. \u201c[My] water could go any second.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the show, Kate admitted that she and Danny had yet to pick out a name for their daughter-to-be. \"We have a couple of them and we\u2019re going to decide when the day comes,\u201d she revealed.\n\nLooks like they picked a good one.
