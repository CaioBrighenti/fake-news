He was making me cry.\"\n\nIn fact, Kardashian said Odom told her he would \"kill\" for her family and that he loves the Kardashians.\n\n\"It's so sad to sit back and watch somebody's life implode right before your very eyes,\" Kris Jenner said about Odom and the situation with her daughter. \"Six months ago she had a husband and a family and a bond that I thought would be unbreakable.\"\n\nRead: Khloe Kardashian Says 'I'm a Shattered Person' on 'KUWTK'\n\nKhloe Kardashian, 29, was not happy about her father-in-law's comments.\n\n\"People want to point the finger, but we have nothing to do with anything that's going on,\" she said of Odom's alleged drug use and infidelity. \"If anything, we've been a support system. Take me through the mud, but please don't drag my family through it.\"\n\nIn another apologetic call, Khloe's sister Kourtney Kardashian spoke to Odom about their relationship and said: \"We love you and we're here for you. I just want to do whatever I can.\"\n\nOdom went as far as to send Khloe's other sister Kim Kardashian his statement about his father's comments he was about to release, which he eventually tweeted Sept. 24.\n\nRelated: Khloe Kardashian Files For Divorce\n\n\"My heart breaks for Khlo\u00e9,\" Kim said. \"I feel like she's in such a place where she just is kind of stuck and I understand now why she's made so many of the choices that she's made, but now that she has endured so much I just really want her to figure out what she's going to do next.\"\n\nAfter all this, Odom tried desperately to see his estranged wife.\n\n\"I'll see you tonight,\" he said. \"I'll bring dinner tonight with champagne.\"\n\nIt's also revealed he stopped by at 1 a.m. and that Khloe didn't want him at the house.\n\n\"I miss you too but I can't see you,\" she told him. \"It's just so confusing.\"\n\nLater Khloe said, \"I wake up and sometimes I'm in a great mood and sometimes I'm really angry and confused and irritated at life. I just have to take it day by day.\"", "images": ["http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Lifestyle/GTY_khloe_lamar_kab_140121_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Lifestyle/GTY_khloe_lamar_kab_140121_33x16_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Lifestyle/GTY_khloe_lamar_kab_140121_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Michael Rothman"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/khloe-kardashian-im-angry-confused-irritated-life/story?id=21610067", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: 'I'm Really Angry and Confused and Irritated at Life'", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "khloe kardashian,entertainment news, celebrity news, celebrity gossip", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Khloe Kardashian: 'I'm Really Angry and Confused and Irritated at Life'", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: 'I'm Really Angry and Confused and Irritated at Life'", "description": "\"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" continued it's two-night season premiere Monday and further dived into what Khloe Kardashian went through before she decided to divorce Lamar Odom last month.\nThe episode, filmed at least a month prior to her filing for divorce on Dec. 13, shows Odom calling...", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/khloe-kardashian-im-angry-confused-irritated-life/story?id=21610067", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Lifestyle/GTY_khloe_lamar_kab_140121_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "khloe kardashian", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "@TheRealRothman", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: 'I'm Really Angry and Confused and Irritated at Life'", "description": "\"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" continued it's two-night season premiere Monday and further dived into what Khloe Kardashian went through before she decided to divorce Lamar Odom last month.\nThe episode, filmed at least a month prior to her filing for divorce on Dec. 13, shows Odom calling...", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/khloe-kardashian-im-angry-confused-irritated-life/story?id=21610067", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Lifestyle/GTY_khloe_lamar_kab_140121_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,21610067", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,21610067", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/khloe-kardashian-im-angry-confused-irritated-life/story?id=21610067"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,21610067", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,21610067", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/khloe-kardashian-im-angry-confused-irritated-life/story?id=21610067", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/khloe-kardashian-im-angry-confused-irritated-life/story?id=21610067"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
