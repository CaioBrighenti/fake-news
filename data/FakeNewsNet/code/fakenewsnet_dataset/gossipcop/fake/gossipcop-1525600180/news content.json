Previously, on Sept. 7, Mexico City was hit by an 8.1-magnitude earthquake.\n\nAs of Wednesday (Sept. 20) morning, 217 people have been confirmed dead with several others injured. According to The New York Times, \"The earthquake happened on the 32nd anniversary of a devastating 1985 quake that killed as many as 10,000 people and flattened 400 buildings in Mexico City. That quake led to a tougher new construction code in the capital.\"\n\nAs did millions, artists took to Twitter and Instagram to express grief and prayers toward those in Mexico City.
