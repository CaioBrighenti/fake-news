The model wrote,\n\n\u201cHow did this get approved by an entire marketing team? Why is okay to tell young kids being fat = ugly?\u201d\n\nHolliday also tagged the film\u2019s star, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, asking her to comment on the advertisement. Dozens of Twitter users did the same, understandably disgusted by the body-shaming poster.\n\nNow, Moretz has finally chimed in on the controversy. In a series of tweets, the 20-year-old actress said she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the ad, and it hadn\u2019t been approved by her or her team.\n\nThe actress wrote,\n\n\u201cI have now fully reviewed the [marketing] for Red Shoes, I am just as appalled and angry as everyone else, this wasn\u2019t approved by me or my team. Pls know I have let the producers of the film know. I lent my voice to a beautiful script that I hope you will all see in its entirety. The actual story is powerful for young women and resonated with me. I am sorry for the offense that was beyond my creative control.\u201d\n\nIronically, the film is about celebrating yourself for who you are.
