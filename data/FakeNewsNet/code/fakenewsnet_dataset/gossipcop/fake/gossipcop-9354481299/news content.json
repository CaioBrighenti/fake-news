{"url": "www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/09/aniston200509", "text": "Aniston\u2019s response has been to retreat into her cocoon, \u201cin an effort to take care of myself and my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m nesting. I love being home. I have friends that come over. My girlfriends I\u2019ve had for 20 years. When things happen, the tribe gathers around and lifts you up. I\u2019ve had lonely moments, sure, but I\u2019m also enjoying being alone. There\u2019s no question it takes getting used to; I\u2019m a partnership person, and if something happens your instinct is to share it\u2014but you\u2019re no longer part of a couple. I definitely miss that. It\u2019s sort of like Bambi\u2014like you\u2019re trying to learn how to walk. You\u2019re a little awkward; you stumble a little bit. The things you would do with your partner, you don\u2019t do. It\u2019s uncharted territory, but I think it\u2019s good for me to be a solo person right now. You\u2019re forced to re-discover yourself and take it to another level. If you can find a way to see the glass half full, these are the moments when you learn the most. I\u2019ve had to re-introduce myself to myself in a way that\u2019s different.\u201d She doesn\u2019t downplay the difficulties. \u201cAm I lonely? Yes. Am I upset? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. Do I have my days when I\u2019ve thrown a little pity party for myself? Absolutely. But I\u2019m also doing really well,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got an unbelievable support team, and I\u2019m a tough cookie.\u2026 I believe in therapy; I think it\u2019s an incredible tool in educating the self on the self. I feel very strong. I\u2019m really proud of how I\u2019ve conducted myself.\u201d A crucial part of Aniston\u2019s strategy has been to ignore the putrid stew of rumor, speculation, and outright falsehood in the tabloid media. \u201cIt\u2019s been very important for me not to read anything, not to see anything,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been my saving grace. That stuff is just toxic for me right now. I probably avoided a lot of suffering by not engaging in it, not reading, not watching.\u201d She gestures toward Norman, who has roused himself for a moment to check on his mistress\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cIt\u2019s like those dog cones,\u201d she says, encircling her neck as if putting on one of the plastic cones prescribed by vets to prevent dogs from scratching their ears. \u201cI have my imaginary dog cone on, so I don\u2019t see anything. It just allows for a much more peaceful life.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, as Pitt publicly flaunted the instant family he had created with Jolie, the tableaux of their newfound togetherness were humiliating. \u201cI would be a robot if I said I didn\u2019t feel moments of anger, of hurt, of embarrassment,\u201d Aniston acknowledges. But she tries to keep the lurid details to herself. \u201cShe is grieving, but she\u2019s taken the high road,\u201d says Bendewald. \u201cShe\u2019s mourning the death of a marriage, and she\u2019s done it very privately. She can have her moments of rage, but she doesn\u2019t want to out him, and that keeps her heart clear. She\u2019s not bad-mouthing him. She doesn\u2019t want to make him the villain and her the victim.\u201d Indeed, Aniston vehemently rejects the interpretation that she was left for another woman. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a victim,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with this therapist for a long time, and her major focus is that you get one day of being a victim\u2014and that\u2019s it. Then we take responsibility for our own input. To live in a victim place is pointing a finger at someone else, as if you have no control. Relationships are two people; everyone is accountable. A lot goes into a relationship coming together, and a lot goes into a relationship falling apart. She\u2019d say, \u2018Even if it\u2019s 98 percent the other person\u2019s fault, it\u2019s 2 percent yours, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on.\u2019 You can only clean up your side of the street.\u201d These days, one index of recovery is the fact that Aniston\u2019s sardonic humor is resurfacing. When I tell her that my 13-year-old son is a big fan of hers, she doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cIs he single?\u201d she asks, deadpan. She\u2019ll toss off a crack about Pitt\u2019s startling transformation into a punky bleached blond. \u201cBilly Idol called\u2014he wants his look back,\u201d she murmurs with a sly smile. By now she can even talk about those gut-wrenching photos of Jolie and Pitt in Kenya with mordant resignation rather than tears. \u201cI can\u2019t say it was one of the highlights of my year,\u201d she says. \u201cWho would deal with that and say, \u2018Isn\u2019t that sweet! That looks like fun!\u2019? But shit happens. You joke and say, \u2018What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u2019\u201d She sighs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve earned a superpower shield,\u201d she says. Then, afraid of sounding grandiose, she adds, \u201cI\u2019m not comparing my suffering to other people\u2019s suffering. Everybody has their own.\u201d\n\nAniston\u2019s friends were particularly horrified by W magazine\u2019s 60-page photo spread featuring Pitt and Jolie as an early-1960s-style married couple with a brood of miniature blond Brads. \u201cYou want to shake the shit out of him and say, \u2018Your timing sucks!\u2019\u201d says one. \u201cHe\u2019s made some choices that have been tremendously insensitive.\u201d The W feature, which was entitled \u201cDomestic Bliss,\u201d couldn\u2019t be blamed on the paparazzi; not only did Pitt conceptualize it, but he retained the international rights, so he actually profited from it. Aniston\u2019s eyes widen in surprise when I mention that last fact, and she grimaces. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d she says. But she refuses to indulge herself in an angry reaction. \u201cIs it odd timing? Yeah. But it\u2019s not my life,\u201d she says. \u201cHe makes his choices. He can do\u2014whatever. We\u2019re divorced, and you can see why.\u201d She shakes her head in exasperation. \u201cI can also imagine Brad having absolutely no clue why people would be appalled by it,\u201d she adds. \u201cBrad is not mean-spirited; he would never intentionally try to rub something in my face. In hindsight, I can see him going, \u2018Oh\u2014I can see that that was inconsiderate.\u2019 But I know Brad. Brad would say, \u2018That\u2019s art!\u2019\u201d She rolls her eyes, pretending to screw something into her forehead. \u201cThere\u2019s a sensitivity chip that\u2019s missing,\u201d she says. Aniston\u2019s friends are amazed at her willingness to give Pitt the benefit of the doubt, but they basically agree with her assessment. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was trying to hurt Jen,\u201d says Courteney Cox, Aniston\u2019s dear friend and former co-star on Friends. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Brad is malicious, or a liar. The W thing was his idea, but I don\u2019t think he thought that one through, about what it would look like to anyone else.\u201d Although Aniston remains determined not to lash out, she sometimes questions her own restraint. \u201cWhy am I protecting him?\u201d she exclaimed to one friend, only to continue with what she sees as the dignified course of action. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in taking public potshots,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not my concern anymore. What happened to him after the separation\u2014it\u2019s his life now. I\u2019ve made a conscious effort not to add to the toxicity of this situation. I haven\u2019t retaliated. I don\u2019t want to be a part of it. I don\u2019t have a halo that I\u2019m polishing here; everyone has their personal thoughts. But I would much rather everyone move on. I am not defined by this relationship. I am not defined by the part they\u2019re making me play in the triangle. It\u2019s maddening to me. But I had a mom who was very angry about her divorce, and made shots, and I don\u2019t want to play that out. If people are frustrated that I don\u2019t want to do that, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m figuring this out as I go along. This is my first time at this particular picnic.\u201d\n\nAs befits a storybook tale, the Pitts\u2019 marriage was the first for both of them, and some of Aniston\u2019s fondest memories are from the time they shared before the world discovered their romance. \u201cWe had so much fun falling in love,\u201d she says wistfully. \u201cIt was so private; we kept it to ourselves for so long. It was something we were really proud of.\u201d But after the relationship became public, it was always difficult to reconcile their mythic image with the quotidian reality of their private life, which was more likely to involve watching television, ordering takeout, and having close friends over than swanning around on red carpets. Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. \u201cWe were put on a pedestal, but we were just a couple like anybody else,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cWhen we were home, we\u2019d watch the shows we loved, and one time there was this program called It\u2019s Good to Be Brad and Jen. It was all about us going to Scotland and Greece and having our matching S.U.V.\u2019s, and it wasn\u2019t my life\u2014I\u2019d never even been to some of these places, but even I got sucked in. We\u2019re sitting there saying, \u2018Yeah, boy, it sure must be good to be Brad and Jen!\u2019 So is it our responsibility to demystify this, to say, \u2018This is not what it\u2019s like\u2014it\u2019s not that fabulous, not that great\u2019? There\u2019s no doubt our life is fortunate, but \u2026 \u201c But even golden couples struggle with the formidable challenges of marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s like the ebb and flow of every relationship,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard; it gets easy; it gets fun again. What\u2019s hard to sustain is some ideal that it\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s ridiculous. What\u2019s fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person, and looking across the room and saying, \u2018I\u2019m still here. And I still love you.\u2019 You re-meet, reconnect. You have marriages within marriages within marriages. That\u2019s what I love about marriage. That\u2019s what I want in marriage. It\u2019s unfortunate, but we live in a very disposable society. Those moments where it looks like \u2018Uh-oh, this isn\u2019t working!\u2019\u2014those are the most important, transformative moments. Most couples draw up divorce papers when they\u2019re missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection.\u201d She sighs heavily and turns away to light a Merit cigarette. \u201cThat\u2019s not Brad\u2019s view of it,\u201d she says, glum again. \u201cWe believe in different things, I guess. You can\u2019t force a relationship, even if it\u2019s your view of how you would like it to be conducted. Obviously two people leave a relationship because there\u2019s a different thought pattern happening. My goal is to try and achieve a very deep, committed relationship. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in, but it\u2019s someone\u2019s prerogative to be or not to be in or out of a relationship.\u201d \u201cI think Jen wanted to work it out, and I don\u2019t think he wanted to work it out,\u201d Andrea Bendewald observes. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knew what he wanted.\u201d Nevertheless, Aniston has only kind words about her marriage. \u201cI still feel so lucky to have experienced it. I wouldn\u2019t know what I know now if I hadn\u2019t been married to Brad,\u201d she says. \u201cI love Brad; I really love him. I will love him for the rest of my life. He\u2019s a fantastic man. I don\u2019t regret any of it, and I\u2019m not going to beat myself up about it. We spent seven very intense years together; we taught each other a lot\u2014about healing, and about fun. We helped each other through a lot, and I really value that. It was a beautiful, complicated relationship. The sad thing, for me, is the way it\u2019s been reduced to a Hollywood clich\u00e9\u2014or maybe it\u2019s just a human clich\u00e9. I have a lot of compassion for everyone going through this.\u201d\n\nAs for what went wrong, Aniston rejects any simplistic explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s just complicated,\u201d she says. \u201cRelationships are complicated, whether they\u2019re friendships or business relationships or parent relationships. I don\u2019t think anybody in a marriage gets to a point where they feel like \u2018We\u2019ve got it!\u2019 You\u2019re two people continually evolving, and there will be times when those changes clash. There are all these levels of growth\u2014and when you stop growing together, that\u2019s when the problems happen.\u201d Friends say that it was always difficult for Aniston and Pitt to maintain the intimacy they craved while juggling their demanding work schedules, which often required long separations. Those tensions notwithstanding, Aniston believed her marriage was the real thing. \u201cWe both did,\u201d she says. So what happened? \u201cI think\u2014it changed,\u201d she says haltingly. \u201cWe both changed.\u201d She sighs again. \u201cYou do the best you can, and I think we did. We did the best we could.\u201d Both of them? She looks me straight in the eye. \u201cBoth parties,\u201d she says. But nagging questions remain about Pitt\u2019s conduct during the months leading up to their separation. \u201cShe was committed to the marriage,\u201d says Bendewald. \u201cHe wanted to figure out who he was and what he wanted, but he seemed to want to do it without being married. She wanted him to figure out what he wanted and stay married. He didn\u2019t think he could do that, so at that point she was like, \u2018O.K., go figure it out.\u2019\u201d Throughout that period, Pitt insisted that his relationship with Jolie was not the cause of his marital discontent, but his actions since the separation have suggested otherwise. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Aniston admits. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t understand, a lot I don\u2019t know, and probably never will know, really. So I choose to take away with me as much integrity and dignity and respect for what that relationship was as I can. I feel as if I\u2019m trying to scrounge around and pick up the pieces in the midst of this media circus.\u201d Does she buy Brad\u2019s claim that he didn\u2019t cheat on her before they separated? \u201cI choose to believe my husband,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cAt this point, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised by anything, but I would much rather choose to believe him.\u201d\n\nTheir friends are still trying to parse what happened with Jolie. \u201cI don\u2019t think he started an affair physically, but I think he was attracted to her,\u201d says Courteney Cox, who vacationed with her husband, David Arquette, and the Pitts on Anguilla just before they announced their separation. \u201cThere was a connection, and he was honest about that with Jen. Most of the time, when people are attracted to other people, they don\u2019t tell. At least he was honest about it. It was an attraction that he fought for a period of time.\u201d He may have been fighting it, but Pitt virtually checked out of his marriage as soon as he began working with Jolie, according to Aniston\u2019s intimates. \u201cHe was gone,\u201d says one. Aniston has met Jolie only once, when she took a passing opportunity to say hello. \u201cIt was on the lot of Friends\u2014I pulled over and introduced myself,\u201d Aniston recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018Brad is so excited about working with you. I hope you guys have a really good time.\u2019\u201d But he soon became emotionally unavailable to his wife, at a time when she needed him desperately. Pitt\u2019s withdrawal coincided with the end of Friends, which Aniston experienced as a huge loss. \u201cThat was really painful. It was a family, and I don\u2019t do great with families splitting up,\u201d says Aniston, who was deeply wounded by her parents\u2019 bitter divorce, which happened when she was 9. \u201cIt was hard to have such a wonderful constant in your life, a place to go every day, and then all of a sudden it\u2019s not there.\u201d When she reached out for her husband\u2019s support, she didn\u2019t get it. \u201cHe just wasn\u2019t there for me,\u201d she says. To the amazement of Aniston\u2019s friends, Pitt didn\u2019t even show up for the final taping of Friends. \u201cHe was working,\u201d she says, still defending him, even though movie stars have been known to request changes in a shooting schedule to accommodate events that are important to them.\n\nAlthough she isn\u2019t talking to Pitt these days, Aniston remains in regular contact with his mother, whom she loves dearly, and she doesn\u2019t rule out a better relationship with Brad in the future. \u201cI really do hope that someday we can be friends again,\u201d she says. She certainly doesn\u2019t regret her four-and-a-half-year marriage\u2014not even the million-dollar wedding with 50,000 flowers, a 40-member gospel choir, a Greek bouzouki band, and fireworks exploding over the Pacific. (\u201cIt was fantastic!\u201d she says.) But she does have other regrets. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I would probably do differently,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d take more vacations\u2014getting away from work, enjoying each other in different environments. But there was always something preventing it; either he was working or I was.\u201d She made more profound mistakes as well. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give over so much of myself, which I did at times,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt was that thing about being a nurturer; I love taking care of people, and I definitely put his needs before mine sometimes. It\u2019s seamless; somewhere along the way, you sort of lose yourself. You just don\u2019t know when it happens. It\u2019s such an insidious thing, you don\u2019t really see where it started\u2014and where you ended. There\u2019s no one to blame but yourself. I\u2019ve always been that way in relationships, even with my mom. It\u2019s not the healthiest. I feel like I\u2019ve broken the pattern now. I\u2019ll never let myself down like that again. I feel like my sense of self is being strengthened because of it.\u201d Aniston\u2019s unhappy family history colored her experience of marriage from the outset. \u201cI come from a fighting family, and I had a tough time arguing,\u201d she says. \u201cFighting scared me. I wouldn\u2019t speak up for myself. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned; I will always speak my mind.\u201d In recent months, the process of healing from the breakup with Brad has also created a new openness to healing relations with her mother. Their estrangement began nearly a decade ago, when Nancy Aniston gossiped about Jennifer on a television show, and worsened when she tried to cash in on Jennifer\u2019s fame by writing an appalling book called From Mother and Daughter to Friends. Jennifer severed all contact, but she is now re-assessing their relationship. \u201cWe\u2019ve exchanged messages,\u201d she says. \u201cOur doors are open. We\u2019re taking baby steps. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Although Aniston incurred criticism for distancing herself from her mother, who did not attend her wedding, she offers no apologies. \u201cI feel pretty good about the choices I\u2019ve made. The choice of not speaking to Mom for a while\u2014that\u2019s ours. Nobody else has to understand it. The same thing with Brad and myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change my childhood, I wouldn\u2019t change my heartaches, I wouldn\u2019t change my successes. I wouldn\u2019t change any of it, because I really love who I am, and am continuing to become. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s all in the past,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t kill you. You move on. You can\u2019t let the devastation of a divorce take over and win\u2014let it make you this bitter, closed-off, angry, skeptical person. Then you\u2019re just falling victim to it. You don\u2019t want to shut your heart down. You don\u2019t want to feel that when a marriage ends, your life is over. You can survive anything. Compared to what other people are surviving out there in the world, this is not so bad, in the grand scheme of things. Human endurance is unbelievable. Think of what mothers of soldiers have to rise above! Everything\u2019s relative.\u201d She looks down at her firm, fit body. \u201cNothing\u2019s broke,\u201d she says. Catching the quizzical look on my face, she concedes, \u201cMaybe a little bruised.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, on a stiflingly hot day in Chicago, Aniston and I are sitting in her hotel suite looking out on Lake Michigan, which is studded with little white boats. I\u2019ve just told her about the gossip magazine that says she\u2019s registered here as \u201cMrs. Smith.\u201d The report claims Aniston is taking perverse pleasure in making hotel staffers address her as Mrs. Smith, even though they know perfectly well who she is. The only problem with this amusing tidbit is that it\u2019s not true. \u201cI wish I\u2019d thought of it,\u201d says Aniston, who is registered under an entirely different, although equally humorous, name. Despite her vow of abstinence, she succumbed to a celebrity magazine the other evening\u2014and immediately regretted it. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve fallen off the wagon,\u201d she moans. Unfortunately, the first publication she picked up featured an insult from Kimberly Stewart, Rod\u2019s party-girl daughter. \u201cShe said I\u2019m homely,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cIt literally ruined my night. I got my feelings very hurt, actually. That was my instant Karma.\u201d She has always fretted about her appearance, although that is often hard for others to believe. Posing for her Vanity Fair cover shoot, Aniston was equally fetching in French-dance-hall-girl black stockings and in a half-open oversize shirt that evoked every man\u2019s favorite just-rolled-out-of-bed look. With her tousled hair, cobalt-blue eyes, and dazzling smile, she seemed the ultimate adorable sexpot. Far from pining away in seclusion, she appeared to be sending a far more spirited message\u2014like \u201cEat your heart out, Brad!\u201d Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. But Aniston has never been able to reconcile the glamorous Jen on page or screen with the self-doubting woman she sees in the mirror, and the current tabloid coverage has exacerbated that gap. \u201cIt\u2019s literally two different people\u2014the real me, and the \u2018Jen\u2019 they write about, \u2018fighting back,\u2019 \u2018getting revenge\u2019\u2014everything I couldn\u2019t be farther from wanting to do,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I\u2019m back on the wagon.\u201d When she arrived in Chicago to film The Break-Up, the gossip media, frantic for a new development, immediately plunged her into a torrid romance with her co-star, Vince Vaughn. This affair apparently does not exist. \u201cI adore Vince Vaughn, but I\u2019m not going out with Vince Vaughn,\u201d she says. \u201cI barely know the guy. We\u2019ve exchanged a wine-and-cheese basket for the start of the movie, and we\u2019ve gone out to dinner with the director and other people. We\u2019ve got to get to know each other.\u201d But is Aniston seeing him\u2014or anyone else? \u201cNobody,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cI like a lot of people, but I am sooo not \u2018in like\u2019 with anybody. I am really enjoying being by myself. I\u2019m excited that I know there\u2019s somebody out there for me, but I am absolutely in no rush. This is all very fresh, very new. This was a seven-year relationship that was very dear, very complicated, very special. I need to honor it.\u201d\n\nAside from her initial flurry of tears, Aniston remains calm and thoughtful through hours of conversation with me over the course of several weeks. But there is one final topic to be addressed, and it\u2019s the most hurtful of all. The rumor that Jolie is pregnant with Pitt\u2019s child has swept around the world; some reports even have her finishing her first trimester. When I ask Aniston about that, she looks as if I\u2019ve stabbed her in the heart. Her eyes well up and spill over. Several long minutes go by as the tears keep rolling down her cheeks; she bites her lip, seemingly unable to speak.
