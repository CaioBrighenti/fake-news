This is a photo of an oversize suitcase, and people think glossy pop icon goddess Taylor Swift could be inside. That is, if you believe the caption that was posted to a paparazzi photo database (which was first spotted by radio station Spin1038). \"Taylor Swift being transported in a huge suitcase from her Tribeca apartment...almost a dozen of Taylor Swift['s] security guards were present to move this package carefully as Taylor Swift remains to be unseen for a long time,\" it reads.\n\nCheck it out for yourself, below:\n\nAs you'd expect, people on Twitter have been rejoicing over this news. But whether or not this story is true, it does hilariously highlight how weird it is to be a celebrity. I mean, we live in a world where they sell their used tissues on eBay for $5,000. And straight-up stop government elections because of their concerts. Hell, they put leeches on their bodies \u2014 for health reasons! So it's not that surprising that your favorite stars occasionally travel in unconventional ways, like private planes, tour buses, and...getting stuffed into suitcases.\n\nIs traveling in a suitcase strange? Sure. Unabashedly extra? Absolutely. The opening scene of a future T. Swift music video called \"My Love Is in a Suitcase?\" Probably. But it's actually not that far-fetched: After all, Adele was frequently wheeled to the stage in an equipment box on her last tour. Lady Gaga arrived to the 2011 Grammy Awards in a giant egg. Sometimes the outside world is just too hard, and the only way to escape is by hopping into a box.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/596cebf408b17d5517ae32e4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-suitcase.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d0912c0a0533b7c440cff26/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-beyonce.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/596ceaf23e140d377babba9f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-GETTY.jpg", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1a57424db38c000874b783/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-scooter.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1499294085/glamour_women-answer-what-makes-good-dirty-talk.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d01619edac63f955391056f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/MEGHAN-MARKLE-PRINCE-.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/596cebec3e140d377babbaa1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/CAPTION.png", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/596ceaf23e140d377babba9f/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-GETTY.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d052e7c0cd0cf4c6ee296a6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-133627811.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/596ceaf23e140d377babba9f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-GETTY.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Anna Moeslein", "Christopher Rosa", "Christopher Ros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-carried-out-of-her-apartment-in-a-huge-suitcase", "title": "Was Taylor Swift Carried Out of Her Apartment in a Huge Suitcase?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "In weird celebrity news, Taylor Swift was allegedly carried out of her New York City apartment in a huge suitcase.
