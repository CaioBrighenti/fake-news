The court papers obtained by PEOPLE stated, \u201cthe children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,\u201d and that Jolie, 43, could lose full custody of the kids if she doesn\u2019t allow them to grow their relationships with Pitt.\n\nMaddox, 16, his oldest son isn\u2019t included in the timetable. That\u2019s because according to the court, Maddox is old enough to decide for himself how much time he wants to spend with his father.\n\nImage zoom Pitt with Pax, Shiloh and Maddox (from left) in 2014. Gregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\n\u201cHe is a great dad and always loved being with his kids,\u201d a Pitt source says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk badly about Angie, but he feels it\u2019s her fault that the kids don\u2019t want to spend more time with him.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Angelina Jolie Could Lose Primary Custody of Kids If Brad Pitt Isn\u2019t Allowed Access: Report\n\nPitt has been in the U.K. since last week, when he was seen on Wednesday riding his bike across the Coworth Park hotel property, only a few miles from where Jolie and the kids stay in England.\n\nWhen filming starts on his next movie, Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, later this summer, Pitt will balance his time between London and Los Angeles, where he maintains a \u201cvery busy schedule,\u201d the insider says. \u201cHe often attends dinner parties, socializes with friends and attends events.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Getty (2)\n\nFor last year\u2019s Father\u2019s Day, Pitt celebrated one day early. Several of the kids were seen being dropped off at the Okja executive producer\u2019s Los Angeles house in the morning, before flying out to France with their mom later that day.", "images":
