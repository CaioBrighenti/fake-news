The studio has always been my safe haven. But the ultimate goal for me is to be satisfied. I never want to be a figure of disappointment. The best quote to sum \u2018I\u2019ve never felt as though I didn\u2019t belong, I just acted as though I did.\u2019 \u2014Boy George.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Aaron Carter Says Medical Condition Is Keeping Him Skinny\n\nIt\u2019s been a dramatic summer for Carter. He was arrested on July 15 on suspicion of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana. He denies that he was under the influence while driving, claiming that he was experiencing car troubles. His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was with him that night and was also arrested.\n\nIn June, Carter was briefly hospitalized for exhaustion and spoke out against critics who had been body-shaming his thin frame, which he says is the result of a hiatal hernia that he was diagnosed with when he was 19.", "images":
