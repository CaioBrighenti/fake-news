Singer Jennifer Hudson replaced her at the event.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Gwen Stefani on Her Year of \u2018Beautiful Memories\u2019 with Blake Shelton\n\nAccording to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, manager Irving Azoff told Ruvo that Stefani was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Tuesday, and advised not to fly or sing.
