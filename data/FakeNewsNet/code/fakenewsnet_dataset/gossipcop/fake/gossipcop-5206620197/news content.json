Khloe broke down and has been leaning on him ever since.\n\n\u201cKhloe FaceTimes Lamar and they\u2019ll often speak for hours,\u201d they continued. \u201cShe says it\u2019s the most comfort she\u2019s had since the scandal broke.\u201d\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians married former basketball player Lamar in a lavish, televised wedding in September 2009, but the pair filed for divorce just four years later following his alleged cheating and drug relapse.\n\nThey signed divorce papers in July 2015, but proceedings were halted following Lamar\u2019s near-fatal overdose that October, and not finalised until December 2016.\n\n\u201cKhloe\u2019s been craving the familiarity she had with Lamar,\u201d the source added. \u201cTristan is trying to win her back, but she\u2019s unsure if she can trust him. She loves him and wants to make it work for True\u2019s sake, but she\u2019s confused.\u201d\n\nThe Good American denim mogul has kept a low profile since the birth of her first child, with one report claiming that while she wants to give things with Tristan another chance, the 33-year-old would feel more secure if the couple married.\n\n\u201cKhloe is so humiliated after the cheating revelations, she feels that if she got a ring on his finger, it would help show that she\u2019s the girl Tristan chose to marry,\u201d the insider claimed.", "images":
