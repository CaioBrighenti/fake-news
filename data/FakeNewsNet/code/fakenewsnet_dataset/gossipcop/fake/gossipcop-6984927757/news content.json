The rumor mill has recently been claiming that the pair secretly wed in a private ceremony nearly seven months ago and simply never made an announcement to the public.\n\nFor the morning coffee date (where they were met by Miley\u2019s mom, Trish), Miley chose an oversized pullover that made her look totally pants-less. Though it\u2019s unclear whether she was sporting some shorts underneath, they would have to be pretty micro-mini, as there was no hint of anything peeking out of the bottom of her already short tunic top. She kicked her look up a notch with classic black Dr. Martens (which you can buy here).\n\nBoth the 24-year-old singer and her 27-year-old beau are still sporting rings on THAT finger, further leading to speculation that the pair have secretly said their vows. For such a photographed couple, however, we kind of love the prospect that they call each other husband and wife and the public is none the wiser.\n\nMGJR, STBR\n\nRelated: Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Wore Wedding Bands to Visit the Place Where They First Met\n\nCheck this out:", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a04a2aa70ae4e37c2ec6545/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a04a293545af946d5bbdf1b/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-140049417.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d0f951fe41037b343994dc6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-miley-ariana-lana.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d013a7cc546b6db31b20081/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d0a4b9b501fc34d964c49db/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-miley-ariana-lana.jpg", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/588fb1d474508ccc46b567b0/1:1/w_80%2Cc_limit/DSC_9440%2525202.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d289633ab15010009f3d781/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-hero-miley-cyrus-hannah-montana.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d110cc1e41037750c994df3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Celeb%2520Weekend%2520Roundup%25206.24_Story.jpg", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d150d420f95180008630668/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/roundup_Story.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d272a1e91b4bc000822c283/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-maggie.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a04a27c6a66c92585b50fa9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/BGUS_923837_025.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d16aba80f951800086306cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-lede-turner-joe-jonas.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a04a2aa70ae4e37c2ec6545/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lauren Rearick", "De Elizabeth", "Tatum Dooley", "Avery Mater", "Bianca Betancourt", "Kara Nesvig"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-wedding-rumors-fueled-matching-rings", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Wedding Rumors Fueled by Matching Rings", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Miley Cyrus was spotted\u2014totally pants-less\u2014in Savannah, Georgia on a coffee run with Liam Hemsworth.
