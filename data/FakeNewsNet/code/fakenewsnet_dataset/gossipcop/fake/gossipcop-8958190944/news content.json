However, one major nominee decided to sit this one out: Justin Bieber.\n\n\n\nLast night while his ex-girlfriend made her first public appearance with her new boyfriend, The Weeknd, Bieber answered questions from fans and thusly got petty.\n\n\n\nDuring a live Instagram video, a friend asked the 22-year-old singer, \"[What's your] favorite song of the moment?\" He replied, \"Um, 'Starboy' by The Weeknd.\"\n\n\n\nThe two friends then let out a major laugh for several drawn-out seconds. \"Oh shit, that was funny. We gotta end it now. Oh, that was too funny.\u201d\n\n", "images": ["https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/c61/0,2,3648,1915/x,80/1745005/image.jpg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/94ef6f5acdd752723f8644874464d07a.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/a899ed2b6826791e2b8dd7b2901f3668.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/94aebf5b5499306ab207a2b4f13e34a8.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/563283d1407bc6df5095935bc30a3daa.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/e0a9b3381492f1a143fc3d5144778c26.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg"], "top_img": "https://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/c61/0,2,3648,1915/x,80/1745005/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shannon Carlin", "Kaitlin Reilly", "Lydia Wang", "Kathryn Lindsay", "Meagan Fredette", "Alexis Reliford", "Justin Bieber Lyrics Dis Ex Selena Gomez", "The Weeknd"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/02/140693/justin-bieber-grammys-selena-gomez-video", "title": "Justin Bieber Lyrics Dis Ex Selena Gomez and The Weeknd", "meta_data": {"title": "Justin Bieber Lyrics Dis Ex Selena Gomez and The Weeknd", "description": "Come on Biebs.
