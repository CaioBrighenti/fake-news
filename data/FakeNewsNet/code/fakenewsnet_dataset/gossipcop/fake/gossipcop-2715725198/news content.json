Some compared the look to Elizabeth Hurley\u2019s famous 90s Versace gown, while others focused on the amount of skin the actress showed while posing outside next to men in suits. The attention surrounding the dress was more than Lawrence preferred, however, and she took to her Facebook account to address it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know where to get started on this \u2018Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold\u2019 controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended,\u201d she wrote on Wednesday. \u201cThat Versace dress was fabulous, you think I\u2019m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.\u201d\n\nShe continued to call the discussions \u201csexist,\u201d saying they were \u201ccreating silly distractions from real issues.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd88ae8fd2b3a999c5b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6607ea47fd88021e400ba6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Razzies-Forgotten-Movies.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd7c907581c4e97c58d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a282a7b2d48cc419d393d2e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence-Oprah-Interview.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd9221d14714f6de43f70/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/lede-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d1a184a2bdf8300094c7f2b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-526640060.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a85de867d9068584d650e15/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Chris-Fischer-Amy-Schumer-Wedding.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d02ab2776711f03ed7fe6a3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-relationship.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd7c907581c4e97c58e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS03.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Yohana Desta", "Hilary Weaver", "Kenzie Bryant", "Josh Duboff", "Erika Harwoo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/02/jennifer-lawrence-calls-out-sexist-debate-over-her-versace-dress", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Calls Out \u201cSexist\u201d Debate Over Her Versace Dress", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "\u201cIf I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d", "keywords": "jennifer lawrence,versace,vanities", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "\u201cIf I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Calls Out \u201cSexist\u201d Debate Over Her Versace Dress", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/02/jennifer-lawrence-calls-out-sexist-debate-over-her-versace-dress"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u201cIf I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Calls Out \u201cSexist\u201d Debate Over Her Versace Dress"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
