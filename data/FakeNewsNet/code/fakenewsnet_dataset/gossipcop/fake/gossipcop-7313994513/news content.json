All these years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends alum for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source tells In Touch exclusively.\n\nFollowing his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now he\u2019s \u201cin touch with emotions and his true self like never before,\u201d the source says. That level of self-awareness comes with some massive realizations, it seems. \u201cHe\u2019s come to realize that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,\u201d the source adds. \u201cAnd while Brad's not in love with Jen, he realizes how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he\u2019s seeing everything more clearly.\u201d\n\nOf course, these realizations may be coming too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now. And while Brad would \u201cnever dream of\u201d ruining his ex\u2019s new marriage, he \u201cwould take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.\u201d (He could have that chance if it\u2019s true that Jen and Justin are having marital discord.)\n\nIf they can\u2019t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits. \u201cThey worked well together\u201d when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad tells In Touch. \u201cHe wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.\u201d\n\nThat kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider says she wants in on \u201cprestige projects\u201d under his production banner. \u201cShe\u2019d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress \u2014 something that\u2019s evaded both her and Angelina.\u201d\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Brad and Jen reconvene in some capacity, though it seems he\u2019ll always want her back by his side. \u201cHe still considers Jen the love of his life,\u201d In Touch\u2019s source says.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux.jpg?w=1180#038;h=625&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Knox-Vivienne-Jolie-Pitt-Promo.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston.jpg?w=1180#038;h=750&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-aniston-and-brad-pitt.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brad-Pitt.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brad-Pitt-Dating-Life.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jen-Aniston-Mystery-Man.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-aniston-and-brad-pitt.jpg?fit=200%2C1"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-aniston-and-brad-pitt.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Clarendon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/jennifer-aniston-and-brad-pitt-146995/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt: He Thinks 2005 Divorce Was One of His Biggest Mistakes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Fans who\u2019ve been shipping Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston ever since their 2005 divorce may actually have cause for hope!
