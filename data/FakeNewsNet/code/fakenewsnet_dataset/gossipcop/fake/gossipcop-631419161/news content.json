Kylie Jenner and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian \u2014 who both have babies on the way with their respective boyfriends, Travis Scott and Tristan Thompson \u2014 reportedly have crazy demands for their upcoming deliveries.\n\nAccording to OK! Magazine, Kylie, 20, and Khlo\u00e9, 33, are \u201calready driving the staff at LA\u2019s Cedars-Sinai hospital nuts.\u201d While the Kylie Cosmetics founder has requested a completely stocked snack bar for her hospital room, KoKo is demanding that her room includes a brand-new bathtub in case she decides to have an underwater birth. On top of that, an insider tells the publication that both moms-to-be have decided that light gray, 1,000-thread count sheets are a necessity during their deliveries.\n\nThough both Keeping Up With the Kardashians beauties have buns in the oven, neither have confirmed the exciting baby news themselves. However, it seems that both reality stars are looking forward to first-time motherhood.\n\n\u201cTristan and I definitely talk about starting a family,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said on the last season of KUWTK. \u201c[Tristan] wants to have five or six kids with me and that\u2019s lovely. We could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I\u2019m not on birth control is just like \u2014 it\u2019s scary. It\u2019s like a really big step.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Kylie has always wanted to have kids sooner than later. \u201cI want kids for sure. I feel like seeing you guys go through everything, it\u2019s great knowledge,\u201d the lip kit queen said during a February 2016 episode of Kocktails With Khlo\u00e9. \u201cI feel like I want kids before I\u2019m 30.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Farrah-Abraham-Checkered-Blazer-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C74px%2C2752px%2C1554px&resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/khloe-jordyn-combine.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Amy-Duggar-Pregnancy-Update-Feature.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C480px%2C271px&resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-01-at-10-59-06-am.png?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lala-kent-randall-emmett-e1562958407866.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-01-at-10-59-06-am.png?fit=200%2C1"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-01-at-10-59-06-am.png?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Magazine", "Dec"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/khloe-kardashian-kylie-jenner-diva-delivery-room-demands-148000/", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner Have Diva Delivery Room Demands", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "A diva is the female version of a hustla\u2026or maybe just a pregnant Kardashian-Jenner sister.
