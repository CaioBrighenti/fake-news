The actress dismissed silly speculation by saying the timing is all in the name of work.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m at work, you can\u2019t wear a wedding ring in costume,\u201d the 27-year-old actress told \u201cExtra\u201d on Monday. \u201cIf your character\u2019s not married, it\u2019s gonna look really weird if you have a wedding ring on. There is nothing more to it \u2014 I simply cannot wear it when I am in costume.\u201d\n\nRobbie secretly married her husband, Tom Ackerley, last December in Australia. The two later confirmed their nuptials with a sassy picture that was a hit on social media.\n\nA post shared by @margotrobbie on Dec 19, 2016 at 7:56pm PST\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many other people on Instagram announce their engagement that way now,\u201d the actress told Vogue Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny, so bizarre.\u201d\n\nRobbie and Ackerley now have a year of marriage under their belt, but the actress insists that \u201cnothing\u2019s really changed.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b967d01200000080b37bb45.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d28b6583b00003900dac405.jpeg?ops=424_244", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2524bc24000051179350f4.png?cache=viET1XLEN4&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a51c041400005f0d9a800f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d261e983b00004d00dac064.jpeg?cache=DLFVLOLMkV&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d1b69472400003500faa350.jpeg?cache=9GpV6J60vM&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ceefc152500005500dbd234.jpeg?cache=uGSKDIrHrq&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2740243b00004d00dac1bf.jpeg?cache=CGXTISAWUk&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1910_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d26503c240000ff349352ac.png?cache=JbKf5zIvlJ&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f1024140000196c50fe30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d275db82400009d1793540b.jpeg?cache=5yQWsxINH8&ops=424_244"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1910_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lifestyle Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/margot-robbie-doesnt-wear-wedding-ring-every-day_n_5a1ef8f1e4b01edb1a81ac9b", "title": "The Simple Reason Margot Robbie Doesn't Wear A Wedding Ring Every Day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "description": "Makes sense!", "keywords": "Australia celebrity relationships  margot robbie", "og": {"title": "The Simple Reason Margot Robbie Doesn't Wear A Wedding Ring Every Day", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1910_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1910_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1910, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/margot-robbie-doesnt-wear-wedding-ring-every-day_n_5a1ef8f1e4b01edb1a81ac9b", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Makes sense!"}, "article": {"tag": "Australia celebrity relationships  margot robbie", "section": "Weddings", "published_time": "2017-11-29T21:20:10Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-29T21:20:10Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HPLifestyle", "title": "The Simple Reason Margot Robbie Doesn't Wear A Wedding Ring Every Day", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1910_1000", "width": 1910, "height": 1000}, "description": "Makes sense!"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a1ef8f1e4b01edb1a81ac9b", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "weddings"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511990410.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
