Life & Style has exclusively learned that TV producers have come up with an idea to bring O.J. Simpson and his old pal Caitlyn Jenner together in a televised reunion.\n\nThe former football star, 70, who was acquitted of double homicide in 1995 and completed a nine-year prison stint on Oct. 1 for a 2007 armed robbery and kidnapping, has known Caitlyn, 68, since\n\nshe was Olympic gold medalist Bruce. They also share the Kardashian connection: Long before Caitlyn married into the family, O.J. was best buds with Kris\u2019 first husband, Robert. O.J. should be interested in the show, a source says, but there\u2019s a snag: Caitlyn has \u201cwanted nothing to do with O.J.\u201d since the NFL star was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nThough they haven\u2019t approached her yet, producers are hoping to convince Caitlyn to sign on by pitching it as \u201can informative, interview-type show,\u201d the source says, in which she introduces\n\nO.J. to the new Caitlyn and asks him probing questions about his ups and downs. \u201cIf they do\n\nit right,\u201d says the source, \u201cit would be fascinating.\u201d\n\nAnd while the public, might be hesitant to watch such a reunion, the producers are convinced plenty of people will tune in to view the show. \u201cLove them or hate them,\u201d says a source, \u201cputting Caitlyn and O.J. in the same room would be must-see TV.\u201d\n\nFor more on this and all your favorite celebrity news, pick up the new issue of Life & Style, on stands now!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Carrie-Underwood.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lottie-tomlinson-tanologist-e1562945068594.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/oj-simpson-kris-jenner.jpg?w=1180#038;h=600&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sonja-morgan-e1562955065544.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/caitlyn-jenner-oj-simpson.png?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/billie-lee-jax-taylor-e1562773736320.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/caitlyn-jenner-oj-simpson.png?resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/caitlyn-jenner-oj-simpson.png?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Magazine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/caitlyn-jenner-oj-simpson-reunion-146820/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner and O.J.
