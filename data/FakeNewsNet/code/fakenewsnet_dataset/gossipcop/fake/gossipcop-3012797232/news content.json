And, like Sally Field at the end of Steel Magnolias, I want to know why.\n\nYou might think, Oh, this is just a wacky one-off. Some rogue stylist made a bold choice and Nick is just trying to downplay it. Out here like Daniel Bedingfield, muttering \"Gotta get through this...\" to himself. But, the gag is, he seems to be aware he's wearing a turban. And he wants you to know about it, too.\n\n[image id='61d51462-8d02-4d81-af18-76e71fa83398' mediaId='cc518017-0cbd-40bb-8851-c0dc2e2d0c97' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='medium'][/image]\n\nFirst of all, Mother Cannon, I'm unclear about why you are pointing to the turban, as if our attention could be anywhere else. It is literally being held together by the North Star; we noticed.\n\n[image id='567f9abc-6eee-484a-9921-a3449e30f59f' mediaId='58312dc6-babc-4d32-bd02-ab811e18f83f' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='extrasmall'][/image]\n\nOf course, Cannon has a propensity for pointing, even when it's not necessary. Take this photo from Red Nose Day:\n\n[image id='26804c67-f7ad-4f1d-b4fc-f0129e77e50a' mediaId='7303f13e-0ec2-43e4-b266-dd23582b1551' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='M'][/image]\n\nPhotographer: Can you wear the nose, please?\n\nMother Cannon: I am wearing it.\n\nPhotographer: Yes, but it's supposed to go on your face. Like an actual nose.\n\nMother Cannon: I know. But this here is a nose finger. It's comedy. Ask about it. And I'm pointing to it so people know that this here is the joke. The nose finger. Scratch and sniff? Finger nose. Finger Cannon! I'm workshopping here. Is this too on the...what's the word I'm looking for?\n\nPhotographer: Nose?\n\nMother Cannon: Finger.\n\nSo, if you're taking notes at home for your Nick Cannon fashion journal, he sniffs at red noses but will turn up for a turban. And it's not a new development.\n\nHere he is at the VMAs, in a sleeveless look giving you Aunt Joanne at the Labor Day cookout:\n\n[image id='ec7c56b0-f2ed-4a9e-ac77-4748b267aecd' mediaId='85d94959-2d4c-4c18-8560-739bf48d0c8b' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='small'][/image]\n\nThis look says, \"My macaroni and cheese recipe may be suspect, but my bank account is on point.\"\n\nAnd here he is in a black turban, giving you Aunt Joanne in mourning for recently deceased president of the church usher board. Yes, he will be bringing a dish to the funeral. Why do you ask?\n\n[image id='e3016dbb-7dbf-415c-a5c7-d60a3402e4e6' mediaId='71d4118b-8d30-4f87-a1ac-f70374915cf8' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='small'][/image]\n\nNow, I watched Real Husbands of Hollywood, so I know that Nick is a shrewd business person who is rolling in cash, so he can do whatever he wants. He probably has a stack of hundreds shoved up in that turban right next to his Werther's Originals and his spare handkerchief. But I'm going to need some backup testimony before I can accept this turban ministry.\n\nRight now he's giving me \"Glenn Close but no cigar\":\n\n[image id='efff81ae-38ed-4a1b-9d1d-dc2fdd31c7c6' mediaId='f646e0d7-995a-4394-b3b1-3985c9d11bf6' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='extrasmall'][/image]\n\nLike, is this the look? Is Nick Cannon slowly turning into Norma Desmond right before our eyes?\n\n[image id='46e0296a-4b46-4d09-bfa0-875bb179dfc9' mediaId='48004c1e-3e76-42e2-96fb-891750c7a2b8' caption='' loc='C' share='false' expand='true' size='extrasmall'][/image]\n\nI mean, I would not mind that at all. It sounds hilarious.\n\nBut I suspect Mother Cannon has his sights on another grand dame of the screen.\n\n[image id='5544d32b-eb21-4702-9cd9-2d0460add1ff' mediaId='2d79f821-7cf6-41b7-a967-48a8574c597e' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='extrasmall'][/image]\n\nThis latest lewk is 100 percent Dominique Deveraux and if this is what Nick Cannon is trying to give us, I am here for it!\n\n[image id='25b4c051-4338-4b2f-a64b-f0cb5774d37f' mediaId='a4b8b888-3805-431f-8bb4-1f9de12d5b68' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='small'][/image]\n\nHere for this!\n\n[image id='de9ff384-8d20-4313-bfdb-60d4a9fa66bd' mediaId='58dd7cc1-e2ec-4abf-b7a4-824ff0935fa4' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='extrasmall'][/image]\n\nHere for that Professor Quirrell realness!\n\n[image id='0ae984ba-42aa-47f5-868e-bda70a349b1f' mediaId='4254bae6-fecf-4284-9751-8104e266fafd' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='small'][/image]\n\nHere for this casual day look!\n\nNot everyone will be on board Nick's slow but heady transformation into Diahann Carroll.\n\n[image id='32e0a4b6-28e6-48f4-b9e8-b5b83d28df0b' mediaId='02667031-8242-41a8-94f8-58f03474bcd2' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='extrasmall'][/image]\n\nBut I say ignore the haters.\n\n[image id='763c795b-c339-40b1-9be7-dc56f7456509' mediaId='9a5bb232-d0da-4735-aa86-a5f89885eac9' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='extrasmall'][/image]\n\nI salute you, Nick Cannon. Live your \"matriarch of the family,\" \"it's too hot out here to be wearing a wig anyway\" truth. You keep that head held high! No matter how heavy all the fabric wrapped around it is.\n\n[image id='839f5053-4ab2-484b-a3e3-2391d0e007b3' mediaId='2420101d-da4a-4faf-9b00-f79bfbc873e1' caption='' loc='C' share='true' expand='true' size='extrasmall'][/image]\n\nFollow R.
