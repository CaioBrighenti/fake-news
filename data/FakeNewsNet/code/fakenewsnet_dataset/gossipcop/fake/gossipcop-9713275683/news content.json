It looks like the two are having a great time. Natasha nails the choreography, which probably means that she learned it from JLo herself.\n\nThe video was taken on a boat on what looks like a vacation in Idaho, judging from Rodriguez's next two posts, which show the whole clan (her kids and his kids) together.\n\nThis isn't the first time Lopez and Rodriguez have enjoyed some quality time with each other's kids. Both have two children from previous marriages, and they both seem like they've very close with their kids. Lopez has 10-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex-husband Marc Anthony, and Rodriguez has 10-year-old Ella and 13-year-old Natasha with ex-wife Cynthia Rodriguez.\n\nAlthough JLo says she's not rushing into marriage with A-Rod\u2014 they've been together for around a year and a half \u2014 one of her new songs, \"El Anillo,\" dropped a hint that she just might be ready to take the next step.\n\nRegardless of whether \"J-Rod\" make it official, there's no debating that Lopez would be a great step mom.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b32582c7708e92de37d678d-750-562.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b32582c7708e92de37d678e-750-375.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b32582c7708e92de37d678e-750-375.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Schmalbruch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-daughter-dance-dinero-2018-6", "title": "This video of Jennifer Lopez teaching Alex Rodriguez's daughter the 'Dinero' choreography proves that she'd be the best step mom ever", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-06-26", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-26", "news_keywords": "Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Dancing, Instagram, Celebrities, Sarah Schmalbruch", "sailthru.tags": "Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Dancing, Instagram, Celebrities, Sarah Schmalbruch", "description": "Alex Rodriguez recently posted an Instagram video showing Jennifer Lopez dancing with his daughter Natasha.
