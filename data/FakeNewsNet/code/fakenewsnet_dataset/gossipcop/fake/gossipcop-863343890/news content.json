Staying friendly with directors is good business, but one has to also be right for the role. Regardless, an impeccable Miller source tells Gossip Cop the claim is \u201cdefinitely not true.\u201d\n\nIt would probably be wise, at this point, for Life & Style, to steer clear of stories relating to Affleck. Remember, this is the same publication that falsely claimed in a cover story that Jennifer Garner was pregnant with Affleck\u2019s fourth child in April 2016. And just a few months ago, Gossip Cop busted the tabloid when it wrongly reported Affleck was back together with Jennifer Lopez.
