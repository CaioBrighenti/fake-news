I\u2019m bummed, but look forward to seeing Barbie on the big screen.\u201d\n\nThe big screen adaptation of Mattel\u2019s iconic toy line was expected to start production this summer on June 23, but Schumer\u2019s busy schedule includes a lengthy promotional tour for her new Fox comedy \u201cSnatched,\u201d which opens in May, as well as an upcoming shoot for Rebecca Miller\u2019s \u201cShe Came to Me\u201d opposite Steve Carell.\n\nSony needed to stick to its June 29, 2018 release date since Mattel already has merchandise and product cycles in motion\u2013shifting the production to accommodate Schumer would have put on a strain on other partners on the film, according to insiders.\n\n\u201cWe respect and support Amy\u2019s decision,\u201d a spokesperson for Sony said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to bringing Barbie to the world and sharing updates on casting and filmmakers soon.\u201d\n\nSony is still trying to find a director for the comedy. The \u201cBarbie\u201d movie is said to be in the vein of \u201cSplash\u201d, \u201cEnchanted\u201d and \u201cBig.\u201d In it, the main character gets kicked out of Barbieland for not being perfect enough and lands in a real-world adventure.\n\nSchumer recently did a polish of the script. It\u2019s unknown whether the same tone will be kept with the comedian no longer attached.\n\nWalter F. Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Amy Pascal are producing the film. Parkes and MacDonald initiated the original deal with Mattel in 2014.\n\nSchumer can be seen next in the action-comedy \u201cSnatched,\u201d which opens on May 12, 2017, and also has \u201cThank You for Your Service\u201d opening in October. She is repped by UTA, Carrie Byalick at B Company and Maverick Management.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
