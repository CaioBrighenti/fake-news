Sure the 38-year-old reality star hits the gym regularly, but it\u2019s her clean eating habits that help her \u201cstay on track.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to eat healthy and include as many organic whole foods as possible,\u201d Kardashian writes in a new post on her website, which details her \u201ccurrent meal plan.\u201d\n\nWhen the mom-of-three wakes up, before even thinking about food, she takes collagen supplements on an empty stomach followed by a glass of water mixed with one tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar 20 minutes later. \u201cBoth of these habits have a ton of health benefits that affect everything from your skin to the way your body processes nutrients,\u201d Kardashian explains. The apple cider vinegar blend, known to help with weight loss, is in her daily regimen twice along with vegan probiotics shots\u2014both before breakfast and dinner.\n\nRELATED: Kourtney Kardashian Says She\u2019s a \u2018Happy Woman\u2019 in a Thong Bikini On Her Romantic Mexican Vacation Before the star hits the gym for a good sweat, without fail, she enjoys her fresh avocado pudding. \u201cIt only takes a few minutes to make and it provides healthy fats to give me energy before a workout,\u201d she says. And after that she fills up on whole grain oatmeal\u2014but not the instant variety\u2014made fresh on the stove.\n\nRELATED: Kourtney Kardashian Says She\u2019s a \u2018Happy Woman\u2019 in a Thong Bikini On Her Romantic Mexican Vacation Before the star hits the gym for a good sweat, without fail, she enjoys her fresh avocado pudding. \u201cIt only takes a few minutes to make and it provides healthy fats to give me energy before a workout,\u201d she says.

You can find her eating a salad with some good protein like chicken or salmon. But to truly eat like the star, toss the bottled dressings. Kardashian sticks to making her own as she lives a life mostly void of sugar and nearly anything processed.\n\nWhen the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star gets an afternoon hankering for some food fuel, she reaches for fresh veggies with avocado hummus, raw almonds or fresh fruit.\n\nImage zoom Kourtney Kardashian/Instagram\n\nDinner time is light in the Kardashian household. \u201cI love fresh, simple soups made with asparagus, sweet potatoes or beets,\u201d she says before adding that she also likes a turkey chili, which she can prep extra of on Sundays so she\u2019s set for the week.\n\nWant the ultimate dish on the latest celebrity food news, plus exclusive recipes, videos and more?

really important to have something sweet,\u201d she says of her go-to matcha chia seed pudding that she adds is \u201cworth it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I derail from eating healthy sometimes,\u201d Kardashian admits, \u201cbecause you have to live your life!\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/alexandra-medina.jpg",
