THE ROYAL UK can reveal the truth. We\u2019re told it\u2019s \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nThe unsubstantiated allegation can be found in the latest issue of OK! The misleading headline reads as, \u201cMeghan and Harry: Royal Rule Breakers\u201d. In the following story, the tabloid suspiciously contends that Queen Elizabeth was unhappy with Markle\u2019s casual outfit. They also claimed that the Queen didn\u2019t like the affectionate and PDA-filled attitude towards Prince Harry.\n\nAlso Read: Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend Meghan Markle finally meets Queen Elizabeth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA so-called \u201cpalace insider\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cThe Queen thought Meghan\u2019s loose, men\u2019s-style shirt, ripped jeans and oversized bag were not a suitable choice for her first public engagement with the prince.\u201d After seeing photographs of the couple at the Invictus Games, OK! magazine goes on to claim that the Queen has requested Prince Harry and Markle not to hold hands in public.\n\nThere have been some reports that the Queen asked both of them to attend coaching sessions on \u201croyal protocol and etiquette.\u201d \u201cMeghan needs to step up her game to join the royal family. Luckily, the Queen is prepared to do whatever necessary to help,\u201d concludes the outlet\u2019s alleged \u201cinsider.\u201d\n\nBut THE ROYAL UK investigated into the whole matter, and not surprisingly, a royal source tells us the report is \u201ccompletely fake.\u201d Queen Elizabeth was not upset with the actress over her first public outing with Prince Harry, nor was she disappointed with Markle\u2019s outfit and attitude at the annual sporting event. Additionally, a \u201creal\u201d palace insider wouldn\u2019t be discussing such details with OK! magazine. The article is nothing more than a fabrication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, this isn\u2019t the first time OK! has tried to dupe its readers into thinking it has reputable sources for the royal family. In September, THE ROYAL UK corrected the outlet for inaccurately announcing a \u201cwedding of the century\u201d for Markle and Prince Harry on its cover. In that story, a purported \u201cpalace planner\u201d claimed to have the scoop on the couple\u2019s \u201cbig day,\u201d but as we noted at the time, a genuine royal source wouldn\u2019t have fed an American tabloid with information about a royal wedding before an engagement was even announced. Similarly to that bogus report, this latest one is equally manufactured.\n\nRelated\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/theroyaluk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/nh.jpg?resize=177%2C118", "http://theroyaluk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/15697594_1913523002213716_531238097483291427_n.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/theroyaluk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Kate-Middleton-Prince-William-kids-1.jpg?resize=177%2C118", "https://i1.wp.com/theroyaluk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-Took-Their-First-Public-Pictures-As-a-Couple-at-Invictus-Games-Toronto.jpg?resize=632%2C480", "https://i1.wp.com/theroyaluk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Queen-Elizabeth-Disappointed-Meghan-Markle-First-Outing-600x426.jpg?resize=676%2C480", "https://i1.wp.com/theroyaluk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Queen-Elizabeth-Disappointed-Meghan-Markle-First-Outing-600x426.jpg?fit=676%2C480", "https://i0.wp.com/theroyaluk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/D5gwOTTWAAAnEj9.jpg?resize=177%2C118"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/theroyaluk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Queen-Elizabeth-Disappointed-Meghan-Markle-First-Outing-600x426.jpg?fit=676%2C480", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://theroyaluk.com/queen-isnt-disappointed-meghan-outing/", "title": "Queen isn\u2019t disappointed with Meghan Markle over first public outing with Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Queen isn't disappointed with Meghan Markle over first public outing with Prince Harry - The Royal UK", "description": "Queen Elizabeth was not at all disappointed with Meghan Markle over her first public outing with Prince Harry at the 2017 Invictus Games.
