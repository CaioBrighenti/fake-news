In fact, a source tells Us Weekly that the actor wouldn\u2019t have minded if they never walked down the aisle at all.\n\n\u201cHe had reservations at the time because they still hadn\u2019t figured out where they were going to live as a couple. Justin was absolutely head over heels in love with Jen \u2014 and probably always will be \u2014 but marriage was never important to him,\u201d the insider says of Theroux, who was previously in a 14-year relationship with costume designer Heidi Bivens. \u201cMarriage was always just a piece of paper to Justin, and he didn\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nBut Aniston did. \u201cConstant scrutiny of Jen\u2019s personal life, including whether she would ever find her happily ever after, played a huge role in her marriage to Justin,\u201d the source tells Us. \u201cIt was obvious Jen needed more than an engagement or to be life partners with Justin. He didn\u2019t want to lose her, so they got married.\u201d\n\nIn the end, things didn\u2019t work out and the couple decided to call it quits after two years of marriage. \u201cIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,\u201d they told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. \u201cThis decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d\n\nAniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, added, \u201cNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\u201d\n\nThe separation was caused in part by distance. \u201cJen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,\u201d a source previously told Us. \u201cNew York City wasn\u2019t ever going to be home for Jen.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Jen Heger.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
