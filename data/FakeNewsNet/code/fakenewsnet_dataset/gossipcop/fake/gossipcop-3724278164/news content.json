[He\u2019s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he\u2019s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own \u2013 starting his own church \u2013 we\u2019re not quite sure, but that\u2019s the word from an inside source.\u201d\n\nApologising to his fans via TMZ for cancelling his upcoming shows, Bieber said: \u201cI love you guys, I think you guys are awesome. Sorry for anyone who feels disappointed or betrayed, it\u2019s not in my heart [or] anything, and have a blessed day.\u201d", "images": ["https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/10/placeholder.jpg", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2018/06/REV.NME_.WEB_.80px-1.png", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2019/02/trendell_2019-150x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Trendell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/justin-bieber-starting-church-2116040", "title": "Is Justin Bieber starting up his own church?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Is Justin Bieber starting up his own church? - NME", "description": "Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/justin-bieber-starting-church-2116040", "site_name": "NME", "updated_time": "2017-07-26T14:18:42+01:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine", "section": "Music News", "published_time": "2017-07-25T09:02:55+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-26T14:18:42+01:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 208195102528120, "pages": 9577714166}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church", "title": "Is Justin Bieber starting up his own church? - NME", "site": "@NME", "image": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "creator": "@AndrewTrendell"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2016/10/cropped-nme-site-icon-300x300.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500969775.0, "source": "http://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
