(Michael Sohn/Associated Press)\n\nAn appellate court in Brazil ruled Friday that the case against Ryan Lochte should be dismissed. The U.S. swimmer had been accused of fabricating a story about getting robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro during August\u2019s Olympics, causing an international scandal that drew in some of his teammates.\n\nLochte was charged with a false crime report, which could have resulted in a sentence of one to six months in jail, although he would have been unlikely to serve it. The 12-time Olympic medalist returned to the United States before the Games ended and the charge was filed, but he was given a 10-month suspension by USA Swimming for his behavior in Rio.\n\nAccording to USA Today, the court concluded that Lochte, who eventually admitted he \u201cover-exaggerated\u201d the story and apologized for his \u201cimmature behavior,\u201d did not break Brazilian law. The three-judge panel, in a 2-1 ruling, noted that Rio police, not Lochte, had initiated the investigation and that the story he first told NBC did not meet the standard of a false report.\n\nProsecutors could still challenge the ruling, and they have 15 days to do so. Lochte\u2019s lawyers have been pressing for a dismissal of the case, but a lower court had ruled 2-1 to uphold the charge.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the court has finally dismissed the criminal prosecution against Mr. Lochte, while at the same time, appropriately recognizing that he committed no crime,\u201d Jeff Ostrow, a Florida-based attorney for Lochte, told USA Today. \u201cIt has been a long year, but in the end, justice prevailed.\u201d\n\nLochte had said that he and three other U.S. swimmers, Jimmy Feigen, Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, were on their way back to the Olympic Village from a party when their car was pulled over by gun-toting robbers pretending to be police officers. Citing surveillance video footage and eyewitness accounts, Brazilian authorities claimed that Lochte and his teammates vandalized and urinated on a gas station, after which security guards pointed a gun at them and demanded recompense before they left.\n\nLochte subsequently said that he \u201cdefinitely had too much to drink\u201d that night, adding that he was still intoxicated when he provided false details to NBC\u2019s Billy Bush the day after the incident. While he was able to leave Brazil quickly, his three teammates were detained, with Feigen agreeing to pay a fine of nearly $11,000 to expedite his departure.\n\nIn the wake of the firestorm, which overshadowed the second week of the Olympics, Lochte lost several sponsors. His suspension left him unable to compete at last month\u2019s U.S. nationals, making him ineligible for the world championships later this month in Budapest.\n\nThe notoriety Lochte earned from the incident resurfaced at the ESPY awards this week, when host Peyton Manning joked that last year\u2019s host, professional wrestler John Cena, \u201cis an athlete the same way that Ryan Lochte is a reliable witness.\u201d\n\nLochte\u2019s suspension ended on July 1, and he had planned on competing this week at the Los Angeles Invitational, but he pulled out, citing the birth last month of his first child. The 32-year-old has said he wants to return to top-level competitions, though, and represent the U.S. at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VbKAPWEqmseAiYnF0jp1oR44KXo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4H6J6Z5LAYDTMFW2ISSFXN464.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tW3sGGFe7qeNZ-jP82D8-dr87lA=/960x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F5V5P3QJ2E7FFBR5UQPPGP2TVY.jpg", "http://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VbKAPWEqmseAiYnF0jp1oR44KXo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4H6J6Z5LAYDTMFW2ISSFXN464.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams", "July", "Des Bieler Is A Staff Writer In Sports Who Covers A Wide Variety Of Topics", "Including Fantasy Football.
