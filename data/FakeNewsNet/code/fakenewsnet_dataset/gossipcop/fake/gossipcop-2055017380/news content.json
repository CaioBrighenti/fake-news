Life & Style can exclusively reveal that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux \u2014 who tied the knot in August 2015 after several years of dating \u2014 are clashing over living in the big NYC.\n\n\u201cJen loves Justin, but she just doesn\u2019t want to live in the Big Apple any more than she has to,\u201d said a source, adding the Friends alum has \u201cgiven NYC her best\n\nshot.\u201d The Leftovers star is a big apple boy, and they originally agreed that Jen would spend her time there with him when she wasn\u2019t filming. Fortunately, the source continued, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to work it out.\u201d\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nFans may be somewhat shocked by this, considering last month Life & Style revealed the Wanderlust co-stars had a case of baby fever. An eyewitness spotted them at Emilio\u2019s Ballato in NYC and recalled, \u201cWhen I picked up my son, Justin pointed at him and motioned to Jen, and she turned around to smile at him. They seemed to be so smitten at the sight of children.\u201d We certainly hope they can work things out \u2014 because we\u2019d love to see them become parents together!\n\nThis comes on the heels of reports that Jen reconnected with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, after splitting in 2005 when he met Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith. \u201cBrad wouldn\u2019t dream of breaking up Jen\u2019s marriage,\u201d a source told In Touch last month. \u201cBrad\u2019s leaning on her as a confidante now. His renewed relationship with Jen has been a huge source of support and comfort through the toughest year of his life.\u201d\n\nFor more on this, pick up the latest issue of Life & Style \u2014 and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-living-nyc.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Carrie-Underwood.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lottie-tomlinson-tanologist-e1562945068594.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-living-nyc.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/sonja-morgan-e1562955065544.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/billie-lee-jax-taylor-e1562773736320.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux.jpg?w=1180#038;h=750&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-living-nyc.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amber Belus", "Nov"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-living-nyc-145758/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Fighting About Living in NYC", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "There's trouble in paradise \u2014 again!
