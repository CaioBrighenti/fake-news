Ryan later admitted that the nation will be \u201cliving with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nThe news of the controversial bill\u2019s failure was met with excitement, pride, and mockery on Twitter, including by plenty of high-profile celebrities like Ava DuVernay, Billy Eichner, Albert Brooks, John Legend, and Mark Ruffalo.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to the #Resistance for win on Health Care,\u201d Ruffalo tweeted. \u201cDecency won, driven by you!

There's more to do, but this is a real win. https://t.co/ZkycABBOXk \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) March 24, 2017\n\nListen to Keith, guys. Go have drinks with your friends, breathe deep, Monday we're back at it. They've not done. Neither are we. https://t.co/C1MJJdkKwP \u2014 Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) March 24, 2017\n\nWhat kind of day has it been, @realDonaldTrump? \u2014 \ud83c\udf0eJoshua Malina\ud83c\udf0e (@JoshMalina) March 24, 2017\n\nHistorically unpopular, despised president, under cloud of scandal and suspicion, fails to strongarm passage of unpopular bill. \u2014 Wil Wheaton (@wilw) March 24, 2017\n\nThis is extremely important. We're going to lose a lot of fights, and we need to remember this when we do. Never stop fighting. #Resistance https://t.co/WFJ9MLo1Ro \u2014 Wil Wheaton (@wilw) March 24, 2017\n\nNo vote. The Repubs decided if they couldn't win the game, rather than play they would take their bats & ball & go home. Typical behavior. \u2014 Stephen King (@StephenKing) March 24, 2017\n\nI'm overjoyed for all the folks who get to keep their healthcare. It's a good day for America. Now let's fix the areas that need a fix! \u2764 https://t.co/sIpmby47cb \u2014 yvette nicole brown (@YNB) March 24, 2017\n\nThat #PaulRyan stood there & declared how grim the #ObamaCare future is when he has the power to institute a fix tells you even more. \u2014 yvette nicole brown (@YNB) March 24, 2017\n\nRemember government officials are elected to make things better for their constituents. If some things need to be fixed, FIX them! \u2014 yvette nicole brown (@YNB) March 24, 2017\n\nLastly, Ryan lamenting how hard it is to get the Dems' help w/GOP plans when they vowed to block EVERYTHING Obama set forth is laughable. \u2014 yvette nicole brown (@YNB) March 24, 2017\n\nWatching Paul Ryan still blame Obama.\n\nPitiful. They can\u2019t even be man enough to admit they control it now. \u2014 Albert Brooks (@AlbertBrooks) March 24, 2017\n\nMany more battles to come. This is good but it's just the start. Dig in. \u2014 Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) March 24, 2017\n\nTrump will want to pass the blame, as if #Trumpcare wasn't his even though he campaigned for it. Ryan will be the scapegoat. Popcorn please. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) March 24, 2017\n\nTurns out this was all a big misunderstanding. Trump told Ryan he wanted to retweet, not retreat. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) March 24, 2017\n\nDid Trump learn how to make deals at Trump university \u2014 Ike Barinholtz (@ikebarinholtz) March 24, 2017\n\nThank you GOP moderates for killing that putrid piece of legislation.
