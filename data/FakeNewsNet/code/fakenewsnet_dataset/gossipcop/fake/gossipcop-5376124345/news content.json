hop artists not to meet with Donald Trump following the firestorm of publicity over Kanye West.\n\nThe claim is being made by pro-Trump activist Josh Cornett, who tweeted, \u201cSources are confirming that former President Barack Obama has called Jay-Z several times over the past month pleading with Jay-Z to discourage fellow Hip Hop artists from meeting with President Trump.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udea8BREAKING: Sources are confirming that former President Barack Obama has called Jay-Z several times over the past month pleading with Jay-Z to discourage fellow Hip Hop artists from meeting with President Trump\u2026..developing pic.twitter.com/0rApmQ4DDH \u2014 \ud83d\udea8Josh Cornett\ud83d\udea8 (@therealcornett) 18 May 2018\n\nThe tweet has received over 7,600 retweets and over 10,000 likes since being posted.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. also liked the tweet, leading some to speculate that he may know that the story is true.\n\nWhile the story remains unconfirmed, it would make political sense for Democrats to deter pop icons from being seen to endorse President Trump in any way as the mid-terms draw nearer.\n\nIn the week after Kanye West tweeted his support for Candace Owens, a vocal African-American Trump supporter, Trump\u2019s popularity amongst black males jumped from 11 per cent to 22 per cent.\n\nIt has also been pointed out that before Trump ran as a Republican, he was a popular figure amongst the hip hop community, being name dropped in the lyrics of numerous hit songs.\n\nDemocrats routinely rely on endorsements from celebrities, with both Jay-Z and Beyonce being prominent supporters of Hillary Clinton during the election.\n\nAny shift away from superstars using their platforms to amplify leftist narratives would spell disaster for the Dems, who have already lost 9 per centsupport from millennial registered voters aged between18 to 34 since the 2016 election.\n\nSUBSCRIBE on YouTube:\n\nFollow on Twitter: Follow
