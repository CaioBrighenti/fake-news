(Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOnce the ultimate bachelor \u2014 and two-time People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive cover model \u2014 George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.\n\nClooney has donned many hats in his life \u2014 actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.\n\nA first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, \u201cI don\u2019t see myself ever having kids.\u201d\n\nBut it was a long road to get there. \u201cI don\u2019t have that gene that people have to replicate,\u201d he told People in 2006.\n\nWhen Esquire asked him why he wasn\u2019t married with kids, he replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t had aspirations in that way, ever.\u201d And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? \u201cWhat do you do? Should I go, \u2018I got to get me some kids right now!\u2019 and rush out and impregnate someone?\u201d\n\nClooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: \u201cWell, I\u2019m also not running for president, but I played that role in \u2018Ides of March.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t an actual lawyer when I did \u2018Michael Clayton,\u2019 and I don\u2019t fire people for a living like I did in \u2018Up in the Air.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI keep saying I\u2019ll never get married again or have children but people just don\u2019t want to believe me,\u201d Clooney told Britain\u2019s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.\n\nOf course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.\n\n\u201cElla, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,\u201d the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. \u201cGeorge is sedated and should recover in a few days.\u201d", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "http://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TWWLEZfMMW4FwBwDUYL6kyDEUwE=/960x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YNI26LVV5E2UXAUE45PPSQUFIU.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QFoT8TseUo3IV-8Yq5GPSfD1iF8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YXXAFQFY7U5WVJ4FRFI6KA5MCA.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QFoT8TseUo3IV-8Yq5GPSfD1iF8=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YXXAFQFY7U5WVJ4FRFI6KA5MCA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caitlin Moore", "Assignment Editor For Pop Culture", "June", "Caitlin Moore Is An Assignment Editor On The Pop Culture Team.
