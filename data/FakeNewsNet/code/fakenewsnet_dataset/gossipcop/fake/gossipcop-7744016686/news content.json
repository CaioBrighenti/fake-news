The Duchess of Cambridge is a regular at Wimbledon and always picks the perfect summer dress to stand out in the crowd. This year, Pippa Middleton appeared to get in on the action, attending the tournament in several looks that seemed to take cues from her sister, particularly the pale blue Tephi dress she wore today.\n\nLike her sister, Pippa has a clear preference for pastels\u2014see the blush pink crochet piece from last week and the light blue frock from this morning. Kate also gravitates toward solid colors and off-the-shoulder silhouettes; Pippa\u2019s take on the look featured asymmetric draping at the neck, which lent a playful detail. Where Kate has made straw wedges a staple in her summer wardrobe, Pippa went a different route with practical wood-soled sling-backs with a block heel. A white fold-over CH by Carolina Herrera clutch tied her ensemble together, leaving one hand free to cheer for her favorite players.\n\nSee this week\u2019s best dressed celebrities:", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5963da784ec46813a60a267e/16:9/pass/social-pippa-middleton-celebrity-style.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "http://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5963da784ec46813a60a267e/16:9/pass/social-pippa-middleton-celebrity-style.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Ward"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/pippa-middleton-kate-duchess-of-cambridge-wimbledon-celebrity-style", "title": "Pippa Middleton Keeps Channeling Kate at Wimbledon", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/pippa-middleton-kate-duchess-of-cambridge-wimbledon-celebrity-style", "title": "Pippa Middleton Keeps Channeling Kate at Wimbledon", "description": "Pippa Middleton channeled her sister Kate at Wimbledon 2017.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5963da784ec46813a60a267e/16:9/pass/social-pippa-middleton-celebrity-style.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "Pippa Middleton Keeps Channeling Kate at Wimbledon - Vogue", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5963da784ec46813a60a267e/16:9/pass/social-pippa-middleton-celebrity-style.jpg"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Pippa Middleton channeled her sister Kate at Wimbledon 2017."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=https://www.vogue.com/article/pippa-middleton-kate-duchess-of-cambridge-wimbledon-celebrity-style, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "description": "Pippa Middleton channeled her sister Kate at Wimbledon 2017.", "keywords": "Celebrity Style,Pippa Middleton,Fashion,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Celebrity Style,Pippa Middleton,Fashion,mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Fashion", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499716500.0, "source": "http://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
