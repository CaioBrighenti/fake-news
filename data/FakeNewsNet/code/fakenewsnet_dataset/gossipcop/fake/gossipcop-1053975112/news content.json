But she\u2019s already moved on \u2014 with Robert Pattinson.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been texting and enjoying secret dinners together in LA and London,\u201d a source told In Touch exclusively, explaining that Emma, 27, and Robert, 31, have been friends since they filmed 2005\u2019s Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. \u201cThey share the same sense of humor and have so much in common. They\u2019ve always had chemistry, but the timing has never been right \u2014 until now.\u201d\n\nThe new couple seemingly went public at the 2018 Golden Globes, where they presented the award for Best TV Movie or Limited Series, which went to HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies. As expected, viewers were beyond excited about seeing the pair together on the little screen.\n\nMy reaction when Emma Watson and Robert Pattinson presented together #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/7PO0uqhmvS \u2014 Arely Del Toro \ud83d\ude42 (@Mu5icGam3s) January 8, 2018\n\n\u201cHarry Potter Vibes with Emma Watson and Robert Pattinson,\u201d one fan wrote before another added, \u201cAnyone else geek out over @EmmaWatson & Robert Pattinson\u2019s #HarryPotter reunion at the #GoldenGlobes?\u201d While Emma has not spoken out about her new romance, she has been very open about dating in the past. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult in my dating life because anyone I get photographed with is automatically my boyfriend,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it just makes it look as if I\u2019ve had, like, 6,000 boyfriends!\u201d Meanwhile, Robert recently called off his engagement to longtime girlfriend FKA twigs.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Are-You-The-One-Season-8-Episode-4-Recap.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Matt-Lauer-Divorce.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mike-and-Laura-Fleiss.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-watson-robert-pattison.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/realronniemagro_65234596_201850050805475_1976547706221271105_n.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-watson-robert-pattison.jpg?resize=1000%2C600"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-watson-robert-pattison.jpg?resize=1000%2C600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Weekly"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/emma-watson-robert-pattinson-dating-149532/", "title": "Emma Watson Dating Robert Pattinson Following William Knight Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "It\u2019s been less than two months since news broke that Emma Watson split from tech entrepreneur William \u201cMack\u201d Knight.
