While the source said the friendship is not romantic in nature, Pitt is \u201cinterested in spending more time\u201d with Oxman.\n\nA rep for the actor declined to comment to PageSix, but a friend of Pitt\u2019s told the outlet that the two are \u201cjust friends.\u201d\n\nThe duo reportedly met through an MIT architecture project.
