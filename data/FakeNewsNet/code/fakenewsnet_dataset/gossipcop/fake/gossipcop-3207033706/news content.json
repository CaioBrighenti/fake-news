Though the two arrived separately, they sat together at the same table once inside the star-studded event.\n\nBut it appeared the actress tried to avoid drawing attention to herself by leaving the room and moving to a different seat just moments before Davis announced the singer\u2019s presence.\n\nHowever, Davis called out the move, saying, \u201cThis lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else.\u201d\n\nDavis added, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sit together what better night than tonight?\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t the first time they have been caught looking rather coupley together.\n\nIn September, the stars were spotted walking hand in hand along the sand barefoot in Malibu, relaunching years-long buzz about a romance. And on Wednesday, the two celebrated the actor\u2019s 50th birthday with a night out in Los Angeles. They were seen leaving the Highlight Room together.\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve never officially confirmed a relationship, multiple sources have told PEOPLE the ultra-private pair have been spending time together for years.\n\nIn 2015, a source told PEOPLE they weren\u2019t getting serious. \u201cThis is not some intense romance,\u201d the source said. \u201cJamie and Katie are friends and have been for a long time. They are two adults who are attractive and single, and so apparently conclusions will be drawn. But contrary to those conclusions, they\u2019re not about to run off and make some serious commitment.\u201d\n\nAdded a Foxx source at the time: \u201c[They] see each other and go out together, but Jamie would tell you he is not involved with anyone seriously. [He]\u2019s a workaholic and couldn\u2019t be happier in his life as it is.\u201d\n\nImage zoom DOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID\n\nThe pair first made headlines when they hit the dance floor together at the Apollo in the Hamptons event in East Hampton, New York, in 2013, a little over a year after Holmes and Tom Cruise split in 2012 after six years of marriage. They jammed out to Robin Thicke\u2019s summer anthem, \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d and Foxx\u2019s 2009 hit \u201cBlame It (On the Alcohol)\u201d at the benefit concert.\n\nThe actor and musician denied that he and Holmes were an item following the encounter.\n\n\u201c[The rumors] are one hundred percent not true. In fact, it\u2019s quite hilarious because we simply danced at a charity event along with a lot of other people,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight at the time.\n\nRELATED ViDEO: Are Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Dating?\n\nSince then, the two have occasionally been spotting visiting each in L.A., where they have homes not far from each other. A new round of rumors surfaced in 2016 after the actress stepped out in New York City wearing a diamond ring (which she\u2019d been sporting for months) while Foxx was spotted wearing a gold band.\n\nFoxx\u2019s rep told PEOPLE at the time that the movie stars were neither engaged nor married.\n\nThis spring, Foxx, 49, and Holmes, 38, were spotted spending time together in Paris.\n\nHolmes met up at a hotel with Foxx, who had been in the City of Lights to shoot his new Robin Hood movie, sources confirmed at the time. (Meanwhile, Cruise was working on the sixth installment of his Mission: Impossible franchise a few blocks away.)\n\n\n\nWhile the actress kept a low profile during her Paris stay, though she did stop by Luc Besson\u2019s studio Cit\u00e9 du Cinemas, where Foxx was filming. Later, the duo were photographed boarding a private jet together out of the city.\n\nImage zoom DOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID\n\nHolmes and Foxx\u2019s stroll on the beach in Malibu this Monday was a rarely-photographed outing for the ultra-discreet duo. They splashed around in the water, with Foxx venturing knee-deep into the waves fully dressed.\n\nAn eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight that they were on a public beach after visiting a friend\u2019s house in the area. They \u201csat down very close to each other, chatting for a while outside, and spoke rather intimately\u201d during their short outing.\n\n\u201cThey looked like a pair of young kids in love,\u201d the source added. \u201cKatie looked great. She appeared to be enjoying herself and looked happy.\u201d\n\nIn a November 2014 cover story, Holmes told PEOPLE that she \u201cabsolutely\u201d still believes in love.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very loving person,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m open to finding love again.\u201d", "images":
