So I\u2019m so grateful, and I\u2019m so excited. I love you Dr. Ourian!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Exclusive: How Kim Kardashian Is Affecting Plastic Surgery Trends\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the mother of two has taken her cosmetic surgeries to social media.\n\nJust last week, she revealed that she had visited Dr. Ourian to get work done on her belly button.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m spending my Saturday with Dr. Ourian and it f\u2014\u2014 kills but it will be worth it,\u201d she explained at the time. \u201cWe are lasering. You guys, I never thought I could love someone and hate someone so much at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anyone that\u2019s had babies understand what it\u2019s done to your belly button, then you really understand how much you need Dr. Ourian to tighten around your belly button so it could look back normal,\u201d she added.\n\nIn August, Kardashian West documented a procedure with Dr. Ourian called \u201cskin-tightening,\u201d a way to get your stomach in shape without surgery, on Snapchat.\n\nU.K. cosmetic surgery group Transform reports that they have seen a 73 percent increase in inquiries from patients citing Kardashian family members as inspiration.\n\nThe trend article calls the plastic surgery craze the \u201cDash Effect,\u201d and states that after Kylie Jenner admitted to having lip fillers earlier this year, they received a 700 percent rise in inquiries about the procedure overnight.", "images":
