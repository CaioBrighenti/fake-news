The actor, 54, will soon be in London, where ex Angelina Jolie is currently filming Maleficent 2, to see his children for a second time in recent weeks.\n\nThe visit comes after a judge presiding over the former couple\u2019s divorce proceedings established a detailed schedule for him to spend time with Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and nine-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.\n\n\u201cHaving kids was always very special to him. He wanted kids for years before he met Angie. He was dreaming about being a dad. And he has always been a great dad. Very involved and present. He talks about the kids non-stop now. He brought gifts back to England,\u201d a source told People magazine.\n\nThe court papers stated, \u201cThe children not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,\u201d and that Jolie, 43, could lose full custody of the kids if she does not allow them to grow their relationships with Pitt.\n\nTheir oldest son Maddox, 16, is not included in the timetable because, according to the court, he is old enough to decide for himself how much time he wants to spend with his father.\n\n\u201cBrad has been in the best mood. Although he was away from the kids for a week, it seems just the fact that he now knows when he will see them, makes him very happy. He couldn\u2019t wait to get back to England. Not following a proper custody schedule was very difficult for him. And very sad as well,\u201d the source added.\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more\n\nFirst Published: Jul 01, 2018 16:58 IST", "images": ["https://q.quora.com/_/ad/18d72aacafe84701a5b30e418a8a6611/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/07/01/Pictures/people-gwyneth-paltrow_47eb060a-7d1e-11e8-8d5f-3f0c905295d2.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/logo-big-cm.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/ht-copy.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2018/06/13/Pictures/_2df0344c-6ee0-11e8-823f-c9ca3542d80c.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/htlogo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_90x90/HT/p2/2018/06/18/Pictures/brad-pitt_97397f54-72a4-11e8-ada9-0239ece95d2f.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/source_weather-cm.png"], "top_img": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/07/01/Pictures/people-gwyneth-paltrow_47eb060a-7d1e-11e8-8d5f-3f0c905295d2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/hollywood/brad-pitt-can-now-visit-kids-without-angelina-jolie-s-permission-is-happiest-he-s-been-in-weeks/story-a2fLsY9Z2BKpOGjpX9MogO.html", "title": "Brad Pitt can now visit kids without Angelina Jolie\u2019s permission, is happiest he\u2019s been in weeks", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "section": "hollywood", "storyid": "dd4c4cfe-7d19-11e8-8d5f-3f0c905295d2", "last-updated": "2018-07-01T17:00:01Z", "description": "\u201cBrad has been in the best mood.
