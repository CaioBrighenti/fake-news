Ugh. It\u2019s a disaster \u2014 okay. Well, we\u2019ll just have to rough it. I\u2019m gonna be just like everybody else with NO hot tea \u2014 but we\u2019re gonna try and do this one for you, because I just want to show my appreciation for everyone who speaks out for justice, and tries to make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nTwitter was overjoyed by the request, taking to their social media pages with plenty of LOL-inducing memes that even the \u201cI Don\u2019t\u201d singer herself got in on, joking, \u201cFound my tea!\u201d with a shot of herself sipping the hot beverage.\n\nNow, the Queen has taken things one step farther, releasing her own line of \u201ctea\u201d shirts (plus a commemorative mug) to mark the momentous occasion, and yes, you\u2019re going to want one.\n\nCheck out her hilarious collection below, and head over to the star\u2019s official store, MariahPride.com to snatch one up while you can!\n\n1. #FOUNDMYTEA Tee ($30): Because we *all* should look this glamorous while sipping our favorite hot drinks.\n\n2. I Was Told There Would Be Tea Tee ($30): Don a piece of meme history with this B&W shirt.\n\n3. Tea Cup Tea ($30): For when you\u2019re feeling extra cold and divalicious.\n\n4. I Was Told There Would Be Tea Mug ($20) You may not be drinking from Carey\u2019s own porcelain teacup, but this sturdy mug is sure to make you smile as you sip.\n\nWhat do you think of Mariah Carey\u2019s new tea-themed accessories?
