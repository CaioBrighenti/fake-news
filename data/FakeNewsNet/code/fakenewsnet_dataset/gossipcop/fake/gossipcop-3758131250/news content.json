Until the age of four, Payne had regular tests done in hospital as doctors noticed one of his kidneys was scarred and dysfunctional. To help cope with the pain, he had sixteen injections in his arm every morning and another sixteen every evening as a child.[9] As a student, Payne was heavily involved in sports, particularly cross country running. Payne originally joined the Wolverhampton and Bilston Athletics Club to pursue his running career. After failing to make the English National Team for the 2012 Olympic Games, he was placed on the reserve list.[10]\n\nAs he was dealing with bullying from some older students in secondary school, he took up boxing lessons at the age of twelve.[11] Payne completed 11 GCSEs at St Peter's Collegiate School before moving on to study music technology at Wolverhampton College's Paget Road campus.[5]\n\nPayne was first introduced to the world of show business at age twelve as a member of the Pink Productions Theatre Company, even appearing as Tony Manero from Saturday Night Fever.[12] Payne had previously performed in front of a crowd of 26,000 during a Wolverhampton Wanderers football match.[5][13]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nThe X Factor and One Direction [ edit ]\n\nPayne first auditioned for the fifth series of the British Singing Competition The X Factor in 2008, at just 14 years old.

Payne was considered the second favourite to win the competition following his solo audition.[16] \"He failed to progress to the Boys category at judges' houses.\" Four others in his age group did as well, but after a suggestion by Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge, they were put together to form a five-piece boy band at Wembley Arena, during the bootcamp stage of the competition, thus qualifying for the Groups category.[17] Subsequently, the group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice.
