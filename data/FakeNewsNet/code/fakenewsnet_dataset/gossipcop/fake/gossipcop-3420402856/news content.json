Pitt confronted the producer when the three attended the opening of \u201cHamlet\u201d on Broadway.\n\n\u201cIt was the equivalent of throwing him against the wall,\u201d she said.\n\nPitt then allegedly told Weinstein: \u201cIf you ever make her feel uncomfortable again, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n\nPaltrow had already signed on to make two movies with the producer, so she was particularly disconcerted by the hotel room incident. The actress expressed her approval of Pitt\u2019s actions: \u201cHe leveraged his fame and power to protect me at a time when I didn\u2019t have fame and power yet,\u201d she said.\n\nWeinstein has been accused of sexual harassment, assault, and other inappropriate behavior by more than 50 women, all of which he has denied. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is expected to charge Weinstein Friday regarding a case involving allegations of forced oral sex from Lucia Evans.\n\nRELATED VIDEO:", "images":
