As Jolie explained to NBC News in 2011, \u201cI\u2019m trying to raise [the children] to \u2026 really live a truly global [life].\"\n\nPitt, 52, grew to resent the peripatetic existence. As far back as 2009, a source told Us at the time, Pitt wanted to enroll the kids in one school in New Orleans, while Jolie preferred homeschooling to allow them to continue their travels. \u201cBrad wants them to have a normal upbringing and worries that they\u2019ll come out spoiled, elitist and not grounded,\u201d the source said at the time. \u201cBut Angie feels they should be \u2018children of the world.\u2019 They argue about it all the time: heated, screaming fights.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 interview, the Oscar-winner, 41, acknowledged Pitt was the tougher parent of the two. \"Brad's had to play bad cop more often,\" she said. But according to a Jolie friend, Pitt was too strict for his wife's liking. \"[He] became a big yeller,\u201d claims the source. \u201cAnd she would not tolerate him yelling at the kids. There were a few times Angie said she was terrified.\u201d\n\nThe War Machine actor, raised in a conservative household in Springfield, Missouri, was stern but never abusive, says a source who has worked with the family. \"When he raises his voice and yells at the kids, it's almost comical,\" says the source. \"He's not one of those guys with a temper. He's not a drill sergeant.\"\n\nAt the skate park he had installed at the Los Feliz home, Pitt would often play with the kids. But if the youngsters didn\u2019t put away their scooters and bicycles, \u201che\u2019d go, \u2018You clean up your bikes!\u2019\u201d relates the source. \u201cRegular fatherly things. He might say, \u2018How come nobody did this?\u2019 or \u2018Why didn\u2019t this get done?\u2019\u201d\n\nPitt was also a stickler when it came to bedtimes. Says the source, \"He might get upset if the kids stay up too late playing video games.\" Structure and order, adds another Pitt source, were important to him: \"Brad teaches them to be respectful human beings. Angelina lets the kids run around and behave badly.\"\n\nThe disagreements ultimately doomed the couple. Jolie filed for divorce on September 19 and requested full physical custody of the children. Their split, admits a Pitt source, \"came down to differences in lifestyle and parenting.\"\n\nFor much more on Jolie and Pitt's bitter split, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
