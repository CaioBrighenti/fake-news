The Associated Press file\n\nA fake image of a Twitter post purporting to show \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Joy Behar expressing her wish that President Donald Trump had died in a blaze Saturday at Trump Tower has gone viral.\n\nA blaze broke out Saturday on the 50th floor of the president\u2019s New York tower, killing resident Todd Brassner, 67, and injuring six firefighters, reported CNN.\n\nImages of the purported Twitter post from Behar, dated Saturday, read, \u201cFire at Trump tower, one dead \u2013 Hopefully it\u2019s Trump.\u201d The image went viral Monday on Facebook and Twitter, with some posters claiming that Behar had since removed or deleted the post.\n\nThis is truly sick. Liberals don't even hide the fact anymore that they wish for the death of our President. Last week...

That petition joins at least a dozen others on the site also calling on the network to fire Behar for various earlier comments, as well as ones seeking the dismissal of her other co-hosts or the entire show\u2019s cancellation.\n\nA Twitter post Sunday from \u201cThe View\u201d denies the purported post from Behar, calling it \u201ccompletely fabricated.\u201d The post reads, \u201cAn image of what appears to be a tweet from @JoyVBehar commenting about the president has been circulating on social media. The tweet did not come from Joy and was completely fabricated.\u201d\n\nAn image of what appears to be a tweet from @JoyVBehar commenting about the president has been circulating on social media.

And they choose not to.\u201d\n\nBehar, 75, was one of the original co-hosts on \u201cThe View\u201d in 1997. She left the show in 2013, but returned in 2015.
