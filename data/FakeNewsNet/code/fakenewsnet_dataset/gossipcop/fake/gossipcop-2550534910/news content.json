My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nKathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017\n\nThe photograph of Griffin, taken by provocative image creator Tyler Shields, went viral on Tuesday and was quickly denounced by both Trump supporters and detractors, including Chelsea Clinton and Debra Messing, among others.\n\nAfter first defending the photo, Griffin issued an apology late Wednesday. \u201cI sincerely apologize. I am just now seeing the reaction of these images. I\u2019m a comic. I crossed the line. I move the line, then I cross it. I went way too far. The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn\u2019t funny. I get it.\n\nGriffin added, \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. I will continue. I ask for your forgiveness. [I\u2019m] taking down the image, going to ask the photographer to take down the image. And I beg for your forgiveness. I went too far, I made a mistake, and I was wrong.\u201d\n\nOne person who isn\u2019t ready to forgive Griffin is Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. On Twitter, Donald called Griffin\u2019s apology \u201cphony\u201d and cited the existence of a video released by Shields and since pulled to back up his claims about her sincerity.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/claes-bang-1-2000x1333.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-93738598.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/arrow-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/netflix_thewitcher_ig-grid_phase004_04.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/the-mandalorian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger_things_s03e03_46m24s66769f_r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/ar718a_0011r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/friends-pottery-barn.jpg?crop=0px%2C224px%2C2689px%2C1413px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dressing-funny-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nup_187117_0210.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lost-boys.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/clarke-the-100.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/euphoria2-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/this-is-us-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kimmel.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger_things_s03e02_34m25s49528f_r.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/conan.jpg?crop=229px%2C313px%2C2288px%2C1202px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/twd_905_jld_0623_07796_rt.jpg?crop=0px%2C90px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/wtw_websitefeature.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/049_mindhunter_102_unit_11766r4.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/griffintrump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/griffintrump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosen"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/news/2017/05/31/donald-trump-blasts-kathy-griffin/", "title": "Donald Trump blasts Kathy Griffin for beheading photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump Kathy Griffin, Kathy Griffin, Kathy Griffin photo, Kathy Griffin Trump photo,", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump Kathy Griffin, Kathy Griffin, Kathy Griffin photo, Kathy Griffin Trump photo,", "description": "The president said Griffin 'should be ashamed'", "og": {"title": "Donald Trump Blasts Kathy Griffin for Beheading Photo", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/05/31/donald-trump-blasts-kathy-griffin/", "description": "Griffin 'should be ashamed' wrote the president on Twitter", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/griffintrump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/05/31/donald-trump-blasts-kathy-griffin/", "description": "The president said Griffin 'should be ashamed'", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/griffintrump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/05/31/donald-trump-blasts-kathy-griffin/", "title": "Donald Trump Blasts Kathy Griffin for Beheading Photo", "description": "The president said Griffin 'should be ashamed'", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/griffintrump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496203200.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}
