Brown/Getty Images\n\nJennifer Aniston has been extremely fine and okay and great for some time now \u2014 she\u2019s married to the artfully manscaped Justin Theroux, she\u2019s working on a show with Reese Witherspoon, and her ex-husband Brad Pitt is in the process of divorcing Angelina Jolie, the woman he started seeing while he and Aniston were still married, a sad fact that must send a shiver of schadenfreude up Jen\u2019s spine now and again. But Aniston doesn\u2019t want to keep all this fine and okay and great energy to herself, she wants to share it with others who may tragically be less fine. How? As she told Amy Sedaris in an interview with Harper\u2019s Bazaar:\n\nMy dream is to open a wellness center. I have a fantasy where you have this beautiful space with facialists, rotating workouts, meditation classes, and a caf\u00e9 with recipes that are healthier versions of delicious foods so you\u2019re not deprived. I\u2019m working on it in my brain. Not to sound all woo-woo, but if you go out into the world with inner peace, you\u2019re more joyful. There\u2019s a life\u2019s-too-short policy that I now have with my work; no negative Nancies.\n\nAll of that sounds (much like Aniston herself) okay and great, but the Aveeno spokesperson also shared some of the potential risks associated with attaining inner peace through facials:\n\nI had a facial and woke up later with what looked like cystic teenage acne. It was an intense thing to look at Justin\u2019s face. He was like, \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\n\nAlarming. But that probably wouldn\u2019t happen at Jen\u2019s wellness center of course, because she\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, everything\u2019s extremely fine.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/11/MM0143_LG_VALENTINO_5617_31_V4.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-alien-area-51.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-helen-mirren.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/09/14/Jennifer-Aniston.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-belle-delphine.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/party-pics/party-pics-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-alligator-lagoon.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/08/8-Ghislaine-Maxwell.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-serena-williams-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-quilt.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/07/12/sales/12-Sales-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/10/10-st-thomas-epstein.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-donald-trump-aubrey-o-day.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-allie-long-1.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-Marc-Veyrat-cheddar.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/07/11/outdoor-voices-micro/11-outdoor-voices-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/GettyImages-1133537447-feed.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/galleries/thecut/2019/07/Weddings-1/10-header.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/09/14/Jennifer-Aniston.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-luann-1.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/HL_LG_HERO.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/10/10-boia.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/09/14/Jennifer-Aniston.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madeleine Aggeler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/09/jennifer-aniston-dreams-of-opening-a-wellness-center.html", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Dreams of Opening a Wellness Center", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Aniston Dreams of Opening a Wellness Center", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/09/jennifer-aniston-dreams-of-opening-a-wellness-center.html", "description": "But she doesn\u2019t want to sound \u201call woo-woo\u201d about it.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/09/14/Jennifer-Aniston.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Jennifer Aniston Dreams of Opening a Wellness Center", "description": "But she doesn\u2019t want to sound \u201call woo-woo\u201d about it.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/09/14/Jennifer-Aniston.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mmaggeler", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-14T18:43:03.557-04:00", "tag": "culture, celebrity, jennifer aniston, wellness, celebrity wellness", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "In an interview with Amy Sedaris for Harper\u2019s Bazaar, Aniston said she doesn\u2019t want to sound \u201call woo-woo\u201d about it.", "sailthru.tags": "culture, celebrity, jennifer aniston, wellness, celebrity wellness", "author": "Madeleine Aggeler", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505428983.557, "source": "http://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
