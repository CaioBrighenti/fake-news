Gossip Cop debunked the claim when it first emerged, and now a full 12 months later, it should be clear that our information was accurate and that Jenner and Hadid are just close friends.\n\nOn July 27, 2017, Star published a ridiculous article with the headline, \u201cKendall and Bella: Undercover Lovers?\u201d The story was based on an Instagram photo of the two models posing together at the London Pride parade, just a few weeks before. According to the tabloid\u2019s report, the image of the two friends at an LGBT event was somehow proof that \u201cKendall isn\u2019t as straight as an arrow.\u201d The outlet\u2019s anonymous and untraceable \u201csource\u201d said Hadid\u2019s \u201cgay pals are telling her to try dating girls for a while,\u201d since all of the guys she was meeting turned out to be \u201ccomplete sleazebags.\u201d\n\nBut since Gossip Cop actually bases its articles on more than extrapolations from Instagram photos and comments from unidentifiable sources, we looked into the claim. Literally, no one in Jenner or Hadid\u2019s circles could confirm the tabloid\u2019s premise. However, a rep for Jenner, who was authorized to speak on her behalf, told us the story was \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\nTime has proven, as Gossip Cop noted 365 days ago, that Jenner and Hadid were not hooking up, and are simply the closest of friends. In reality, the only Hadid that Jenner has gotten physical with was Anwar, her and Gigi\u2019s younger brother. Star apparently has some sort of fantasy about Jenner being romantically involved with other female models. In the past, we busted the outlet for also falsely claiming she was dating Cara Delevingne.\n\nAnd while Jenner\u2019s spokesperson acts as a de facto primary source when fielding questions from the media about her, the model herself debunked questions about her love life this past spring. When Jenner appeared on the April cover of Vogue, she got candid about her private life and addressed rumors about her sexuality in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body,\u201d she told the fashion magazine. \u201cI\u2019m not gay, I have literally nothing to hide,\u201d added Jenner.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s also obvious these days the two models are not secret lovers. Currently, Jenner is dating NBA star Ben Simmons. In fact, the two were spotted \u201cgetting cozy\u201d at Khloe Kardashian\u2019s Fourth of July party. And for her part, it appears Hadid is back together with The Weeknd.\n\nNot only was the magazine wrong, but it never published an update or a correction. As Gossip Cop has mentioned before, we revisit stories from a year ago because we want readers to see how claims how up 12 months later and to question the sources of their entertainment news. Do outlets have sources commenting on the record or furnish any of proof for their claims?
