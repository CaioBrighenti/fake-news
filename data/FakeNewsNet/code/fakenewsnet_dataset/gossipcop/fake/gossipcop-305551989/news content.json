Meanwhile, rumors that her father, Tom Cruise, is fighting to get custody rights and that she allegedly dislikes Katie Holmes\u2019 new relationship have been debunked.\n\nHollywood Life reported on Wednesday that a \u201csource close to the [family]\u201d claimed that the 12-year-old girl started taking acting classes recently. \u201cShe\u2019s caught the acting bug. She\u2019s signed Suri up for one-on-one acting classes with an acting coach and she\u2019s getting private singing and music classes too,\u201d the insider added.\n\nA post shared by Suri Cruise Holmes ???? (@suricruise.official) on Aug 22, 2018 at 9:32am PDT\n\nAs a daughter of two very popular actors, it should not be difficult for Suri to find inspirations leading to her dream of becoming an actress as well. But Hollywood Life\u2019s source claimed that the young lady started wanting to become an actress when she visited the set of \u201cThe Kennedys: After Camelot.\u201d Holmes played the late Jackie Kennedy in the 2017 miniseries.\n\nThe insider stated further that Suri Cruise was fascinated with how the actors prepared for their scenes, especially with their \u201chair, makeup and wardrobe.\u201d It is not strange for children of popular actors to follow their parents\u2019 legacy. And the report claimed that Katie Holmes is totally on board with Suri\u2019s dream. However, Tom Cruise reportedly thinks his daughter is still quite young to be starting an acting career.\n\nIn other news, there has been a recent spike in the number of published rumors that Tom Cruise is fighting to get custody of his 12-year-old daughter. The reports also said that the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d actor is trying to win back Suri by showering her with gifts aside from his alleged renewed efforts in court.\n\nRecently, it was also reported that Suri Cruise had been \u201cbegging\u201d her mom Katie Holmes to ditch her relationship with boyfriend Jamie Foxx. There were recent claims that Suri does not approve of how the singer-actor treats the 39-year-old \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d alum.\n\nA post shared by Suri Cruise Holmes ???? (@suricruise.official) on Aug 21, 2018 at 9:16am PDT\n\nLuckily, rumor fact-checking outlet Gossip Cop has debunked these stories. The site calls out tabloids spreading reports about Tom Cruise\u2019s recent efforts to take his daughter from Holmes. Gossip Cop even suggested that the so-called insiders are merely \u201cguessing and speculating\" after dissecting their quoted statements.\n\nMeanwhile, Gossip Cop also debunked the story that Suri Cruise does not like Foxx due to allegations that he continuously flirts with other women \u2014 another story that has also been repeatedly refuted. Holmes\u2019 spokespersons did not comment on this rumor but Gossip Cop said that a \u201cconfidante\u201d of Holmes already denied these claims.", "images": ["https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnLinkedIn.svg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190712d30a4301fde769b72_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190710aeeaeed50db9828fd_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/main/icnMenuWhite.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/201907111ce32ae5a406cac1b_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnComments.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/201907119578f607d9d50ff6a_th_70x46.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/201907126e1439be1064862b8_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/main/icnSearchWhite.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/btnClose_v2.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/ad/imgGoogle270.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnTextPlus.svg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnTextMinus.svg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190712d28fb60db0efd3ef3_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190711b1840b56af233c119_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnReddit.svg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190712ff4bad05abbcc8e7a_th_70x46.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/201907121b7b5e334e2f4c353_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnFacebook.svg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190710fba6db255a159f9ba_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/icnNavArrow.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnSaveForLater.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/2019071282bc7564e8098c0e2_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnGooglePlus.svg", "https://www.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/2019040725253d8d74f6b92a4_th_192x136.jpg", "https://www.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190419bcbd38777508124e0_th_192x136.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/2019071105394402d15fd8d9b_th_57x70.jpg", "http://in.getclicky.com/100822552ns.gif", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190710aa8ff5b3c6eec5d2a_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/btnClose_v3.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/2019071293bebe2abdc42789d_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnTwiiter.svg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190711f309fddd9ceeda41b_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/201907125e06619880dc8c378_th_70x46.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/icnArrowDown.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/imgLogoSmall.svg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190711b8176d6e0403c04aa_th_70x46.jpeg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-Lwyc-38JxASeL.gif", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/201907127561001c12785c581_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190710ccbd3f606705c4738_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/2019071199c972baa7b5006ce_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20180824c7d4be0e8fdec1c5d_th_1024x0.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190710eab8d78214641822b_th_57x70.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/2019071255eb20b81cd59836c_th_70x46.jpg", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20190712667d05a3df90d35b1_th_70x46.png", "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/view/icnPinterest.svg"], "top_img": "https://s1.econotimes.com/assets/uploads/20180824c7d4be0e8fdec1c5d_th_1024x0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.econotimes.com/Suri-Cruise-2018-Wants-to-Start-Acting-Career-Reports-on-Tom-Cruise-Custody-Disapproval-of-Katie-Holmes-Boyfriend-Debunked-1419882", "title": "Suri Cruise 2018: 12-Year-Old Wants to Start Acting Career?;
