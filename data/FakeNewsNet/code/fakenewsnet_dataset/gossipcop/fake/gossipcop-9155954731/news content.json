I did not know this man. I have never had a conversation with him, ever.\"\n\nVenit has represented stars such as Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, Sylvester Stallone, Diane Keaton, Liam Hemsworth and Steve Martin.\n\nCharley Gallay/Getty Images\n\nCrews was with his wife, Rebecca King-Crews, at the party last year when, he claims, Venit began making moves with his tongue at him.\n\n\"I'm looking like, 'Is this a joke?' ... It was actually so bizarre,\" Crews said. \"He comes over to me. I stick my hand out, and he literally takes his hand and puts it and squeezes my genitals. I jump back like, 'Hey, hey.'\"\n\nCrews continued, \"And he's still licking his tongue out and all this stuff, and I go, 'Dude, what are you doing? What are you doing?' and then he comes back again. He just won't stop.\"\n\nCrews claims he then pushed Venit away from him, causing Venit to bump into other partygoers.\n\n\"I have never felt more emasculated, more objectified. I was horrified,\" Crews said. \"It's so bizarre. I wake up every morning wondering, 'Did this really happen?'\"\n\nVenit did not respond to requests for comment from ABC News.\n\nWilliam Morris Endeavor told ABC News, \"Adam Venit was suspended following the internal investigation into the matter.\"\n\nCrews filed a police report Nov. 8 claiming to be a victim of a crime.\n\n\"People need to be held accountable,\" he said. \"This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he's one of the most powerful man in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, 'Who is going to believe you?'\"\n\nAn LAPD spokesperson confirmed that Crews met with officers on Nov. 8 but would not elaborate on the nature of the meeting.\n\nCrews, a star of \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" fired William Morris as his agency one day after he filed the police report.\n\nABC\n\nHe went public with his account last month in a series of tweets, at the time identifying Venit only as \"a high level Hollywood executive.\"\n\nCrews said in one tweet that Venit called him to apologize but \"never really explained why he did what he did.\"\n\nThis whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME. (1/Cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nMy wife n I were at a Hollywood function last year n a high level Hollywood executive came over 2 me and groped my privates. (2/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nJumping back I said What are you doing?! My wife saw everything n we looked at him like he was crazy. He just grinned like a jerk. (3/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nThat night and the next day I talked to everyone I knew that worked with him about what happened. (7/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nHe called me the next day with an apology but never really explained why he did what he did. (8/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\n'I understand why they won't come forward'\n\nCrews said he went public with the alleged incident after multiple women came forward to accuse now-disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"I put it in the back of my head, and I understood why women everywhere had to let it go,\" Crews said. \"When the Weinstein thing started happening, I got PTSD. I was going, 'Oh, my God, this exact thing happened to me. I understand why they won't come forward.'\"\n\nWeinstein, 65, has admitted wrongdoing but through a spokesperson has repeatedly denied having nonconsensual sexual relations with accusers.\n\nCrews compared being abused by a person in power to being a war captive.\n\n\"When a person of power breaks that boundary and violates that boundary, you're a prisoner of war,\" he said. \"Immediately, you're in a camp because you're trying to figure out when is the right time to come out.\"\n\n\"This the thing that a lot of people just don't understand, and they end up blaming the victim,\" he said. \"I have totally said I will not be shamed. I will not be shamed. I did nothing wrong. Nothing.\"\n\nCrews credited his wife with keeping him calm after the alleged assault.\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty Images\n\n\"My wife told me three years earlier, she said, 'Terry, you can never handle any situation like this with violence. You are a target. You are going to be baited and pulled if you react physically,'\" he said. \"When I grabbed her hand and I left that party \u2014 we were only there for, like, half an hour \u2014 and I got in the car, I almost ripped the steering wheel off.\"\n\n\"If I would have just retaliated in defense, I would be under the jail right now. That's one thing I knew, that being a large African-American man in America, I would immediately be seen as a thug,\" he added. \"But I'm not a thug. I'm an artist.\"\n\nCrews, a father of five, said he was also motivated to speak publicly after delivering a keynote address for an organization that helps victims of sexual assault.\n\n\"I said, 'Man, what kind of man would I be to tell my kids, 'If someone touches you where you don't want to be touched, tell someone, tell someone,' and then I don't do it?\" he said. \"Let me tell you something, it freed me.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I knew instantly that I had to tell my story so that other people could be free.\"\n\nCrews posted a tweet with just the hashtag #imfree after his appearance on \"GMA.\"\n\nABC News' Alex Stone and Lesley Messer contributed to this report.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/terry-crews-rebecca-king-crews-gty-mem-171115_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/terry-crews1-gma-mem-171115_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/terry-crews1-gma-mem-171115_4x3_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/adam-venit-gty-mem-171115_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/terry-crews1-gma-mem-171115_31x13_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/terry-crews1-gma-mem-171115_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Katie Kindelan", "Sabina Ghebremedhin"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/terry-crews-names-alleged-sexual-assaulter-shamed/story?id=51146972", "title": "Terry Crews names alleged sexual assaulter: 'I will not be shamed'", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
