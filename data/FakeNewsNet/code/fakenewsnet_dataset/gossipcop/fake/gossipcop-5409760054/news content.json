In recent weeks, both Kim Kardashian and her younger sister, Kylie Jenner have welcomed new baby girls after super secret pregnancies. Add in the fact that middle-sister Khloe is also pregnant and expecting her first child in early April, according to her Twitter, and the Kardashian clan couldn\u2019t be happier. Still, you\u2019ve heard the saying \u2018when it rains it pours.\u2019 Sure enough, ENews\u2019 sneak peeks of the newest episode airing this Sunday, February 25 show Kourtney dishing to her sisters about a potential little cousin for brand new babies, Chicago and Stormi. So, straight up: Is Kourtney Kardashian pregnant? Is she really going to freeze her eggs?\n\nWhile there are no confirmations at this point that Kourtney Kardashian is pregnant, Kourtney\u2019s own words suggest she\u2019s got baby number four on her mind. And we know KUWTK crews film episodes several weeks to months before they air. Spoiler videos for this Sunday\u2019s episode, \u201cTrimester Trouble,\u201d reveal Kourtney\u2019s plan to freeze her eggs as \u201cinsurance,\u201d that she can have a fourth child in the future. So will we know at the end of this episode if Kourtney\u2019s going to freeze her eggs?\n\nKourtney also revealed that she uses an IUD as birth control with her current boyfriend, model, Younes Bendjima, 24. Adding, however, that she wouldn\u2019t mind taking it out if her partner wanted children in the near term. It seems that the Kardashian women are on a pregnancy roll. But what about the boys, or should we say, Kardashian Kastoffs?\n\nKardashian Exes Talk Babies and New Boyfriends\n\nKhloe\u2019s ex-husband, Lamar Odom discloses in a not-yet-aired interview with Access Hollywood, that he\u2019s happy for Khloe about her pregnancy with new boyfriend, Cavaliers player, Tristan Thompson. Lamar can be heard saying that, \u201cit couldn\u2019t happen to a better person,\u201d US Magazine reports. Still, he admits hearing the bombshell Khloe divulged in the season 13 finale, that she was only \u201cfake trying\u201d to get pregnant while she was married to him, was \u201churtful.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Kylie\u2019s famous on-again-off-again ex-boyfriend, Tyga had good things to say about Kylie and her new baby. He told radio interviewer, DJ Akademiks that, \u201cthere\u2019s no bad blood, no problems.\u201d And while the 28-year-old rapper didn\u2019t comment on Stormi specifically during this interview, he did admit that he and Kylie still \u201ccommunicate.\u201d And that did nothing to squash internet rumors that Tyga may be the biological father of the 20-year-old cosmetics mogul\u2019s new daughter.\n\nAnd what about Kourtney\u2019s ex and baby-daddy, Scott Disick? The man who got Kourtney Kardashian pregnant three times in the past is plenty busy hitting the town with new girlfriend, 19-year-old Sophia Richie, younger daughter of Lionel Richie. And on the Rob Kardashian front, there\u2019s not much news yet. Momager Kris\u2019s only son, Rob, has not found love again. At least not after his much-publicized breakup with Blac Chyna, the mother of one-year-old Dream Kardashian. But with all these new babies on the scene, who has time to date?", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 27 44'%3E%3Cpath d='M0 22L22 0l2.1 2.1L4.2 22l19.9 19.9L22 44 0 22z' fill='%23ffffff'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-866712728-780x410.jpg", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/secondnexus_logo_sticky.png", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/second-nexus-logo.svg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-BuK7Wa2WM15M6.gif", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oh-myyy-ribbon.svg", "https://secondnexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-866712728.jpg", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-25-at-7.23.55-PM-e1519606098139-150x150.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c896c5b43fca8ab312ccb12ab56880f2?s=64&d=%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F2n-favicon-150x150.png&r=g"], "top_img": "https://secondnexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-866712728.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://secondnexus.com/entertainment/kourtney-kardashian-baby-four-pregnancy/", "title": "Is Kourtney Kardashian Pregnant or Planning for a New Baby Too?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Is Kourtney Kardashian pregnant too?
