What is going onnnnn! #DWTS #TeamBabiesAndBallroom \u2014 Felicia (@bwaybaby629) October 17, 2017\n\nWhile some fans said you could \u201ccut the tension\u201d between the two, Chmerkovskiy, 37, and Lachey, 36 actually appeared to be a very loving pair behind the scenes during the live show.\n\nDuring the commercial break before their performance, Lachey and Chmerkovskiy both took time to chat with Lachey\u2019s two older children, who were sitting in the front row before Chmerkovskiy led Lachey to the middle of the ballroom to rehearse their dance.\n\nAfter running though the routine, Lachey went back over to her children. Chmerkovksiy jokingly slid by a few minutes later, making Lachey giggle before they got into their place as the show picked up after the commercials.\n\nImage zoom\n\nPEOPLE\u2019s special issue 25 Seasons of \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 is on stands now\n\nAfter they received their scores (24/30), fans continued to comment on their demeanor, calling it \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\n\nWow Maks & Vanessa look straight up uncomfortable & irritated at each other\u2026 \ud83d\udc40 #DWTS \u2014 Ashley Chamberlain (@AshleyChamberla) October 17, 2017\n\nBut when the cameras stopped rolling, Chmerkovskiy was seen comforting Lachey, who seemingly had been hoping for higher scores.\n\nI\u2019m starting to believe the rumor about Maks & Vanessa not getting along\u2026 #DWTS \u2014 PerfectEnigma (@PerfectEnigma) October 17, 2017\n\nDespite sources telling PEOPLE that things have been tense in the rehearsal room, Lachey relied on Chmerkovskiy for comfort during Monday\u2019s emotional elimination.\n\nWhen it was announced that her husband, Nick Lachey, was not in jeopardy of elimination for the first time in three weeks, she threw herself into Chmerkovskiy\u2019s arms. He enveloped her and held her until the entire cast moved to say goodbye to Gleb Savchenko and Sasha Pieterse.\n\nChmerkovskiy and Lachey will return Monday (8 p.m. ET) to the ballroom for Movie Night on the ABC reality dance competition.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/66479204_108888670282730_6022764772832245612_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C191px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3fa541db8026dac32c501e873a116a3c?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/zendayaeuphoria.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2866px%2C1504.65px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/boyce-gma-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/james_holzhauer.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/flintstone-social.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-152261392.jpg?w=1024", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tori-spelling-2-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/million1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/maks-chmerkovskiy.jpg?crop=404px%2C27px%2C1229px%2C645px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jordyn-woods.jpg?crop=0px%2C264px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/beth-chapman-dog-bounty-hunter-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2026px%2C1063.65px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/al-roker-glasses.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2584px%2C1358px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/sophie-perry-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/millions2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/6-helen-sloan-hbo.jpg?crop=0px%2C56px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/62495663_119080772678623_6620253245636125480_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C377px%2C2414px%2C1268px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bella-chigvintsev-2-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/jenelle-evans.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jenelle-evans.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/60258869_144858413341667_1225242940087715373_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C176px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/charo.jpg?crop=13px%2C25px%2C731px%2C383px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/dwts1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/maks-chmerkovskiy.jpg?crop=404px%2C27px%2C1229px%2C645px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Gomez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/dwts-what-you-didnt-see-maks-chmerkovskiy-vanessa-lachey/", "title": "DWTS: Maks Chmerkovskiy & Vanessa Lachey's Behind the Scenes Interactions", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "vanessa lachey, maks chmerkovskiy, maks and vanessa, dwts, dancing with the stars, maks chmerkovskiy and vanessa lachey", "news_keywords": "vanessa lachey, maks chmerkovskiy, maks and vanessa, dwts, dancing with the stars, maks chmerkovskiy and vanessa lachey", "description": "PEOPLE goes inside the ballroom and behind the scenes with Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Vanessa Lachey", "og": {"title": "What You Didn't See at DWTS: How Maks Chmerkovskiy &amp;
