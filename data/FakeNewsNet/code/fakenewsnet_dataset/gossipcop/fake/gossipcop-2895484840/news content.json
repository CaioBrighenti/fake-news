Once Hollywood\u2019s ultimate social butterfly, the pop star has remained mysteriously out of the spotlight this year \u2014 way out. Other than her July court hearing to testify against the DJ who was convicted of groping her, she hasn\u2019t made any public appearances in nearly nine months. Paparazzi have only gotten glimpses of her, bundled in hoodies and dashing into cars with her new boyfriend, British actor Joe Alwyn, 26.

But a source says her self-inflicted sequestration is only spurring more curiosity: \u201cTaylor grew tired of people over analyzing her life and passing judgment on her, but being so conspicuously absent from the Hollywood scene just has everyone wondering what\u2019s going on with her.\u201d\n\nWHERE THE GIRLS AT?\n\nEven members of Taylor\u2019s famed \u201csquad\u201d have indicated that she\u2019s not as prese", "images": ["http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bxslider/4.2.5/images/bx_loader.gif", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1560366743/images/thumb/OK_June242019.jpg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1562172466/images/thumb/OK_July152019.jpg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1560973466/images/thumb/OK_July12019.jpg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1557947339/images/thumb/OK_May272019.jpg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1558554604/images/thumb/OK_June32019.jpg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1556098864/images/thumb/OK_May62019.jpg", "http://magarticles.magzter.com/articles/3406/246733/59ddaf81b0f17/Taylors-Lonely-Life.jpeg", "http://reseuro.magzter.com/882x1606/articles/3406/246733/59ddaf81b0f17/Taylors-Lonely-Life.jpeg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1561560002/images/thumb/OK_July82019.jpg", "http://akcdn.magzter.com/web/assets/images/closeBtn.png", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1556809531/images/thumb/OK_May132019.jpg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1559737075/images/thumb/OK_June172019.jpg", "https://akcdn.magzter.com/web/assets/images/gs-gold-logo.png", "http://akcdn.magzter.com/web/magzter-articles.png", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1562765796/images/thumb/OK_July222019.jpg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1559146880/images/thumb/OK_June102019.jpg", "http://rse.magzter.com/250x300/1368736628/1557346113/images/thumb/OK_May202019.jpg"], "top_img": "http://magarticles.magzter.com/articles/3406/246733/59ddaf81b0f17/Taylors-Lonely-Life.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.magzter.com/articles/3406/246733/59ddaf81b0f17", "title": "Taylor's Lonely Life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Taylor's Lonely Life, recent article from OK!
