For years, it\u2019s been rumored that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have had troubles in their marriage \u2014 but an insider tells In Touch exclusively that the pair, who have been married since 2008, are officially at their breaking point, and divorce is officially inevitable.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to make it. Their roller-coaster marriage is about to derail,\u201d the insider tells the magazine.\n\nThe reason they have held off until this point isn\u2019t a coincidence: Next August marks 10 years since they tied the knot, and after making it a decade together, California law could mean Portia is entitled to more of Ellen\u2019s money (Ellen is worth an estimated $360 million, compared to Portia\u2019s $20 million fortune). Should Ellen want to protect herself (and her estate), she would need to end their union before the big anniversary come August. But it\u2019s unlikely that that\u2019ll happen \u2014 as Ellen was the one hoping to make things work. The insider adds, \u201c[Ellen\u2019s] friends know she would do whatever it takes to stay married to Portia, and she has. They\u2019ve gone to individual and couples counseling.\u201d\n\nOf course, it isn\u2019t surprising that Ellen, 59, isn\u2019t as keen to divorce as her wife, 44; according to the insider, her controllng ways played a huge role in their crumbling relationship. \u201cEllen is a control freak, and she prety much micromanages Portia\u2019s personal and professional life,\u201d the insider explains, adding that Portia is far from innocent. \u201cEllen is tired of being told to change this and change that about herself. It\u2019s a sad situation. Ellen doesn\u2019t want to get a divorce. She\u2019s a romantic.\u201d\n\nWith the potential trouble looming around the \u201c10-year rule,\u201d as it\u2019s known informally in California, the legal battle looming ahead is likely to be an ugly one. And the personal battle will be just as ugly for their loved ones and fans. The insider laments, \u201cNo one wants to see them split up.\u201d\n\nFor more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch \u2014 and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-divorce.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Matt-Lauer-Divorce.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-divorce.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/matt-lauer-annette.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mike-and-Laura-Fleiss.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/realronniemagro_65234596_201850050805475_1976547706221271105_n.jpg?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-divorce.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carly Sitzer", "Dec"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-divorce-149568/", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Are \u201cAt Their Breaking Point\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "They can no longer even pretend to make it work.
