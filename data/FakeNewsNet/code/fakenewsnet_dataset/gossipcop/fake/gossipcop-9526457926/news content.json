The show is the original show in the Flip or Flop franchise. The show was renewed for an eighth season which will premiere on August 1, 2019.[2]\n\nPremise [ edit ]\n\nThe El Moussas were both real estate agents prior to the crash in 2008, and later they began flipping homes, mostly in Orange County, California.\n\nIn 2011, Tarek asked a friend to help him make an audition tape for HGTV. The friend filmed an entire episode of the process of house flipping from start to finish. The audition tape was sent to HGTV, and they were interested in talking to the couple. In 2012, HGTV signed the couple to a regular weekly program that shows the process of buying distressed property and renovating it.[3]\n\nChristina's expertise is primarily in design, and she works with Tarek to find and renovate homes. She handles the designs of the new spaces and keeps everything on schedule. The show follows them as they buy homes, typically bank-owned, short sales or foreclosures, to renovate and resell.[4]\n\nHosts [ edit ]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nTarek El Moussa was born on August 21, 1981. He was born and raised in Long Beach, California, to a Moroccan father and an American mother of European ancestry. He earned his real estate license at age 21. Tarek met his future wife, Christina Meursinge Haack, while working in the real estate industry. The couple married in 2009 and they have two children, a girl named Taylor Reese and a boy named Brayden James.[5] They are partners on the HGTV show Flip or Flop. The couple were selling real estate in the Southern California area[6] when the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash; they went from living in a $6,000 per month home to a $700 per month apartment.[7]\n\nIn 2013, a registered nurse and viewer, Ryan Reade, contacted the network after seeing a lump on Tarek's neck during a Flip or Flop marathon. Tarek had previously had the lump examined, and he said there was no issue. After Reade contacted producers, Tarek had the lump checked again; doctors discovered that he had stage 3 thyroid cancer.[8] The El Moussas thanked Reade in a video that can be seen on HGTV.com.[9]\n\nIn May 2016, the couple secretly split due to \"challenges\" in their marriage.[10] In January 2017, Tarek officially filed for divorce from Christina.[11]\n\nReal estate career [ edit ]\n\nTarek and Christina ran a real-estate agency, The El Moussa Group, in Orange County, California, an area with one of the largest foreclosure rates in the country. Tarek, Christina, and their partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment house in Santa Ana for $115,000. After selling the property for a profit of $34,000, the trio split the money and continued to flip houses, expanding their real estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada.[12]\n\nSeries overview [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 13 April 16, 2013 ( ) May 28, 2013 ( 2013-05-28 ) 2 14 April 8, 2014 ( ) July 8, 2014 ( 2014-07-08 ) 3 15 October 7, 2014 ( ) July 7, 2015 ( 2015-07-07 ) 4 15 December 3, 2015 ( ) March 24, 2016 ( 2016-03-24 ) 5 15 June 9, 2016 ( ) September 22, 2016 ( 2016-09-22 ) 6 15 December 1, 2016 ( ) March 30, 2017 ( 2017-03-30 ) 7 20 June 15, 2017 ( ) September 6, 2018 ( 2018-09-06 )\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Flip_or_Flop_Logo.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/14/Flip_or_Flop_Logo.jpg/250px-Flip_or_Flop_Logo.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Ambox_current_red.svg/42px-Ambox_current_red.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Flip_or_Flop_Logo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_or_Flop", "title": "Flip or Flop", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.34.0-wmf.13", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Flip_or_Flop_Logo.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
