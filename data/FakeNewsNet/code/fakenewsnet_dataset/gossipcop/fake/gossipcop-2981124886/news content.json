Now that baby Stormi is four months old, she's starting to show more defined features in her face and sources exclusively revealed to In Touch that there is a part of Travis that is starting to doubt Stormi's paternity and whether or not he is the little girl's father.\n\n\"Travis is starting to get a little worried and questioning Kylie about this whole bodyguard situation.

He loves Stormi and truly believes that's his daughter but can't help but notice that she doesn't look like him. In the back of his mind he wonders if Kylie strayed.
