Not even close.\n\nAnd while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they\u2019re as diva as you might expect.\n\nLopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.\n\nSo what is this magic phrase?\n\n\u201cI am youthful and timeless at every age,\u201d Lopez says every single day\u2014but it\u2019s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. \u201cI tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clich\u00e9d bullshit, but it\u2019s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.\u201d\n\nLopez continues, \u201cThe affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they\u2019re all here. They\u2019re just part of the house now.\u201d\n\nBefore you scoff at Lopez\u2019s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.\n\nThe book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that \u201cwhen pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.\u201d\n\nAnd really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.\n\nSo what\u2019s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.", "images": ["https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/billie_cover1_web-3.jpg?w=1024", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/0ce1a66fe4ebc7869509a2d83c5e822b", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-mobile-e28093-640-png-1.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/faea91c672d21fa302591fd7c6b14a51", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-desktop-1000x56-png-1.png", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a08a8064a8de23a7a38411a6a58c7281", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/app-store.png", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-rh-column-300x300-png-1.png", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red-mobile.svg", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/df27f23c149265c16b58a79de392b7c8", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2953d27c2f54cc587cfdd5c73c34928d", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/nav-close.png", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2baac0756778082e954bc41f8dd2914c", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4dbac34c3574d5b162316bf6a9f4e5d3", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/39aadabd9813a84848c02a86da0bfe0a", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red.svg", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dfd972e23f8a6fb58d3bf7a4d45e4b39", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c80d6d92ce4b9fc383025d993428e837", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/18c21cdc0b2b87125c9c6dccee62afe1", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2f49bd72032d9fd03912876fe06fc38f", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d4486543dc07e0112ccaaee2fe1433e8", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80bf4d4f4840daab4f18df57aa7ee0a5", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/google-play.png", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/630afbbd3c27f032f8e69fa6078034be", "http://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/vogue-au-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f7aef56bf5aa3e4d4f8138e45413757c", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2c94ab79587484e2b1982eaffa7042b0"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/630afbbd3c27f032f8e69fa6078034be", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lilith Hardie Lupica"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com.au/beauty/skin/jennifer-lopezs-secret-to-staying-youthful-is-a-mantra-embroidered-on-her-pillowcase/news-story/a37cd664e0f117e02cee8a20b5046ff3", "title": "Jennifer Lopez's secret to staying youthful is a mantra embroidered on her pillowcase", "meta_data": {"author": "Lilith Hardie Lupica", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue Australia", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lopez's secret to staying youthful is a mantra embroidered on her pillowcase", "description": "Jenny and her silk pillowcases.", "url": "https://www.vogue.com.au/beauty/skin/jennifer-lopezs-secret-to-staying-youthful-is-a-mantra-embroidered-on-her-pillowcase/news-story/a37cd664e0f117e02cee8a20b5046ff3", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=200", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"creator": {"identifier": "vogueaustralia", "id": "vogueaustralia_id"}, "title": "Jennifer Lopez's secret to staying youthful is a mantra embroidered on her pillowcase", "description": "Jenny and her silk pillowcases.", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=240", "src": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/630afbbd3c27f032f8e69fa6078034be"}, "site": "@wordpressdotcom", "text": {"title": "Jennifer Lopez\u2019s secret to staying youthful is a mantra embroidered on her\u00a0pillowcase"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=270", "theme-color": "#000000", "google-site-verification": "1j07G6Nu2IDJrC-g23wwzTEjb-d0Va1h15olpbRuxYI", "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-22T03:48:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-22T03:53:40+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "application-name": "Vogue Australia", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Vogue -
