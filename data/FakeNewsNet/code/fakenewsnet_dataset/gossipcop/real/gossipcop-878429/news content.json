News.\n\n\u201cI got a new debit card last month and got an email from an ex this morning, forwarding me an email that his Disneyland Annual Pass payment was declined & to update my card info\u2026I sure know how to pick em,\u201d she wrote in the since-deleted message, according to the outlet.\n\nClaiming he wanted to clarify the situation, Hayes replied with screenshots of their private e-mail correspondence.\n\n\u201cLol is this how it happened or was I was trying to help you poor thing? Let\u2019s evaluate below everyone \ud83d\ude42 (Read the whole thing),\u201d he wrote alongside images of their exchange.\n\nLol is this how it happened or was I was trying to help you poor thing?

Up to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBTW\u2026Nice new tits,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOh thanks Robby, You\u2019re just a gem, as usual,\u201d she responded.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

News, Stanton said that she had been \u201csurprised\u201d to receive the e-mail from her ex.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t spoke since the reunion show. I tweeted it before I heard his response email because I did think it was a little funny he was contacting me about his Disneyland pass\u2026but I never said who it was about or even hinted at it being about him or had any intention to,\u201d she continued, adding that she had \u201cfully moved on\u201d and wished \u201cnothing but happiness and peace for him.\u201d\n\nShe seemingly addressed the incident on social media as well, writing, \u201cSome people don\u2019t even deserve your time\u2026 \u201d\n\nSome people don't even deserve your time\u2026 \u263a\ufe0f \u2014 Amanda Stanton (@amandastantonnn) April 11, 2018\n\nThe pair previously got into a heated exchange on social media following the Bachelor in Paradise finale last year, when they both discussed allegations that he cheated.\n\nAfter Hayes fiercely denied that he had been unfaithful, Stanton tweeted the alleged photo proof of Hayes\u2019 infidelity, quoting Taylor Swift in the process: \u201cLook what you made me do,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cI have plenty more + videos,\u201d she added. \u201cPlus multiple girls have came out and DM\u2019d me with stories since\u2026etc etc.\u201d\n\nLook what you made me do \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/5TCuv8Xtj4 \u2014 Amanda Stanton (@amandastantonnn) September 12, 2017\n\nI have plenty more + videos. Plus multiple girls have came out and DM'd me with stories since\u2026etc etc. \u2014 Amanda Stanton (@amandastantonnn) September 12, 2017\n\nStanton previously opened up to PEOPLE about why she decided to end her relationship with Hayes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the kind of person, when I\u2019m into someone, I put all my effort into that,\u201d she added. \u201cSo we tried it out, and I think we just have different ideas of what a relationship is like. Like, certain things that just come naturally in a relationship, like checking in with that person, answering when I call. There were photos of him with another girl. It became too much for me.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Paul Hebert/ABC via Getty\n\nThough the relationship was real both on and off camera, Stanton said that after the show, \u201call he wanted to do is party and not call me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done with all the Bachelor shows,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m glad I came back this season, but I\u2019m done.\u201d", "images":
