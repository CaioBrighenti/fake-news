She\u2019s handled Trooping the Colour, as well as her first \u201coff-site\u201d day trip with the Queen, and on Tuesday, Meghan arrived at her first Royal Ascot, the formal carriage procession that marks the beginning of a five-day racing extravaganza in Berkshire.\n\nMeghan arrived for the festivities in a carriage along with Prince Harry (donning a top hat), Prince Edward, and Countess Sophie, with Meghan spotted \u201csharing a joke\u201d with Sophie as they made their way onto the premises. (It\u2019s always amusing how even the slightest whispered aside at these events, when everyone is watching, become used as proof of a great convivial bond.)\n\nMeghan again wore a Givenchy look, after working with the designer for both her wedding and her dress for her day with the Queen. And, as she has for nearly all her major events since becoming a royal, Meghan decided to wear a dress in the white-cream-beige family, as she chose a white collared dress, accessorized with a white and black Philip Treacy hat. (A royal correspondent for The Sun deemed the look \u201cAudrey Hepburn-esque.\u201d)", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d264c82540eab0008cafee1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-polo-outing.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59af017eaf6a6649ac72d6d0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss08.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b290e837cb1b26becdcc006/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Markle-Monochrome-Givenchy.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_80%2Cc_limit/josh-duboff-square.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825f472d37f5e2f7265/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d08fb1e28d8ad4721470bbf/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kate-middleton-ascot.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968254a3663211bf43089/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b290e826163e4725653cbbb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meghan-Markle-Monochrome-Givenchy.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d09080ca2036c4810753edd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/queen-elizabeth-royal-ascot-turnout.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b241584a84e0e7a3df098e1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Reception-Dress-for-Sale-McCartney.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b290e826163e4725653cbbb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meghan-Markle-Monochrome-Givenchy.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Josh Duboff", "Katie Nicholl", "Josh Dubof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/06/meghan-markle-royal-ascot-debut-givenchy-prince-harry", "title": "Meghan Markle Makes Her Royal Ascot Debut in Monochrome Givenchy", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Meghan continues working with the designer for her latest major appearance.", "keywords": "Meghan Markle,Prince Harry", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Meghan continues working with the designer for her latest major appearance.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b290e826163e4725653cbbb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meghan-Markle-Monochrome-Givenchy.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Meghan Markle Makes Her Royal Ascot Debut in Monochrome Givenchy", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/06/meghan-markle-royal-ascot-debut-givenchy-prince-harry"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Meghan continues working with the designer for her latest major appearance.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b290e826163e4725653cbbb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meghan-Markle-Monochrome-Givenchy.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Meghan Markle Makes Her Royal Ascot Debut in Monochrome Givenchy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
