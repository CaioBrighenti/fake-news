SAVE NOW\n\nYou take a seemingly derivative show premise (cough, \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d) and customize it according to the idea that \u201cthis charming goof of a man-child (who needs a haircut) is popular, his star continues to rise at this network, we know there\u2019s something even more Hollywood-y we could do with him and this, uhhh, is what we came up with.\u201d\n\nThen you film the filming of that goof \u2014 a guy who is wholly unprepared for this and clearly trying with all his might to hold onto his integrity and own sense of authenticity \u2014 and you document his life as he navigates through pre-fabbed relationships and camera-driven interactions specifically designed to heighten whatever lust, tension and jealousy have been mustered.\n\nI might be overthinking it, but last night, after Shep Rose realized that \u201cdating five women who live together\u201d actually means \u201cdating five women who live together,\u201d he became Jim Halpert from \u201cThe Office,\u201d Valerie Cherish from \u201cThe Comeback\u201d and Chris Traeger from \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d all at once.\n\nHe was awkward, proud, exhausted, wry, self-aware, committed, professional, clueless, open-minded, inept, sincere, shy, human, smarter than the rest of the room, emotionally dopey, ego-driven, self-deprecating, frightened, sexed up, gentlemanly and always appearing as though his actions were subconsciously timing themselves to the cadence of his inside voice whispering \u201cWhat are you doing, Shep? What are you doing, Shep?\u201d\n\nAt any given moment last night, it seemed like he was about bolt off-camera and start banging at the sky to find his way out of this alternate universe where he is surrounded by women telling him it\u2019s time to get serious.\n\nI\u2019m just saying this is how it seems. I have no insight into the situation. I\u2019m merely reporting what I see on the screen, which is a man who really didn\u2019t appear to understand that women who live together and who date the same guy at the very same time will absolutely kiss and tell and make things difficult for him.\n\nMeaning, if you send a freaking dumb meme to one of them, Shepard Rose, you better meme them all or be absolutely prepared to ask the question \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d all night in rounds of five.\n\nSpeaking of, now that we\u2019re in the \u201ccompetition\u201d phase of the show, let\u2019s look at the winners from last night\u2019s episode.\n\nThis is easy because there are only three:\n\n\u2014 Sarah the Producer, because she cliff-hung us all at the end there (By the way, if Shep\u2019s anti-dolphin rhetoric was foreshadowing that this sixth mystery-surprise woman is Landon ... deep breath ... let\u2019s not think this way just yet. Positive vibes, everyone)\n\n\u2014 Roger the Trolley Driver for keeping it real about his alleged lack of history knowledge\n\n\u2014 Austen, because how cute was he last night? This guy went from \u201cwho and why?\u201d on \u201cSouthern Charm\u201d last season to \u201cThank God! It\u2019s Austen. PLEASE DON\u2019T GO ANYWHERE! These women are starting to catch on!\u201d in \u201cRelationShep.\u201d\n\nLosers, in this order, are:\n\n\u2014 Arden: If she were an item of clothing, she would be the extra pair of Hanes Her Way your mom wants you to keep in your purse \u201cjust in case.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kylie: This is Bravo, not TLC. Also, you skipped college graduation for this, which fine, we all make compromises for our careers. KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF, THOUGH, KYLIE. There is no way to look at that fact about you and not be like \u201cShe skipped graduation to compete for the love of a reality star 15 years her senior? What is this girl up to?\u201d Oh wait. Is this maybe some sort of pre-run audition for her own show in the future? Like a \u201cTex in the City\u201d or a \u201cYee-Hawt\u201d?\n\n\u2014 Peyton: Yes to that flamingo-float-standing contest. And a big no no no to showing Austen a brand of lady-craze best kept under the hood. There is a rule, Peyton: You can\u2019t pretend to be the cool girl and then go into a verbal version of Carrie Mathison\u2019s living room wall terrorist chart to explain Shep\u2019s uneven distribution of DMs. YAHCANT. Or at least you shouldn\u2019t ... not if you want to be on the winners list with Roger, anyway.\n\nHere are some other thoughts on the third episode of \u201cRelationShep\u201d on Monday night:\n\n\u25aa That beach house mansion on Kiawah Island is extra. I hope no one poops on the elevator.\n\n\u25aa Cameran! OK. Mixed feelings on this one. First, she was wearing the romper she bought at It\u2019s Retail Therapy in Beaufort last spring so that was cool. Second, I always welcome scenes in which she orders the entire menu. But what the heck was that at the beach house mansion? People on Twitter were super excited that she asked Kylie about having vegetarian-related gas and that she told Peyton she looks like a Nordic alien. But Cameran was harsh and kind of ... I don\u2019t know, racist? I don\u2019t even know the word for it. Like calm down, Cam, Priscila is from Brazil, not the future. You don\u2019t need to keep talking about her heritage like it\u2019s the only fact to know about her. And you certainly don\u2019t need to say things like \u201cI asked about your butt\u201d because \u201call Brazilians\u201d have nice ones. When she asked Priscila if she wears a thong (as alllllllll Brazilians do in Cameran\u2019s world, apparently), I wish Priscila had responded \u201cJust for your dad.\u201d Oh and Shep too! He totally called Priscila fiery again which ... she\u2019s a person, you maniacs, and this is real life, not \u201cInternational Night\u201d in your boarding school cafeteria. I\u2019m surprised Cameran and Shep weren\u2019t like \u201cAh, yes. Brazil. I know it well. For instance, the capital is Brasilia, the girl ... she was from Ipanema ... and I\u2019ve been to your steakhouse.\u201d\n\n\u25aa I wonder if Kylie, Peyton, Bella, Arden and Priscila watched last night\u2019s episode, saw Shep\u2019s energetic response to the food he and Cameran ate at Hominy Grill, listened to him moan in abject pleasure at the mere sight of his gooey dessert, witnessed him talk kind of dirty to it, and thought to themselves, \u201cIf you love it so much, why don\u2019t you marry it?\u201d\n\n\u25aa Quote of the night: \u201cI\u2019m going to hopefully make them feel at ease.\u201d \u2014 Shep about the weird situation awaiting him on Kiawah\n\n\u25aa Moment that \u201cfeeling at ease\u201d became difficult: \u201cI come bearing gifts.\u201d \u2014 Shep yawn-holding a basket full of towels and flip-flops for the women\n\n\u25aa Moment that \u201cfeeling at ease\u201d became not possible ever: \u201cI don\u2019t know the sizes.\u201d \u2014 Shep yawn-referring to the group present in a way that indicated he neither bought these things himself nor cared enough to get specific with it\n\n\u25aa Peyton stress-ate in every shot she was in. Every shot. And, straight-up, her drunk-eating that cheeseburger needs to be its own show. I have a feeling she\u2019s going to be the first girl out because of her \u201csassyness\u201d (OK, Grandsheppy) but I don\u2019t want her to go. Without her it\u2019s just four girls who might be a paperdoll chain of the same person.\n\n\u25aa Kylie sucks for two reasons: One, I don\u2019t like people who insult other people\u2019s grapefruit. And, two, she plays dirty and it\u2019s gross. She was like \u201cHere\u2019s my recipe for Shepard\u2019s Pie: Take two aging eggs. Crack. Crack. Scramble. Bye, Priscila.\u201d\n\n\u25aa Cameran Part Two: She said Shep\u2019s number is terrifying. Now I need to know it. Also, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still keeping track. That\u2019s kind of quaint. It\u2019s got to be like 200, right? 700? 4? I can\u2019t even guess ... 368?\n\n\u25aa Re: Arden\u2019s Say Yes to Everything Plan ... she probably should have said no to a couple of things, though, right? Like \u201cCan I pull off referring to myself in the third person?\u201d and \u201cShould I remain asleep on this date with Shep?\u201d and \u201cDo I leave the stick in?\u201d\n\n\u25aa If you want to know what \u201cShut up, Kylie\u201d sounds like in Silence, rewind to the part where Priscila asks who\u2019s kissed Shep so far.\n\n\u25aa Shep: I never lie. Bella: Cool. I don\u2019t want to kiss on camera. Shep: Not a problem. Let\u2019s go outside. Bella: No cameras? Shep: Your virtue is safe. Kisses her on camera ...\n\n\u25aa Every time Shep puts Sarah the Producer in a headlock, \u201cHungry Eyes\u201d starts autoplaying on my phone ... does anyone know how to fix this?\n\n\u25aa If you want to know what \u201cShut up, Bella\u201d sounds like in Silence, rewind to the part where she comes home from her dinner date and spills tea on her makeout session.\n\n\u25aa Peyton acting like a skittish freak at the beach > Arden\u2019s reaction to getting nicked by Craig\u2019s broken beer bottle shards? Or Arden\u2019s reaction to getting nicked by Craig\u2019s broken beer bottle shards > Peyton acting like a skittish freak at the beach? I can\u2019t decide. But I will say this ... they both produced the same amount of secondhand embarrassment for me.\n\n\u25aa Austen\u2019s facial expression after Peyton gave him the rundown on how girls like to believe they\u2019re the only ones getting sent a meme was A. The same one he got when he found out he\u2019s not actually Clean Shep despite what his mirror has told him; B. The way he\u2019d look if the question \u201cHave you ever written a fan letter to Carrot Top?\u201d came up during a game of Never Have I Ever; or C. Very effing appropriate.\n\n\u25aa When Shep \u201cpulled an Arden\u201d by saying \u201cYes!\u201d to a Speedo appearance, part of me wondered whether he was doing it in the hopes that at least one of the women would tap out and thereby relieve him of the painful task of rejecting her later. Not that he looks terrible in a Speedo. He just looks like his body is saying \u201cYou have all the information now.\u201d\n\n\u25aa Favorite moment of the evening: Peyton mocking Kylie.\n\n\u25aa Second favorite moment: Priscila mocking Peyton.\n\n\u25aa Least favorite moment: Sarah the Producer\u2019s ominous news that an unchosen woman has invited herself to the beach house mansion.
