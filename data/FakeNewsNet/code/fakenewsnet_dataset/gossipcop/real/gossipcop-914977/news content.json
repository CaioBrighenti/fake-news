The anchor got stuck, so the crew had to saw the anchor off before they could sail anywhere,\u201d said our loose-lipped landlubber. \u201cWhen they got out to sea, the engine caught fire. It was a huge blaze and the crew was fighting to put it out. They didn\u2019t have a fire extinguisher nor did they speak English,\u201d we\u2019re told.\n\nI don\u2019t know, is it possible that the crew set the place on fire themselves so they didn\u2019t have to hear anymore complaints about the anchor? The source reports that the sea was also so rough that anything not nailed to the floor\u2014which included but was not limited to seats\u2014started \u201cflying about,\u201d and that there weren\u2019t enough life jackets for everyone on board.\n\nI am currently writing this blog post from a different part of Colombia, but this story does explain a high-pitched wail I could have sworn I heard wafting through my window. I thought a distant cat had been hit by a car, but it was probably this:\n\nThe cast, we\u2019re told, mustered a characteristic \u201cReal Housewife\u201d response. \u201cThey all thought they were going to die and they were hysterical,\u201d we\u2019re told. \u201cBethenny [Frankel], Ramona [Singer] and Dorinda [Medley] were soaked and screaming hysterically, Carole [Radziwill] and Tinsley [Mortimer] were literally throwing up from seasickness. They were far out to sea and they thought they were going down like the Titanic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, a Bravo rep said that \u201c \u2018The Real Housewives of New York City\u2019 cast was recently on a boat in South America and encountered turbulent water. Thankfully, everyone is fine and was able to continue their vacation as planned. The safety of our cast and crew is paramount and, to that end, we are doing a full investigation.\u201d\n\nThey may have bravely continued their vacation, but evidently the Housewives were so traumatized by their little nightmare that Bravo has offered them counseling.", "images": ["https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=5zq9nmk&ct=0:ngtk7da&fmt=3", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--13mfvap3--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/jikwcrdnm1nplv3cu6fn.jpg", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--LmzBksNl--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/jikwcrdnm1nplv3cu6fn.jpg", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--twpSXs_U--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/hfnnrjxf1xjzukb3irfx.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6770184&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/activity;dc_iu=/4246/DFP_Audience_Pixel;dc_seg=22540930;blog=jezebel;ord=1"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--13mfvap3--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/jikwcrdnm1nplv3cu6fn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Evans", "About The Author", "Night Blogger At Jezebel"], "canonical_link": "https://jezebel.com/rhony-pleasure-cruise-ends-with-fire-vomit-1823147421", "title": "RHONY Pleasure Cruise Reportedly Ends With Fire, Vomit", "meta_data": {"dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-edd40da2ae92de7cb0979025edd33027.css", "google-site-verification": "qtdmeMUkQ1jhQhHGFHv6CO2FpKGPcUfc9TYEabpRR0A", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Ys2MwAPg--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--qLil8nTi--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "keywords": "real housewives of new york city, colombia, fire vomit, rhony, Jezebel", "news_keywords": "real housewives of new york city, colombia, fire vomit, rhony, Jezebel", "twitter": {"url": "https://jezebel.com/rhony-pleasure-cruise-ends-with-fire-vomit-1823147421", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--13mfvap3--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/jikwcrdnm1nplv3cu6fn.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@jezebel", "title": "RHONY\u00a0Pleasure Cruise\u00a0Reportedly\u00a0Ends With Fire, Vomit", "description": "The ladies of the Real Housewives of New York City were trapped on the pleasure cruise from hell, Page Six reports, with a day intended for sunbathing on the pristine shores of the Colombian coast ending with \u201cthe cast awash in vomit and fearing for their lives as their boat caught fire and started sinking.\u201d Isn\u2019t that how these things always end?"}, "og": {"title": "RHONY\u00a0Pleasure Cruise\u00a0Reportedly\u00a0Ends With Fire, Vomit", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--13mfvap3--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/jikwcrdnm1nplv3cu6fn.jpg", "url": "https://jezebel.com/rhony-pleasure-cruise-ends-with-fire-vomit-1823147421", "description": "The ladies of the Real Housewives of New York City were trapped on the pleasure cruise from hell, Page Six reports, with a day intended for sunbathing on the pristine shores of the Colombian coast ending with \u201cthe cast awash in vomit and fearing for their lives as their boat caught fire and started sinking.\u201d Isn\u2019t that how these things always end?", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Jezebel"}, "author": "Lauren Evans", "description": "The ladies of the Real Housewives of New York City were trapped on the pleasure cruise from hell, Page Six reports, with a day intended for sunbathing on the pristine shores of the Colombian coast ending with \u201cthe cast awash in vomit and fearing for their lives as their boat caught fire and started sinking.\u201d Isn\u2019t that how these things always end?", "fb": {"app_id": 40338819712}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://jezebel.com", "summary": ""}
