Before becoming a world-famous action star, Jason Statham originally pursued a career in diving and was a member of Britain's National Diving Squad for twelve years. An agent spotted him in 1998 and his career in front of the camera took off almost instantly. His dozens of films have grossed more than $1 billion dollars at the worldwide box office. He also did a bit of modeling in his early career for the clothing line French Connection, and was subsequently spotted by Guy Ritchie, who cast him in the films \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\" in 1998 and \"Snatch\" in 2000.\n\n\"Snatch\" proved to be an international hit and launched his career in Hollywood. He appeared in various films throughout the early 2000s, including \"The One\" and \"Ghosts of Mars\", but it was the action film, \"The Transporter\" that made him a household name. He has subsequently appeared in two sequels. Since then, he has starred in a number of action films, including \"The Italian Job\", \"Crank\", \"The Bank Job\", \"Crank: High Voltage\", \"Death Race\", and \"The Expendables\".\n\nStatham has also starred in the films The Mechanic, Blitz, Killer Elite, Safe, The Expendables 2, Parker, Redemption, Homefront, The Expendables 3, Wild Card, Spy, Fast & Furious 7, Mechanic: Resurrection, and Fast & Furious 8. In 2006 Statham won a Women Film Critics Circle Award for Most Offensive Male Character for Crank. Statham competed for England as a diver at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Jason has been dating model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley since 2010. The couple became engaged in 2016 and welcomed their first son in 2017.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-504136806-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/epstein.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/GettyImages-488355885-e1557100267439.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-167802829.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Robert-Downey-Jr.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brandon-Thomas-Lee.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jason-Statham2.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Jet-Li.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-300x300/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Jason-Statham.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Ariana-Grande-2.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/rock.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1093667182.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-502228488.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Jason-Statham.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Leonardo-DiCaprio.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tc.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1160570133.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Pamela-Anderson.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Tom-Hanks1-e1558999027688.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Jon-Favreau.jpg"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Jason-Statham.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/jason-statham-net-worth/", "title": "Jason Statham Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Jason Statham net worth and salary: Jason Statham is a British actor who has a net worth of $80 million.
