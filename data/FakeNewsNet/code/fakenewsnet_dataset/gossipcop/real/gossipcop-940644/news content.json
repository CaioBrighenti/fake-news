Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Nick Offerman also star, with Drew Goddard directing from his own script. Goddard also produced \u201cBad Times.\u201d\n\nBridges is warned by the clerk, \u201cThis is not a place for a priest, father,\u201d and admits later in the trailer, \u201cCan I confess something to you? I\u2019m not really a priest.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not quite clear from the trailer why the characters have come to the El Royale and the studio\u2019s description of the plot is somewhat obscure: \u201cSeven strangers, each with a secret to bury, meet at Lake Tahoe\u2019s El Royale, a run-down hotel with a dark past. Over the course of one fateful night, everyone will have a last shot at redemption \u2026 before everything goes to hell.\u201d\n\nBridges received his seventh Oscar nomination last year for \u201cHell or High Water.\u201d Goddard received an Academy Award nom in 2016 for best adapted screenplay for \u201cThe Martian\u201d and directed Hemsworth in 2012\u2019s \u201cThe Cabin in the Woods\u201d from a script he co-wrote with Joss Whedon.\n\n\u201cBad Times at the El Royale\u201d opens Oct. 12.", "images":
