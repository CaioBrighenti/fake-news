Nina added that she is a model with an athletic build and \u201chealthy curves\u201d so the idea that she couldn\u2019t fit their profile was outrageous.\n\nAgdal said she embraces her body and is proud to have it despite what some people in the industry may want from her.\n\nThe former girlfriend of Leonardo DiCaprio said when she first started in the industry as a 16-year-old girl; she had unhealthy and insufficient eating habits. However, she has grown from those experiences and is now making choices that are closer to who she is as a person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you may know, Nina\u2019s message for the world comes at a time when women everywhere are attempting to take pride in their bodies in spite of the \u201cunnatural\u201d body images perpetrated by the advertising industry. According to scholars such as Naomi Wolf, the normal healthy body weight is much higher than what fashion models would have you believe.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Donald-Trump-Jr-and-Aubrey-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chiris-Pratt-Nashville-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kenya-Moore-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nina-Agdal-IMG-Models.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/James-Franco-Is-Frustrated-By-Sexual-Assault-Claims-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Leonardo-Dicaprio-Nina-Agdal-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/qasa-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Camila-Cabello-Shawn-Mendes-300x157.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Leonardo-DiCaprio-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nina-Agdal-IMG-Models.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "Lynn Gintonio", "Ann Mose", "Gloria Meredith", "Annie Smith"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/nina-agdal-shares-empowering-message-after-a-magazine-body-shamed-her-104529/", "title": "Nina Agdal Shares Empowering Message After A Magazine Body-Shamed Her", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "nina agdal,", "keywords": "celebrity news, nina agdal,", "description": "Nina Agdal wrote a message on her social media account today detailing her body-shaming experiences after a magazine allegedly refused to run a cover", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Nina Agdal Shares Empowering Message After A Magazine Body-Shamed Her", "description": "Nina Agdal wrote a message on her social media account today detailing her body-shaming experiences after a magazine allegedly refused to run a cover", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/nina-agdal-shares-empowering-message-after-a-magazine-body-shamed-her-104529/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Nina-Agdal-IMG-Models.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-12", "modified_time": "2018-01-12", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/bridgethill/", "section": "Fashion", "tag": "nina agdal"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515733200.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
