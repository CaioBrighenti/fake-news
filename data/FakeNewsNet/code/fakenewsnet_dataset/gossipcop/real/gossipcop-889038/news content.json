From the moment she walked on set with her talent, intellect, and spirit, she became part of the family!\u201d\n\nThe Tony-award winning actress is best known for starring as Dr. Callie Torres on Grey\u2019s Anatomy for more than a decade, exiting in 2016 at the end of season 12 amid contract negotiations for the main cast members. Hope for the actress to return to the long-running medical drama seemed to diminish after Ramirez called out ABC over an offensive joke about bisexual people during an episode of The Real O\u2019Neals; in addition to playing a bisexual character on Grey\u2019s, Ramirez also identifies as bisexual.\n\nRamirez also lends her voice to the animated series Sofia the First.\n\nMadam Secretary airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on CBS.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/1568-angel_1200x6282.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/netflix-tvs.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/angel2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sara-ramirez.jpg?crop=0px%2C229px%2C1763px%2C925px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad140d40dd6562601aa876e83bafb3d2?s=300&d=blank&r=g"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sara-ramirez.jpg?crop=0px%2C229px%2C1763px%2C925px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Abrams"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/24/sara-ramirez-madam-secretary-greys-anatomy/", "title": "Grey's Anatomy star Sara Ramirez books gig on Madam Secretary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Sara Ramirez, CBS, Madam Secretary, Grey's Anatomy, is sara ramirez returning to greys anatomy", "news_keywords": "Sara Ramirez, CBS, Madam Secretary, Grey's Anatomy, is sara ramirez returning to greys anatomy", "description": "The beloved actress will be appearing on Madam Secretary", "og": {"title": "Sara Ramirez books post-'Grey's Anatomy' gig on 'Madam Secretary'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/24/sara-ramirez-madam-secretary-greys-anatomy/", "description": "Sara Ramirez is returning to television, but she won't be suiting up in scrubs.
