That\u2019s our Mother\u2019s Day episode,\u201d Pinkett Smith said. \u201cI thought it was important to have that conversation because she was my entry point to motherhood. I was co-mothering with her. At that particular time, before [having a blended family] was popular, before it was even an idea, we were trying to create something that we had never experienced.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe came from broken homes. We didn\u2019t have a blueprint. We just had an idea. This is what we think we want. This is what we want to try to do for Trey.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

It\u2019s constantly unfolding.
