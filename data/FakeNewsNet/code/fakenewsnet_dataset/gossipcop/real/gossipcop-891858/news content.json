O\u2019Donnell, now 55, said she underwent \u201cgastric sleeve\u201d surgery.\n\n\u201cSo they take about, they probably leave a quarter of your stomach, the size of a banana,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd they said you put your hand out\u2026 that\u2019s the size of your stomach in general so mine has like a little bit\u2026 I\u2019m 50 pounds less than I was.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Rosie O\u2019Donnell Is \u2018Seriously Worried\u2019 About Surviving Trump Presidency\n\nThe Primetime Emmy Award-winner insisted this was no run-of-the-mill procedure. \u201cYou only have this surgery when you\u2019re near death\u2026 I should\u2019ve died,\u201d O\u2019Donnell continued. \u201cThe doctor said there\u2019s no reason you survived this heart attack.
