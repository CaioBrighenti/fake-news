(CBSDC) \u2014 When WWE Superstar Jimmy Uso got caught having marital relations with his wife Trinity, who also happens to be a pro wrestler, on the reality show Total Divas, it was, well\u2026 real.\n\nIn one of the most memorable moments of the second season of the hit show on E!, Uso and his WWE Diva bride, known on-camera as Naomi, were sharing a luxury bus with a number of other talents, including the recently wed Daniel Bryan and Brie Bella.\n\nBecause of the close quarters, there was a strict policy against heightened levels of intimacy. But, as has been proven time and again in pro wrestling, rules are made to be broken.\n\n\u201cI honestly, I couldn\u2019t hold out any longer,\u201d Uso said. \u201cThey caught us flat out.\u201d\n\nUso, one half of the WWE tag team champions with his twin brother Jey, said you could tell he wasn\u2019t acting just by the expression on his face.\n\n\u201cSomebody sent me a picture of the way I was looking, it was hilarious,\u201d he said. \u201cYa know, I\u2019m on the road 24-7, so I can\u2019t even see my wife half the time so I had to go there\u2026 I told my mom not to watch!\u201d\n\nFilming for the third season of Total Divas began two weeks ago, according to Uso.\n\nOn the wrestling side, he\u2019s thrilled with the way his career is going at the moment and credits both his father, Rikishi, and late uncle, Umaga, for playing a role in their success. He noted that he feels Umaga\u2019s presence watching over them during their matches.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to take care of us when we dive over the ropes or do these crazy spots,\u201d Uso said.\n\nHe said it was only when The Usos began just \u201cletting go\u201d and being themselves in the ring that fans began following them.\n\n\u201cIt got really fun for us over the last two years,\u201d Uso said.\n\nHe\u2019s partnered with his brother since debuting with WWE in 2010, but would be interested in pursuing a singles career if given the right opportunity.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, I would love to try and see where I stand in the singles competition as long as my brother does well, too,\u201d he said. \u201cOne goal that I have is to headline WrestleMania against my twin brother. It\u2019d be awesome in a tables, ladders and chairs match. Because when we grew up we saw Jeff Hardy, the Dudley Boyz, Edge and Christian have a (TLC) match. I thought it was the best match\u2026 That\u2019s what really hooked us.\u201d\n\nUso said he got so excited at one point watching the three-way match at WrestleMania 17 that he accidentally hit his brother in the nose.\n\nThe Usos will defend their tag team titles against the Wyatt Family on Sunday at Money In The Bank on pay-per-view and the WWE Network.\n\nChuck Carroll is a pro wrestling aficionado who has been around sports-entertainment for nearly two decades.
