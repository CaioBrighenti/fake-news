She stayed at Walt Disney World hotel and helped entertain other evacuees.\n\n\"She was on spring break, and every hour, someone called me, panicked, [to find out] if she was OK. This brat was on spring break!\u201d he joked. \u201cSo in that time, I bought my 4-year-old an electric motorcycle and taught her to ride it.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Kristen Bell Shares Moving Flashback Photo of Her and Dax Shepard 'Patiently Waiting Out' First Pregnancy\n\nHe then showed footage to the audience of his little girl\u2019s first ride on the motorcycle. Watch the moment in the video below.\n\n\"Look at her!\" said Shepard, who is a proclaimed motorcycle enthusiast. \"Come on! That makes me happier than anything.\"\n\n\"She rode for three hours, never crashed...she digs it,\u201d he continued. \u201cAgain, she likes how much I dig it, because I'm very vocal about my approval when she's riding that thing.\"\n\nFor more on the happy family, watch the video below.\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2016-12/1280_hilary_duff_luca_dec16_instagram.jpg?itok=09CfbtWv", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/rozman_20171018_15033_0639r.jpg?itok=kf_mSikY", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-10/rozman_20171018_15033_0639r.jpg?itok=wQ8WxriI&h=c6980913"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/rozman_20171018_15033_0639r.jpg?itok=kf_mSikY", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elisa Osegueda"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/dax-shepard-shares-cute-video-his-daughter-riding-mini-motorcycle-see-sweet-moment-89534", "title": "Dax Shepard Shares Cute Video of His Daughter Riding a Mini Motorcycle -- See the Sweet Moment!", "meta_data": {"title": "Dax Shepard Shares Cute Video of His Daughter Riding a Mini Motorcycle -- See the Sweet Moment!  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/dax-shepard-shares-cute-video-his-daughter-riding-mini-motorcycle-see-sweet-moment-89534", "title": "Dax Shepard Shares Cute Video of His Daughter Riding a Mini Motorcycle -- See the Sweet Moment!", "description": "The 42-year-old actor stopped by the 'Ellen DeGeneres Show' to promote his wife, Kristen Bell\u2019s, new movie, \u2018Bad Moms 2.\u2019", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/rozman_20171018_15033_0639r.jpg?itok=kf_mSikY", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 42-year-old actor stopped by the 'Ellen DeGeneres Show' to promote his wife, Kristen Bell\u2019s, new movie, \u2018Bad Moms 2.\u2019", "title": "Dax Shepard Shares Cute Video of His Daughter Riding a Mini Motorcycle -- See the Sweet Moment!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Elisa Osegueda\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/dax-shepard-shares-cute-video-his-daughter-riding-mini-motorcycle-see-sweet-moment-89534", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/rozman_20171018_15033_0639r.jpg?itok=kf_mSikY"}, "description": "The 42-year-old actor stopped by the 'Ellen DeGeneres Show' to promote his wife, Kristen Bell\u2019s, new movie, \u2018Bad Moms 2.\u2019", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Dax Shepard, Kristen Bell", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Dax Shepard, Kristen Bell"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/QXL7R5eAc24?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
