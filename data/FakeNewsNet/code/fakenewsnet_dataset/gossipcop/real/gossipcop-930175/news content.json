(\u201cRahhhhhnnnn! Staaaaahhhhp!\u201d)\n\nThere\u2019s also been plenty of speculation amongst the cast that Giancola\u2019s ex Ronnie Ortiz-Magro isn\u2019t over the relationship. Their tumultuous on-again, off-again romance lasted seven years, three of which were captured on the original run of Jersey Shore from 2009-12. Giancola, 31, has said she opted out of the MTV reboot to focus on her businesses and her relationship \u2014 and avoid \u201cpotentially toxic situations,\u201d presumably referring to Ortiz-Magro, 32.\n\nDuring a heart-to-heart on last week\u2019s episode, Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi, 30, came to the conclusion that Ortiz-Magro was still harboring feelings for his ex.\n\n\u201cYou f\u2014ing love Sam,\u201d she told him. \u201cListen, you need to stop. Babe, get over Sam. It\u2019s been f\u2014ing 10 years. Why are we still talking about this?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I just miss the feeling of like, security,\u201d he replied. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what she gave. And that\u2019s so f\u2014ing hard to find. And I feel like that\u2019s why I am the way I am and will continue to be the way I am. \u2026 Every man wishes that he can be with the love of his life. Like, being with someone for seven years and then you don\u2019t end up with that person? Yeah, it hurts.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I mean, did you not laugh at the Sam doll? Editing just got him every time he spoke about her.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Sammi \"Sweetheart\" Giancola in 2013 Chris Roque/Getty\n\nAnd Giancola aside, Ortiz-Magro has his own relationship drama to deal with. This week, he split from Jen Harley, his girlfriend of over a year \u2014 less than a month after the two welcomed their first child together April 3, daughter Ariana Sky.\n\nThe relationship fell apart after a bitter feud erupted between the two on social media, with Ortiz-Magro alleging in a series of posts that his girlfriend was keeping \u201csex videos\u201d with an ex.\n\n\u201cNote to self, can\u2019t turn a natural born HOE, into a HOUSEWIFE, if you find them in the gutter then leave them in the gutter,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNot all people can be saved when they are so far gone. All you can say you did [your] best and keep it moving.\u201d\n\nHarley, who is also mom to son Mason from a previous relationship, shot back in her own Instagram story, writing, \u201cCan\u2019t turn a coke head into a father!\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Apologizes After Public Feud with Girlfriend \u2014 \u2018I Acted on My Gut\u2019\n\nOn Monday, the tension escalated when Harley went live on Instagram in the middle of an altercation between the two. But according to a source, the incident was \u201cblown out of proportion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had a verbal dispute, it happens in relationships,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe found a video that he didn\u2019t want to see and got upset about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s getting labeled as this bad guy when he really isn\u2019t,\u201d the insider added. \u201cHe\u2019s stressed and doesn\u2019t want people to look at him in a bad light.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro\u2019s Ex Posts First Photo of Daughter After Former Couple Feuds on Social Media\n\nImage zoom Jen Harley and Ronnie Magro Jen Harley/Instagram\n\nThe new father has since apologized for what went down.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize to my family, friends and fans,\u201d he said in a statement Monday evening. \u201cThis is a private matter that should have never been made public. I remain focused on my daughter and she is my number one priority.\u201d\n\nIndeed, according to the source, Ortiz-Magro and Harley \u201care speaking civilly and trying to make sure Ariana has the best life possible.\u201d (The estranged couple will \u201cwork out the visitation stuff once the dust settles.\u201d)\n\nAs for whether there\u2019s hope for a reconciliation? That remains to be seen, but the source said Ortiz-Magro \u201cjust wants to do his best for the baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where his heart is at,\u201d the source said.\n\nJersey Shore Family
