{"url": "https://ew.com/tv/the-office-where-are-they-now/", "text": "Carell had made inroads as a comedy supporting player in properties like The Daily Show and Anchorman, but his role as Michael Scott, a well-meaning but bumbling and ignorant boss, shot him to super-stardom. He earned six Emmy nominations during this tenure as the world\u2019s worst boss (who somehow thinks he\u2019s the best). Following his debut as Michael Scott, Carell went on to star in films like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Get Smart, Date Night opposite Tina Fey, and Crazy, Stupid, Love. In 2010, he endeared himself to younger audiences voicing super-villain turned lovable father Gru in Despicable Me, a role he has reprised in several sequels. Recently, Carell has featured in more dramatic roles, earning praise for his work in Little Miss Sunshine, an Oscar nomination for Foxcatcher and Oscar buzz for this year\u2019s Last Flag Flying. On the second season of The Office, Carell also gained a producing credit. He now runs a production company with his wife Nancy and they produce the Rashida Jones-led Angie Tribeca on TBS.", "images":
