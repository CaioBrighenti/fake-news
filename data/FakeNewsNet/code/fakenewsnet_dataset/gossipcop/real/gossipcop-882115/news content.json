In fact, he\u2019s not on most social media sites. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t a few great parody sites out there.\n\nGyllenhaal referred to himself as a \u201cdrag and drop kind of guy\u201d while appearing on Conan, saying that he knows computers, but not very well. So, he kind of steers clear from anything more advanced than basic computing.\n\nOne of the best accounts out there is @JakeActivities, which happens to showcase funny photos of Gyllenhaal enjoying life.\n\nThe actor only recently heard about the website, and let\u2019s just say he was pretty into it.\n\nOne of our favorites is \u201cJake laughing at his sandwich.\u201d As he pointed out, sandwiches are hilarious.\n\nSurprisingly, @JakeActivities is still fairly new. The account launched this March, and currently has over 9,000 followers. Here are a few of our favorite tweets that Conan O\u2019Brien didn\u2019t cover.\n\njake gyllenhaal holding a ferret (2016) pic.twitter.com/lX5YKFG4Nd \u2014 jake doing things (@JakeActivities) July 12, 2017\n\nWhile it seems out of place, the ferret was part of a sketch that he helped out with on Amy Schumer\u2019s show, Inside Amy Schumer.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal helping Lily Collins hold her dress (2017) pic.twitter.com/c66vJrqdM5 \u2014 jake doing things (@JakeActivities) May 21, 2017\n\nBecause he\u2019s such a gentleman.\n\njake gyllenhaal at the donnie darko hollywood premiere (2004) pic.twitter.com/JuHBk7ptda \u2014 jake doing things (@JakeActivities) April 9, 2017\n\nFeeling a little nostalgic? Just check out the actor promoting Donnie Darko, well over a decade ago.\n\njake gyllenhaal blocking the sun from his eyes while he has on sunglasses pic.twitter.com/GmkP9rpxGW \u2014 jake doing things (@JakeActivities) March 31, 2017\n\nHey, sometimes it\u2019s just that sunny out. Or, sometimes sunglasses just aren\u2019t as good as we thought prior to purchasing them.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t think that the account will inspire Gyllenhaal to start up his own account, at least we know that he somewhat approves. And hey, maybe he checks the account on occasion to double check and see what he\u2019s been up to.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10073851/maisie-williams-pink-e1562769578725.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/18082412/Tessa-Thompson.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10123639/beyonce-lion-king-red-carpet-e1562787450855.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/22022951/jake-gyllenhaal1.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/31070408/cardi-b-plastic-surgery-e1562948360431.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11101500/pink-e1562865327929.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12082251/jade-tolbert1-e1562945630169.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12114552/miley-cyrus-sexism-e1562957164576.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/26071400/Mindy.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/24080352/Billie-Eilish.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072528/avatar-d-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12110111/miley-cyrus-hannah-montana-e1562954478310.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/10115634/kim-kardashian-psalm-west-pic-e1562858597437.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08072854/Baby-Archie-Meghan-Markle-and-Prince-Harry.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11150209/arianagrandepolitical.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08082004/ariana-grande-tour-e1562599214825.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12065649/Reese-Witherspoon-and-Selma-Blair.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10074216/gettyimages-1160065700-e1562771408891.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/13121055/ariana-grande-mac-miller-hometown-e1560453067829.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/26070703/Lizzo-MTV-Awards1.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/03070815/miley-cyrus-e1562861696992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/22022951/jake-gyllenhaal1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/", "title": "Jake Gyllenhaal was shown a Twitter account that makes fun of his entire life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "inside amy schumer,jake gyllenhaal", "news_keywords": "inside amy schumer,jake gyllenhaal", "description": "We think this account is funny, and we're so glad that Jake Gyllenhaal thinks it's humorous too.", "og": {"title": "Jake Gyllenhaal was shown a Twitter account that makes fun of his entire life", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/", "description": "This may be the funniest way to keep up with the actor.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/22022951/jake-gyllenhaal1.jpg", "width": 656, "height": 985}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/", "description": "We think this account is funny, and we're so glad that Jake Gyllenhaal thinks it's humorous too.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/22022951/jake-gyllenhaal1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jake-gyllenhaal-was-shown-a-twitter-account-that-makes-fun-of-his-entire-life/", "title": "Jake Gyllenhaal was shown a Twitter account that makes fun of his entire life", "description": "This may be the funniest way to keep up with the actor.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/22022951/jake-gyllenhaal1.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/oanBk7rVw44?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
