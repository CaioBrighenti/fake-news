But one area in Hef's wheelhouse that's often overlooked is the mark he left on reality television, specifically, the E! series \"The Girls Next Door.\"\n\nThe TV series originally aired from 2005 until 2010, and was co-created by the Playboy founder. The first five seasons starred Hef's three main girlfriends, Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson, and Bridget Marquardt, while the sixth and final season focused on Hef's new girlfriends, twins Kristina and Karissa Shannon, and a then-23-year-old Crystal Harris, who would eventually become his third wife.\n\nWireImage Holly Madison, Hugh Hefner, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson.

Via Twitter, Marquardt posted a picture of her and Hef in better times, writing, \"So sad but forever grateful for all the wonderful memories and amazing experiences #RIPHef #Playboy \ud83d\udc94.\"\n\nSo sad but forever grateful for all the wonderful memories and amazing experiences #RIPHef#Playboy \ud83d\udc94 pic.twitter.com/RkHje7h0Un \u2014 Bridget Marquardt (@Bridget) September 28, 2017\n\nIn a statement, Wilkinson said: \"Hef changed my life. He made me the person I am today. I couldn't be more thankful for our friendship and our time together. I will miss him so much but he will be in my heart forever.\"\n\nCharley Gallay/Getty Images for Playboy Hugh Hefner and Crystal Hefner attend Playboy Mansion's Annual Halloween Bash on October 25, 2014 in Los Angeles.

(Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage)\n\nDespite these allegations, many of Hef's ex-girlfriends, friends, and Playmates shared their condolences on social media. Pamela Anderson, who made the cover of Playboy a whopping 14 times, shared her grief on Instagram, posting a video of her crying and whispering, \"Goodbye, Hef,\" along with a poem about her love and respect for her friend.\n\n\"Outside of my family, you were the most important person in my life. You gave me my life... People tell me all the time that I was your favourite,\" Anderson wrote. \"Everything anyone loves about me is because you understood me. Accepted me and encouraged me to be myself,\" she added. Kim Kardashian, who appeared on the cover of Playboy in 2007, also spoke out on Hefner's death, writing on Twitter:\n\nRIP to the legendary Hugh Hefner! I'm so honored to have been a part of the Playboy team! You will be greatly missed! Love you Hef!

Carmen Electra:\n\nAnd Jenny McCarthy:", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd508352000005c00965f6e.png?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale",
