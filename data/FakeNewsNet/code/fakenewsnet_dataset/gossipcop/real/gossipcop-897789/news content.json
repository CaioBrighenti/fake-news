And I had one of the best nights of my life,\u201d Bell, 37, captioned a photo with her husband whizzing down the rink on her Instagram stories.\n\nThey also shared videos highlighting their dance moves while on wheels, including those of friends who joined such as Bell\u2019s former Veronica Mars co-star, Ryan Hansen.\n\nAt one point, the men even linked up with their hands on each others\u2019 hips and skated around as a four-person chain.\n\nBell proudly announced, \u201cIncredible night at @officialmoonlightrollerway\u2013 not a single broken bone!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell Kristen Bell/Instagram\n\nImage zoom Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell Kristen Bell/Instagram\n\nImage zoom Kristen Bell/Instagram\n\nImage zoom Ryan Hansen Kristen Bell/Instagram\n\nThe couple married in 2013 after six years of dating. They share daughters Lincoln, 4, and Delta, 2 \u2014 and have worked out the perfect parenting tactic: the \u201ctag team.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe switch kids all the time,\u201d the Frozen actress told reporters of her children at Alliance of Moms\u2019 Raising Baby event last month. \u201cBecause if I\u2019m talking to the 2\u00bd-year-old, and I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll just be like, \u2018We\u2019ve got to switch. I don\u2019t want to talk to this kid anymore.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBell explained that the kid-swapping is done with good intentions: to give them the attention they deserve.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be reactive to you kids. You want to be thoughtful, and you want to be setting a good example,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes that example is crying in front of them and saying, \u2018I\u2019m overwhelmed,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m sad because of XYZ,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m just sad because I\u2019m feeling sad. I\u2019m going to let my sad out. And then I\u2019m going to find a way to cheer myself up.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe actress continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not about perfection, but it is about being thoughtful and not reactive. So in order to not be reactive, we switch kids a lot.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kristen Bell Says Therapy Is the Secret Behind Her Happy Marriage to Dax Shepard\n\nBell and Shepard, 42, have been open about their relationship\u2019s \u201cvolatile\u201d start and the importance of therapy in their marriage. They also recognize the need to take brief breaks from their kids, even if it\u2019s hard to fit into their busy schedules.\n\n\u201cYou just do. There\u2019s no easy way,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t, and then you have a stressful couple months, and then you find time to do. There\u2019s no trick to doing it, other than having really good communication with your partner, and being able to say, \u2018I\u2019m reaching capacity. So I need to go take a hike today, or I need to go have lunch with a girlfriend.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cSomething that makes me feel like a woman again.\u201d", "images":
