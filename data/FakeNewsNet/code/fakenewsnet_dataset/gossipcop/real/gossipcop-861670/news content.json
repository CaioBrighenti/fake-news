Heinously and exploitively ambitious. How do I describe the judge? Overtly arrogant and collaborating with the district attorney. How do I describe the counsels for the accusers? Totally unethical. How do I describe many, but not all, general media? Blatantly vicious entities that continually disseminated intentional omissions of truths for the primary purpose of greedily selling sensationalism at the expense of a human life.\n\n\"Historically people have challenged injustices. I am grateful to any of the jurors who tenaciously fought to review the evidence; which is the rightful way to make a sound decision. Ultimately, that is a manifestation of justice, based on facts, not lies. As a very special friend once stated, 'truth can be subdued, but not destroyed.'\n\n\"Moreover, I express humongous gratitude to counselors Brian McMonagle and Angela Agrusa for their hard work. Mr. McMonagle for his passionate and powerful articulations of truth; Ms. Agrusa for her thorough research to bolster counsel McMonagle; to Mr. Andrew Wyatt for his unequivocal skills in public relations; to our team, who worked diligently and intelligently; to our staffs for their continuous commitment to our family and me. And to our children, grandchildren and other family who loves us. And to our dear friends and supporters who never gave up on us despite it all.\n\nRead More", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170612085532-03-bill-and-camille-cosby-0612-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170612085533-02-bill-and-camille-cosby-0612-exlarge-169.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170612085532-03-bill-and-camille-cosby-0612-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelly Mccleary"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/17/us/cosby-verdict-camille-cosby-statement/index.html", "title": "Camille Cosby bashes prosecutors following husband's mistrial", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "us", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2017-06-17T17:38:18Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/17/us/cosby-verdict-camille-cosby-statement/index.html", "title": "Camille Cosby bashes prosecutors following husband's mistrial", "description": "Following the declaration of a mistrial in Bill Cosby's indecent assault trial, his wife, Camille Cosby, issued a fiery statement on Saturday slamming the judge, prosecutors and the media.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170612085532-03-bill-and-camille-cosby-0612-super-tease.jpg", "width": 1100, "height": 619}}, "pubdate": "2017-06-17T17:38:18Z", "lastmod": "2017-06-17T17:45:06Z", "author": "Kelly McCleary, CNN", "twitter": {"title": "Camille Cosby bashes prosecutors following husband's mistrial", "description": "Following the declaration of a mistrial in Bill Cosby's indecent assault trial, his wife, Camille Cosby, issued a fiery statement on Saturday slamming the judge, prosecutors and the media.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170612085532-03-bill-and-camille-cosby-0612-super-tease.jpg"}, "description": "Following the declaration of a mistrial in Bill Cosby's indecent assault trial, his wife, Camille Cosby, issued a fiery statement on Saturday slamming the judge, prosecutors and the media.", "keywords": "us, Camille Cosby bashes prosecutors following husband's mistrial - CNN", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170612085532-03-bill-and-camille-cosby-0612-super-tease.jpg", "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/17/us/cosby-verdict-camille-cosby-statement/index.html"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "template-top": "us,news,art-vid"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497672000.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
