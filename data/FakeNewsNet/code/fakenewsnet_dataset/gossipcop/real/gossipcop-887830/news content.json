While delicious, those lattes aren't quite as eye-catching as the Unicorn Frappe, the neon concoction of the spring.\n\nNever fear, Starbs isn't letting a season go by without giving you something to 'gram. Halloween's creepiest drink, the Vampire Frappuccino, is officially back in at least four countries. Sadly, the bloody-looking treat hasn't been spotted in the U.S. yet, but the U.K., Singapore, Norway and Sweden all have it in stores, E! Online reports.\n\nIn case you need a refresher, the drink starts with mocha sauce, then layers a mocha frappe with strawberry puree to create a blood effect. Most also have whipped cream and more \"blood\" drizzled on top.\n\nSingapore's stores are offering two slightly different versions this year: Mr. and Mrs. Vampire Frappuccino. The Mr. version has chocolatey cereal layered on top, while the Mrs. has a pump of vanilla syrup added.\n\nThere's still plenty of time for the U.S. to catch up, though. Last year, American Starbucks' locations brought back the Frappula a few days before Halloween, but only for a few days. And since the ingredients are available year round, you can technically order it any time you want. Just ask nicely, or the barista's fangs might come out.", "images": ["https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c-1334-667.jpg", "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0-750-563.jpg", "https://static.insider.com/image/57e43fa5a1e30593008b4c91-750.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c-1334-667.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Flager"], "canonical_link": "http://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a56187/vampire-frappucino-starbucks/", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.insider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#111111", "date": "2017-10-19", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-19", "news_keywords": "Contributor, Food, Delish, Starbucks, Frappuccino, Halloween, Dessert, Food Contributor", "sailthru.tags": "Contributor, Food, Delish, Starbucks, Frappuccino, Halloween, Dessert, Food Contributor", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "sailthru.description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "sailthru.verticals": "food", "sailthru.title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c-1334-667.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0-960-720.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Food", "og": {"title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thisisinsider.com/starbucks-vampire-frappuccinos-halloween-2017-10", "image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c-1334-667.jpg", "site_name": "INSIDER"}, "author": "Delish", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.insider.com/starbucks-vampire-frappuccinos-halloween-2017-10", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c-1334-667.jpg", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "INSIDER": "Snapchat", "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508385600.0, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
