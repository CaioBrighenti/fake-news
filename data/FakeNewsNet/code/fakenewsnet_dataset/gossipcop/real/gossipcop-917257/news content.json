Little did they know, they were actually set up for a surprise from T'Challa himself, Chadwick Boseman.\n\nThe fans' messages ranged from funny to sentimental, with many mentioning the significance of seeing a black superhero onscreen. \"It's just a great American superhero movie with people who look like me,\" one man said of the film.\n\n\"Basically everything that represents me was honored in this movie,\" another said.\n\nYouTube\n\nThey also thanked Boseman for his performance in the movie.\n\n\"My son's childhood has been defined by Barack Obama and now Black Panther,\" said one mother, who brought her son on set. The young man's face was priceless when the actor emerged from the curtains.\n\nYouTube\n\n\"I can't express how much it means to me and the community and my family. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all that you've done, for really being a hero that we really need in a time like this,\" said one fan.\n\nHe was so shocked when Boseman appeared, he started doing the Wakanda Forever salute.\n\nYouTube\n\nOne woman also paid tribute to the black women featured in Black Panther, like Boseman's costars Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Angela Bassett, and Letitia Wright.\n\n\"They weren't strong because they were angry, they weren't strong because they were hurt, they were strong because they were strong. And that meant the world to me,\" she said.\n\nBoseman wasn't expecting Black Panther to make this big of an impact. He \"knew it would be a revolutionary idea,\" but he was unsure how the film would be received. \"I didn't necessarily know that people would buy out [the seats in] theaters,\" he told ABC last month.\n\nBut they did, and the film grossed over $200 million when it released on President's Day weekend, earning the second-biggest four-day debut ever.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-chadwick-surprise-index-1519932977.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-chadwick-surprise-index-1519932977.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Gonzales", "Erica Gonzales Is The News", "Entertainment Editor For"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a19042479/chadwick-boseman-surprises-black-panther-fans/", "title": "Chadwick Boseman Surprised Black Panther Fans and We're So Emotional Right Now", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Chadwick Boseman Surprised 'Black Panther' Fans and We're So Emotional Right Now", "description": "\"Basically everything that represents me was honored in this movie.\"", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a19042479/chadwick-boseman-surprises-black-panther-fans/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-chadwick-surprise-index-1519932977.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-03-01 10:30:40", "published_time": "2018-03-01 10:30:00", "section": "Film, TV & Theatre"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-chadwick-surprise-index-1519932977.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman Surprises Fans in an Emotional Video", "description": "The onscreen superhero meets emotional fans of the revolutionary film.", "keywords": "black panther, chadwick boseman, jimmy fallon, tonight show", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-chadwick-surprise-index-1519932977.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture,film-tv,chadwick boseman,black panther,Jimmy Fallon,tonight show", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-01T22:30:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-chadwick-surprise-index-1519932977.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-chadwick-surprise-index-1519932977.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Chadwick Boseman Surprised 'Black Panther' Fans and We're So Emotional Right Now", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519918200.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
