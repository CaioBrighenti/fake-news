And then you go run,\u201d he said. Kitsch added sarcastically: \u201cWhich is awesome!\u201d\n\nImage zoom David Koresh (1981) AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nNow, Kitsch\u2019s diet days are in the past and the star said he\u2019s working to gain the weight back.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t yet so I\u2019m literally eating anything and everything in sight, which is great,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Friday Night Lights fan-favorite looks eerily similar to the cult leader in the new miniseries.\n\nImage zoom Taylor Kitsch (left) and Ellen DeGeneres Michael Rozman/Warner Bros\n\nThe limited series, set to air in January 2018 in six parts on the Paramount Network, will follow the 51-day standoff between the fanatical leader, his followers the Branch Davidians and the FBI and ATF \u2014 which ended in tragedy and the death of 75 Branch Davidians, including Koresh and 25 children, on April 19, 1993.\n\nAaron Carter Returns to Social Media to Show off Impressive Weight Gain After Rehab\n\nKitsch previously opened up to PEOPLE about the weight loss, and other preparations he made for the role.\n\n\u201cIt was four-plus months of prep for me,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom losing just around 30 lbs., to listening to hundreds of hours of phone calls of the tapes with [FBI negotiator] Gary Noesner and the FBI and the ATF to Child Protective Services, to reading David Thibodeau\u2019s book a few times.\u201d", "images":
