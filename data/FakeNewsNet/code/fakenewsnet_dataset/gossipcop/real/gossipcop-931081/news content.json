That\u2019s why The Good Place star has partnered with The Child Mind Institute to help bring awareness to their #MyYoungerSelfCampain in order to share an important message.\n\n\u201cMy name is Kristen. I have suffered from anxiety and/or depression since I was 18,\u201d the star said in a newly released video for the campaign which focuses on mental health and learning disorders. \u201cWhat I would say to my younger self is, \u2018don\u2019t be fooled by this game of perfection [that] humans play.'\u201d\n\nShe went on to remind viewers that projections of perfection aren\u2019t always what they seem.\n\n\u201cInstagram and magazines and TV shows, they strive for a certain aesthetic and everything looks so beautiful and people seem like they don\u2019t have any problems,\u201d said Bell. \u201cEveryone\u2019s human. Everyone has problems. Everyone feels yucky on the inside sometimes.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cYou deserve to feel just as beautiful on the days you wear no makeup and the days you don\u2019t shower and the days you feel like you\u2019re depressed. You have an obligation to take care of yourself from the inside out, because that\u2019s how you can truly feel beautiful.\u201d\n\nFinally, the actress reminded viewers that they are worthy of care and happiness, regardless of their mental health status. \u201cYou are not alone,\u201d she said. \u201cNever feel embarrassed or ashamed about who you are.\u201d\n\nKristen Bell isn\u2019t the only one with something important to say during this awesome campaign. Every day during the month of May, which marks National Mental Health Awareness Month, The Child Mind Institute will share a video featuring celebs such as Gabrielle Union, James Van Der Beek, Brittany Snow, and Sarah Silverman who will each share messages to their younger selves regarding mental health and learning disorders.\n\nWhat would you tell your younger self if you had the chance?
