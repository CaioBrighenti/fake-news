Kristen Bell began her career on Broadway in \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\". She has gone on to play leading or supporting roles in many film and TV projects including \"When in Rome\", \"Veronica Mars\", and the movie musical, \"Burlesque\". Born Kristen Anne Bell on July 18, 1980, in Huntington Woods, Michigan, she rose to prominence playing the title character in cable TV's \"Veronica Mars\". Those who were won over by her breakthrough turn as feisty, teen detective-in-training Veronica Mars on the eponymous series (UPN, 2004-07) might have missed out the fact that she had already put down her roots in acting as a performer in musical theater. Bell appeared on Broadway twice before she was cast in the lead of the critically acclaimed TV series that generated a small, but loyal following over its three year run. In the meantime, she also had the chance to prove further her versatility in an outrageous tongue-in-cheek musical comedy adaptation of the cult 1936 anti-marijuana propaganda movie, \"Reefer Madness: The Musical\" (2005). Kristen Bell's looks and charisma could be again enjoyed with another regular primetime role of hers, this time playing an unusually talented but mentally unstable woman on the sci-fi phenomenon, \"Heroes\" (NBC, 2006-2010). Even though she has been pursuing a fledgling film career, the actress also made some brief dips into horror and little-seen indie comedy. While Bell's leading role in \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" (2008), on the other hand, launched her into romantic comedy career and bumped up her status to big league Hollywood productions. Later on, she took on roles in a such films as \"You Again\" (2010), \"Burlesque\" (2010) and Safety Not Guaranteed (2012), before getting back to the small screen playing the lead character, Jeannie van der Hooven, on \"House of Lies\" (Showtime, 2012- ). Bell became a true Internet sensation as she and Rob Thomas (\"Veronica Mars\" creator) raised $2 million via an online donation site called Kickstarter in an attempt to translate their signature show on the big screen. Kristen Bell graced the tabloid pages for whole other reasons, i.e., her high-profile relationship with actor Dax Shepard, who is now her husband and the father of her daughter Lincoln Bell Shepard.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-504136806-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Kristen-Bell.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-300x300/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Kristen-Bell.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/GettyImages-488355885-e1557100267439.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-167802829.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Robert-Downey-Jr.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brandon-Thomas-Lee.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/GettyImages-518601088-1.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1093667182.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-502228488.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/GettyImages-487452029.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-462918148.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Leonardo-DiCaprio.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Dax-Shepard.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tc.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1160570133.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Pamela-Anderson.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Tom-Hanks1-e1558999027688.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Jon-Favreau.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Katie-Holmes-e1557157753956.jpg"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Kristen-Bell.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/kristen-bell-net-worth/", "title": "Kristen Bell Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Kristen Bell Net Worth: Kristen Bell is an American actress, dancer, singer and film producer who has a net worth of $20 million dollars.
