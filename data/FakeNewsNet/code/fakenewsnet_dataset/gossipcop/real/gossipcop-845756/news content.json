The duo, however, were handed the wrong envelope: Instead of receiving one with the best picture winner, they received a redundant envelope naming Emma Stone as best actress for La La Land. (Two complete sets of winners\u2019 envelopes were present, with one held on each side of the stage.)\n\nBeatty was visibly perplexed by the card and showed it to Dunaway, who thought he was hamming it up.\n\n\u201cHe took the card out, and he didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Dunaway told Holt. \u201cHe paused, he looked over me, offstage, he looked around, and I finally said, \u2018You\u2019re impossible.\u2019 I thought he was joking. I mean, I thought he was stalling. Warren\u2019s like that. He kind of holds the power and makes you wait \u2026 but it\u2019s part of his charm.\u201d\n\nNot noticing Stone\u2019s name on the card, Dunaway announced La La Land as best picture, and it took two minutes \u2014 and two and a half acceptance speeches \u2014 for the error to be corrected. Both the film academy and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which tabulates the votes and manages the envelopes, apologized for the snafu.\n\nWatch a clip from Dunaway\u2019s interview above.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/episode-ix.jpg?crop=0px%2C174px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/eo_still_044.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-645725604.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/crl13120r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/midsommar-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/elvis.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1047855410.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mcdfaof_ec021.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/harry-met-sally-4-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C305px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/m_02145_rc.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/viola-davis-chadwick-boseman.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-645725604.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/paradise-hills.jpg?crop=100px%2C0px%2C2800px%2C1470px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/scary-stories.jpg?crop=328px%2C0px%2C2343px%2C1230.075px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kevin-smith-kevin-jason-mewes-jay.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/df-07191_07189_r_v3.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/betty-gilpin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/michell-rodriguez-fast-and-furious-6.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nivola.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coon-grace-wolfhard-1-2000x1333.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0eb7e2916ce488effba1c7f6b44706e1?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/split-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-645725604.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Oliver Gettell"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/", "title": "Faye Dunaway felt 'very guilty' after Oscars mixup", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Faye Dunaway, Oscars mixup, Faye Dunaway Oscars mixup", "news_keywords": "Faye Dunaway, Oscars mixup, Faye Dunaway Oscars mixup", "description": "Faye Dunaway addresses the Oscars mishap that led to 'La La Land' being mistakenly announced as best picture.", "og": {"title": "Faye Dunaway Felt 'Very Guilty' After Oscars Mixup", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/", "description": "Faye Dunaway has broken her public silence about\u00a0the Oscars mishap\u00a0that led to her and Warren Beatty mistakenly\u00a0announcing La La Land\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-645725604.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/", "description": "Faye Dunaway addresses the Oscars mishap that led to 'La La Land' being mistakenly announced as best picture.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-645725604.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/", "title": "Faye Dunaway Felt 'Very Guilty' After Oscars Mixup", "description": "Faye Dunaway addresses the Oscars mishap that led to 'La La Land' being mistakenly announced as best picture.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-645725604.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493006400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
