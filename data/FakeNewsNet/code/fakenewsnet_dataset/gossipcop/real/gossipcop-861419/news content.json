Jennifer Lopez and Taylor Swift have both taken turns sparking buzz, and now Zo\u00eb Kravitz has revealed that she and Drake \u201chung out for a minute.\u201d\n\nSitting down for a chat on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Kravitz was ready and willing to answer questions from the audience when a caller asked about her rumored relationship with Drake. (The pair were linked back in 2013 after being spotted kissing at a Beyonc\u00e9 concert.) Staying calm, cool, and collected, she admitted, \u201cWe hung out for a minute. Ya know.\u201d\n\nWhen the host prodded her a little more, she laughed, saying, \u201cWe hung out a little bit.\u201d As Cohen waggled his eyebrows suggestively, the actress refused to clarify exactly what was involved during her maybe-fling with Drake.\n\nWe may have to accept that we won\u2019t get any more juicy deets about their possible romance, but she did admit, \u201cHe\u2019s a cutie.\u201d\n\nThough, if you\u2019re hoping that something might spark between these two in the future, Kravitz told Complex in 2015 that anything folks might have witnessed between them was merely because she\u2019s \u201cvery flirtatious.\u201d She added that when it comes to Drake, \u201cHe\u2019s family to me.\u201d Too bad. They\u2019d definitely make a cute couple.\n\nAre you surprised that there was once maybe something between Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Drake?
