The order also states that he must stay away from her kids\u2019 school.\n\nSweeney, 40, has said in the past that LuVisi has tried to extort money from her and consistently threatened her. He also implied that he and the Days star were having an affair. (Sweeney has been married to California Highway Patrol officer David Sanov since 2000.)\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to take any chances, especially when LuVisi allegedly sent her messages like \u201cB***h you better answer me,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t push me. Your really starting to piss me off,\u201d and \u201cYou can\u2019t hide from me you sorry ass b***h.\u201d\n\nSweeney says that every time she tried to block LuVisi from contacting her, he would just make up a new account and continue the harassment. She also claims that somehow LuVisi discovered her home address and posted it to the internet.\n\nREAD MORE: Daniel Dae Kim comes clean about his \u2018Hawaii Five-O\u2019 exit\n\nLast month, Sweeney contacted the CHP (where her husband works) and the organization conducted a joint investigation with Oklahoma Law Enforcement.\n\nThe authorities spoke with LuVisi\u2019s wife, who said that her husband had become \u201cinfatuated\u201d with Sweeney and that she had considered divorce earlier in the year because of \u201chis obsession.\u201d\n\nSweeney was the host of The Biggest Loser from 2007 until 2015, and she recently returned to Days in her former role of Sami Brady (she debuted in the role in 1993, then left to host Loser).\n\nShe has been nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series (2015) and won the Special Fan Emmy Award for America\u2019s Favourite Villain in 2002. To date, Sweeney has appeared in almost 1,800 episodes of Days.", "images": ["https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/chy102175254_high.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/621/75/hkprotests.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/774/979/THURS_848x480_1569553475886.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/21434329.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1003048220.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/chris-j.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=55&h=55&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/674/835/TH_YT_MAN_WANTED_FOR_ROBBERY_848x480_1563006019558.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/alison-sweeney.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rcmp-pelican-narrows-youth-arrest.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/images/gnlive-ads/default.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/21434329.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/alison-sweeney.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=282", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005670&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/9572838.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1003048220.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_5882-e1562605151708.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/ad-choices.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/kroeker.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/19617757-e1535073439213.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/21434329.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stock-floor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1003048220.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/social-impulse/large/alerts/alerts.gif", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/raw_3gr0_botanical_sexism_1.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/logos/news_2x.png", "https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/495/99/STAMPEDE%20BACKLASH-PKG_CALG5173_1.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/36/615/2019-07-12T05-05-04.1Z--1280x720.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/alison-sweeney.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Jancelewicz", "National Online Supervisor"], "canonical_link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3579013/alison-sweeney-restraining-order-fan/", "title": "Alison Sweeney, \u2018Days of Our Lives\u2019 star, granted restraining order for \u2018obsessed\u2019 fan", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#133F6F", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Alison Sweeney, \u2018Days of Our Lives\u2019 star, granted restraining order for \u2018obsessed\u2019 fan -
