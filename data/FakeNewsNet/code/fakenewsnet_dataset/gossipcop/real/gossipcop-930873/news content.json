The Swedish Academy is the body that awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nMr Arnault\u2019s lawyer, Bj\u00f6rn Hurtig, told The Telegraph: \u201cMy client most strongly denies these allegations. He claims that these malicious rumors serve a single purpose; to blacken his name and damage him.\u201d Hurtig has yet to respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for further comment.\n\nOne of the princess\u2019s aides forcibly removed Arnault\u2019s hand from Victoria\u2019s buttocks, according to reports in Svenska Dagbladet and other local media outlets, including Sweden\u2019s national broadcaster STV, who cited multiple sources.\n\nImage zoom Pascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\n\u201cHe was lurking behind (her) and I saw his hand land on her neck and go down. All the way down,\u201d Ebba Witt-Brattstr\u00f6m, a 64-year-old scholar in comparative literature, said.\n\nOne of the Victoria\u2019s female assistants immediately neutralized the situation, Witt-Brattstr\u00f6m added.\n\n\u201cShe just flew at Arnault. She grabbed him and pushed him away,\u201d Witt-Brattstr\u00f6m told Sweden\u2019s Expressen newspaper. \u201cThe Crown Princess turned in surprise. I guess she had never been groped. She just looked like \u2018What?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt the time of the alleged incident, Arnault was 59 years old, and Crown Princess Victoria was 27.\n\nImage zoom Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Per Westerberg arrive at the 2006 Nobel Foundation Gala on December 10, 2006 in Stockholm Pascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\nIn November 2017, the Swedish Academy was rocked by allegations made by 18 women claiming that Arnault had either groped or harassed them at a cultural center he ran or at Swedish Academy-owned apartments in Stockholm and Paris.\n\nFrench-born Arnault, 71, is currently married to former Swedish Academy member Katarina Frostenson, 65. He denies all accusations made against him. No criminal charges have been filed.\n\nImage zoom Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden at the 2006 Nobel Foundation Gala Pascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\nSweden\u2019s Royal Palace has not officially commented on the incident, but has previously indicated its support for the #MeToo campaign. Crown Princess Victoria, now 40, and her mother Queen Sylvia both personally visited a Stockholm theatre presenting actress\u2019 accounts of sexual harassment within the entrainment industry in November 2017.\n\nAt that time, Princess Victoria told local media that #MeToo was \u201can extremely important campaign.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

Technically none can resign as they are life-long appointments \u2014 but they also cannot be forced to participate in the Academy\u2019s activities, including the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\u201cAfter our next Thursday meeting there will most probably be a statement on whether we will award a prize this year or reserve it for next year, in which case two prizes for literature will be announced in October 2019,\u201d Per W\u00e4stberg, a committee spokesman, told The Guardian.\n\nA decision will likely be announced early next week, he added.", "images":
