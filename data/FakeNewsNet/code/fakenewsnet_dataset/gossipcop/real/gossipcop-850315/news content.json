The flagship \u201cVampire\u201d series signed off this spring, ending its eight season run, so renewing \u201cOriginals\u201d keeps the franchise at the network for at least another season.\n\n\u201cOriginals\u201d follows Joseph Morgan\u2019s Klaus Mikaelson and his family in New Orleans. Morgan stars alongside Daniel Gillies, Phoebe Tonkin, Charles Michael Davis, Yusuf Gatewood and Riley Voelkel. Plec serves as executive producer with Leslie Morgenstein. The series hails from Bonanza Productions Inc., My So-Called Company, Alloy Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios.\n\nThe show has remained relatively stable in its fourth season, which is currently averaging a 0.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 972,000 viewers per episode. That represents a decrease of just 11% in the key demo and a slight increase in total viewers compared to Season 3.\n\n\u201ciZombie\u201d is based on the characters from DC Entertainment\u2019s Vertigo imprint. Rose McIver toplines the series, and stars alongside Malcolm Goodwin, Rahul Kohli, Robert Buckley, David Anders and Aly Michalka. The show hails from \u201cVeronica Mars\u201d creator Rob Thomas, who executive produces with Diane Ruggiero-Wright, Danielle Stokdyk and Dan Etheridge. Bonanza Productions Inc., Spondoolie Productions and Warner Bros. Television produce the series.\n\nNow in its third season, this supernatural procedural has dipped quite a bit in ratings. Midway through Season 3, it is averaging a 0.3 rating and 905,000 viewers per episode, down over 30% in both measures from Season 2.\n\nWith both renewals, the CW has officially made decisions for every returning show for the 2017-2018 season. \u201cOriginals\u201d and \u201ciZombie\u201d join already-renewed series \u201cArrow,\u201d \u201cD.C.\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow,\u201d \u201cThe Flash,\u201d \u201cSupergirl,\u201d \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d and \u201cSupernatural.\u201d The network cancelled freshman series \u201cNo Tomorrow\u201d and \u201cFrequency.\u201d", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
