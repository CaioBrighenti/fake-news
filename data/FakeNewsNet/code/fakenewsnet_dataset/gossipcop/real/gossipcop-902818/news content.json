{"url": "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/conditioner/guide/over-conditioning", "text": "What's over-conditioning?\n\nEach time you use conditioner, you're coating your hair in a new layer of product. If you over-condition your hair, each the cuticle will be heavily coated, making it impossible for other products, such as serums and oils, to penetrate and work effectively.\n\nOver-conditioning can occur in several ways:\n\nHow can I tell if I'm over-conditioning my hair?\n\nIf you have thick and dry hair, over-conditioning may seem impossible. However, product build-up is possible on any hair type. You'll notice your hair becoming unmanageable, soft, limp, or flat. Any sort of updo will be impossible, as your hair has no natural grip.\n\nOver-conditioning thin, fine hair weighs it down and makes it look oily and perhaps stringy. It's probably easier to see signs of over-conditioning on this hair type.\n\nMy hair is over-conditioned. What can I do?\n\nThe best way to tackle over-conditioned hair is to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product build-up. Christophe Robin Clarifying Shampoo is perfect at reviving over-conditioned hair and making it more manageable.\n\nYou can also try a clarifying scrub such as Christophe Robin Cleansing Purifying Scrub. Exfoliating your scalp once a week will help prevent product build-up that blocks follicles and leads to itchiness and a greasy feeling.\n\nIf your hair has become soft and limp due to over-conditioning, consider a protein treatment. Proteins help to strengthen and stiffen each hair strand to add texture back into the hair. We recommend evo mane attention protein treatment 150ml.\n\nHow can I prevent over-conditioning?\n\nTo prevent over-conditioning, it's important to use the right amount of conditioner and rinse it out thoroughly. Building a clarifying shampoo or scalp scrub into your regular routine will also help to stop product build-up. Conditioning is a crucial step to achieving healthy, beautiful hair, regardless of your hair types. However, conditioning is also a step that has to be carefully monitored and managed for best results. If you see signs of over-conditioned hair, it's important to remove the gunk to retain gorgeous locks.", "images":
