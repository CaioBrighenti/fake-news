In her first televised performance since splitting from the band Fifth Harmony, Cabello performed \"Crying In The Club\" at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards on Sunday night, and she absolutely rocked it. The performance was literally fire, as flames and smoke rose from the stage as she belted out her new single. The former member of 5H was accompanied by a crew of dancers, who totally got down to her song.\n\nWhen Cabello began her performance on the T-Mobile Arena stage in Las Vegas, the singer started with a verse from her other new single \"I Have Questions,\" before dancing among the flames to \"Crying in the Club.\" She commanded the stage in a way that'll make you forget that she was ever even part of a group.\n\nCabello's solo debut single dropped last week, and it will be on her solo EP The Hurting, The Healing, The Loving, so this is a truly exciting time for her and her fans. She left Fifth Harmony back in December 2016, and began pursuing a career as a solo artist afterwards. Cabello's new songs and her BBMAs performance show she is indeed ready to make it big on her own.\n\nCabello's final performances with Fifth Harmony aired as part of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on Dec. 31, 2016 in segments taped before she announced her departure. The group has since performed without her on TV, but finally, fans got to see Cabello strut her stuff on her own \u2014 and it seems like she has an impressive future ahead.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/22/682777364.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/22/682777364.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://cdn.bustle.com/bustle/production/public/loading-d7a38c.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/2017/5/22/682777364.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/camila-cabellos-crying-in-the-club-performance-at-the-billboard-music-awards-was-fire-video-59357", "title": "Camila Cabello's \"Crying In The Club\" Performance At The Billboard Music Awards Was Fire \u2014 VIDEO", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@bustle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 132694503601208}, "og": {"site_name": "Bustle", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/camila-cabellos-crying-in-the-club-performance-at-the-billboard-music-awards-was-fire-video-59357", "type": "article", "title": "Camila Cabello Rocks The BBMAs Stage", "description": "Camila Cabello officially made her TV debut as a solo artist.
