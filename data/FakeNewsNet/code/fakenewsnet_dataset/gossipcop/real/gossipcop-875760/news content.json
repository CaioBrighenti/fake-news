They share three kids together: daughter Vivianne Rose, 4, and sons Eric Jr., 3, and Forrest, 6 months.\n\nWhile Jessie didn\u2019t respond to the Twitter rumors, she has made it all-too clear what would happen if Eric did stray.\n\n\u201cSometimes I like to send pictures to Eric with little reminders of what would happen if he ever cheated,\u201d the 30-year-old country star wrote on Instagram nearly 2 years ago, captioning a photo of a big knife and chopped sausages. \u201cHope everyone has a good day.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jessie James Decker Reveals How She Keeps the \u2018Spice Alive\u2019 with Husband Eric & Why \u2018Date Night Is So Important\n\nAll teasing aside, Jessie has previously raved about the strength of her bond with her husband, telling PEOPLE in September 2017 that they \u201chave grown together\u2026beautifully.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just like each other and we always have and it continues to strengthen,\u201d Jessie said. \u201cI think we\u2019re such great parents together \u2014 I could not have picked a better partner to have kids with.

Men want to feel good \u2014 they want to feel like their women love them. When they come home from work, don\u2019t start nagging them with questions. Go up to them and give them a big kiss and ask them how their day was.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Matt Winkelmeyer/ACMA2017/Getty Images\n\nShe continued: \u201cLittle things like that go such a long way and I think sometimes women forget that. But also, I know he appreciates a nice physique, so I try to work out for him because I know that fitness is important to him, obviously in his field. And he will shave his beard once in a while for me, so we try to work on that.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Eric and Jessie James Decker, and kids Jessie James Decker/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Eric and Jessie James Decker Welcome Son Forrest Bradley\n\nMeanwhile, Eric and Jessie will have plenty of time for workouts and date nights now that he\u2019s retired from the NFL after an eight-season career.\n\nThe athlete announced his retirement on Aug. 26 after playing for the Denver Broncos, New York Jets, Tennessee Titans and signing a one-year contract with the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cIt has been my childhood dream and my passion to play the game of football.
