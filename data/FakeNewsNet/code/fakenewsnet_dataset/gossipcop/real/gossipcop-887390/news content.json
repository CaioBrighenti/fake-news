Up Next \u00d7 SHARE COPY LINK On Oct. 11, great Pyrenees Odin, who survived the Tubbs Fire and saved the family's goats and even deer, reunites with his pup sister, Tessa.\n\nRead a Thursday night update on Odin here.\n\nWith flames encroaching on their property, a Santa Rosa man and his family had only minutes to evacuate. But they had plenty of animals to get to safety, too, one of which refused to leave others behind.\n\nRoland Tembo Hendel and his family had to flee as their property sits near Mark West Springs Road, an area highly impacted by the Tubbs Fire.\n\nSanta Rosa ordered mandatory evacuations of residents in affected areas at 10 a.m. Oct. 9.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to The Sacramento Bee content across all your devices. SAVE NOW\n\n\u201cIt was about 10:30 when we first smelled smoke from the approaching Tubbs fire that has ravaged Northern California,\u201d Hendel says in his account on Facebook. \u201cI ran up and down our roads on the ATV, but saw nothing. At 10:55 I could see the sky turning orange. ...\n\n\u201cBy 11:10 we could see the first of the flames across the valley. By 11:15 they were growing larger and the winds went mad.\u201d\n\nThe family had to quickly load up as many animals as possible, including dogs and cats, but their great Pyrenees Odin refused to join them if it meant leaving the family\u2019s eight bottle-fed rescue goats behind.\n\n\u201cI made a decision to leave him, and I doubt I could have made him come with us if I tried,\u201d Hendel says. \u201cWe got out with our lives and what was in our pockets.\u201d\n\nHe described cars behind theirs pouring flames out of the windows in an attempt to outrun the fire.\n\n\u201cWhen we had found relative safety we cried for Odin and our goats,\u201d Hendel says on the family\u2019s YouCaring page. \u201cI was sure I had sentenced them to a horrific and agonizing death.\u201d\n\nDays later, the family was able to return to the property to see what remained.\n\nTo their disbelief, Odin \u2013 burned and battered but still alive \u2013 was there surrounded by the goats and small deer. It appeared that even the deer had sought him out for safety.\n\nThe goats came running up to the family for cuddles and kisses in the touching reunion.\n\nThe family\u2019s pump house was destroyed, leaving them without fresh water. And all of the structures on the property were \u201cdecimated.\u201d\n\nThe story has touched so many people that the family\u2019s YouCaring campaign has already surpassed its goal of $45,000.\n\nThe family says Odin lived up to his namesake \u2013 a Norse god.\n\n\u201cHe is our inspiration,\u201d says Hendel.\n\n\u201cEven now as i write this, I am crying tears of gratitude and awe at his bravery and devotion.\u201d", "images": ["https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557042001/c4237a4c-9c91-490e-ad7b-807843ca13b8/2e1e08ea-4874-4877-86b1-640c376838d9/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/7qjo3w/picture231704263/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/CampFire_HA_181108_0019%20(1).JPG", "https://www.fresnobee.com/opinion/op-ed/ijnoua/picture231751733/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/wildfire", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://www.modbee.com/latest-news/nn66ax/picture232560012/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/modena%20and%20daughter.jpg", "https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/iaad6s/picture231704268/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/IMG_wine_country_fire_3_1_2TDU1F0S_L397332357", "https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/8i9cte/picture231953648/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_DMK_6142", "https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/j0db1s/picture230199264/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/SAC_PK_PARADISE_0708.JPG", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/logo.svg", "https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=5771&contextPath=3181-5771&pubId=8&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=179237671&type=article&title=Dog+refuses+to+leave+rescue+goats+during+fire%2C+ends+up+saving+them+and+deer&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sacbee.com%2Fnews%2Fstate%2Fcalifornia%2Ffires%2Farticle179237671.html", "https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/gmkrp3/picture229399294/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/SAC_RCB_20190412_PARADISE28"], "top_img": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557042001/c4237a4c-9c91-490e-ad7b-807843ca13b8/2e1e08ea-4874-4877-86b1-640c376838d9/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kalin Kipling"], "canonical_link": "http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/fires/article179237671.html", "title": "Wine country fires: Odin the Pyrenees dog saves goats, deer", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/sacbee/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "sacbee_news", "title": "Dog refuses to leave rescue goats during fire, ends up saving them and deer", "description": "Odin the great Pyrenees refused to leave goats behind and ended up ensuring everyone, including deer, survived the Tubbs Fire", "image": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557042001/c4237a4c-9c91-490e-ad7b-807843ca13b8/2e1e08ea-4874-4877-86b1-640c376838d9/1280x720/match/image.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "sacbee", "type": "article", "title": "Dog refuses to leave rescue goats during fire, ends up saving them and deer", "url": "https://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/fires/article179237671.html", "description": "Odin the great Pyrenees refused to leave goats behind and ended up ensuring everyone, including deer, survived the Tubbs Fire", "image": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/5502557042001/c4237a4c-9c91-490e-ad7b-807843ca13b8/2e1e08ea-4874-4877-86b1-640c376838d9/1280x720/match/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 832188313608327, "pages": 21595906224}, "title": "Wine country fires: Odin the Pyrenees dog saves goats, deer | The Sacramento Bee", "allow-comments": "true", "description": "Odin the great Pyrenees refused to leave goats behind and ended up ensuring everyone, including deer, survived the Tubbs Fire", "keywords": "santa rosa, fire, odin, dog, pyrenees, goats, deer, sonoma, county, napa, tubbs, news, north, northern, ca, cal, california, wine country", "news_keywords": "santa rosa, fire, odin, dog, pyrenees, goats, deer, sonoma, county, napa, tubbs, news, north, northern, ca, cal, california, wine country", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "original-source": "http://www.sacbee.com/news/state/california/fires/article179237671.html", "google-site-verification": "Q9gAoI5aCJRTixPw10OshUcjq4BF49M__7o-TS4M3zc", "parsely-metadata": "{\"article_id\": \"179237671\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.sacbee.com", "summary": ""}
