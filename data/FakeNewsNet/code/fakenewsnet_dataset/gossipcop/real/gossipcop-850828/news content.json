And when it comes to balance, the four-time Emmy-nominated star says she taps into her Scandal character Olivia Pope for inspiration.\n\n\u201cWe will not fail. We will not go down. We will fight the fight. There\u2019s always a solution,\u201d she says, adding that the words have \u201csapped into [her] bloodstream\u201d after she has said them so many times.\n\n\u201cNow I feel that way,\u201d Washington shares. \u201cI wake up, I have a house full of kids and pets, a new production company, I\u2019m number one on the call sheet, and I think: \u2018I will not go down. There\u2019s always another way.\u2019 \u201c\n\nFROM PEN: Supermodel Christie Brinkley is 63 and back in SI\u2018s Swimsuit Issue with Her Daughters!\n\nOne person who helps her keep her goals in line? Scandal showrunner Shonda Rhimes, who is a known supporter of working moms across her many projects.\n\n\u201cShonda\u2019s got I-don\u2019t-know-how-many shows now, plus three kids, and she just figures it out,\u201d Washington explains. \u201cHowever busy I feel, Shonda feels busier, so I\u2019m just going to rise to the occasion.\u201d\n\nAdds the star, \u201cShe\u2019s been a real role model. Seeing the community she\u2019s created and the work ethic \u2013 I feel like there should be more of this in the world.\u201d", "images":
