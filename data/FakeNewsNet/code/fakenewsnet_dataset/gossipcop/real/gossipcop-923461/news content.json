The truth, though, is that a good chunk of them are swiping left and right just as often as the rest of us are.\n\nWant to know which celebrities you\u2019re most likely to see on one of your swipe binges, or at the very least the ones you may have glossed over in the past? Read on. And as they say, where there\u2019s smoke there\u2019s fire \u2014 in other words, these celebrities are hardly the only ones using dating apps.\n\n1. Amy Schumer\n\nWhile she ended up marrying someone else earlier this year, actress Amy Schumer admitted to meeting her ex-boyfriend Ben Hanisch on Tinder. \u201cIn my main profile picture, I was wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap with no makeup. It was a selfie and I made a gross face, looking as though I were dying, because I was hiking, so I was,\u201d Schumer wrote in her 2016 book of personal essays, \u201cThe Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo.\u201d \u201cI also put up a picture of Sophia from \u2018The Golden GIrls,\u2019 Claire Danes making her cry face on \u2018Homeland,\u2019 and one more normal more normal photo where I was smiling and wearing a sweatshirt. Vanessa [Bayer] and I posted our profiles at the same time and scream-giggled like little girls.\u201d\n\n2. Adam Rippon\n\nEarlier this year, figure skater Adam Rippon revealed that he met his boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala, on Tinder. He told People that the relationship was still \u201cfresh\u201d \u2014 but that he\u2019s \u201cfresh,\u201d too. \u201c[We\u2019ve] been talking for the past seven months\u201d and then \u201cstarted to hang out a little bit more, because we were both really busy,\u201d Rippon said in April.\n\n3. Demi Lovato\n\nIn her 2017 documentary \u201cDemi Lovato: Simply Complicated,\u201d Lovato opened up about using dating apps to connect with both men and women. \u201cI am open to human connection, so whether that\u2019s through a male or a female, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\n\n4. Katy Perry\n\nIn between her concerts and epic shoe collection, it appears that pop star Katy Perry also finds time to swipe. After Perry called it quits with fellow musician John Mayer back in 2014, Perry had the perfect response when asked if she was single by Power 105.1\u2019s The Breakfast Club. \u201cI\u2019m really deep on Tinder, so I don\u2019t have a lot of time,\u201d she said.\n\n5. Laverne Cox\n\nYou\u2019ve seen her on \u201cOrange Is The New Black,\u201d and you probably follow her on Instagram. And if you\u2019re so inclined, you can also look for her on Tinder. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m a Tinder girl. When I broke up with my ex, I went back on Tinder, because I feel like if you want to date, you have to be on the apps,\u201d Cox told Natalie Morales and Kit Hoover while on \u201cAccess\u201d in March. \u201cYou have to be on the apps to be in the game.\u201d She admitted that she\u2019s also \u201cgood at screening,\u201d because she\u2019s been \u201cinternet dating\u201d for a long time now.\n\n6. Zac Efron\n\nWant to make your high school dreams come true? See if you can find \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d star Zac Efron on Tinder. If you swipe right, he\u2019ll be thrilled. \u201cAmazingly, when I signed up for Tinder, nobody swiped me!\u201d Efron told the British Newspaper The Times in 2016. \u201cThey thought [my profile] was fake.\u201d\n\nSwiping left on Zac Efron sounds like a mistake we\u2019d never get over.\n\n7. Chelsea Handler\n\nAsk talk show host Chelsea Handler how she feels about dating apps, and she\u2019ll tell you she\u2019s all about them. \u201cOh, I\u2019m on all those apps,\u201d Handler told ET\u2019s Nischelle Turner. \u201cI like to hook up, so when I go to London or New York or if I\u2019m out of town and I want, I\u2019ll do that \u2026 I\u2019m on Tinder [and] all that stuff. I\u2019m a regular person.\u201d\n\n8. Hilary Duff\n\nWith baby no. 2 on the way and a starring role on the TV show \u201cYounger,\u201d there\u2019s no doubt that Hilary Duff is a busy young woman. But back in 2015, she revealed to Ryan Seacrest that she was on Tinder after speculation that her profile was fake. \u201cIt kind of started out to be a joke with my girlfriends. I was like, \u2018Explain this whole thing to me because it\u2019s kind of blowing my mind,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIn my life, I\u2019ve always had really serious boyfriends, I\u2019ve always met people through work, and I\u2019ve never been on a blind date.\u201d\n\n9. Lindsay Lohan\n\nSure, it\u2019s been a while since 2013 \u2014 but five years ago, Lindsay Lohan was so immersed in the online dating world that she actually found her brother on Tinder. \u201cLook who I just found on @tinderapp \u2026 hey bro,\u201d Lohan wrote in an Instagram caption.\n\n10. Charlize Theron\n\nWhile on \u201cThe Ellen Degeneres Show,\u201d Charlize Theron opened up about the hilarious way Chelsea Handler convinced her to sign up for a dating app. \u201cShe was on her phone and she showed it to me and she was explaining it to me in that Chelsea Handler way, which is just like, \u2018Yeah, everybody\u2019s doing this. What\u2019s wrong with you? Where have you been, under a rock?\u2019\u201d Theron said. \u201cSo then I took real interest, and I was like, okay, well tell me, how does it work? And she\u2019s swiping all these faces of guys in all different sorts of \u2014 I\u2019m going to sound like I\u2019m 80. But they\u2019re in all sorts of different variations of no clothes, and then they know that you\u2019ve just said no, I don\u2019t like you.\u201d\n\nWe get it, Charlize.", "images":
