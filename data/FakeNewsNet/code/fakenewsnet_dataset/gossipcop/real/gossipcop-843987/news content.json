Abrams\u2019 Star Wars: Episode IX, and unofficially told racist, sexist internet trolls to eat shit as the announcement included the return of actress Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico.\n\nThe film begins shooting in London\u2019s Pinewood Studios on August 1, and will be released in theaters in December 2019.\n\nEarlier this summer, Tran deleted her only few social media accounts after a harassment campaign was carried out by a bunch of racist, sexist turd-golems who hated Rian Johnson\u2019s Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Instead of being normal people and doing anything else, these internet trolls opted to berate members of the cast and crew, with Tran receiving the brunt of their efforts.\n\nThere isn\u2019t proof, but a Facebook group with the unwieldy name \u201cDown With Disney\u2019s Treatment of Franchises and Its Fanboys\u201d claimed responsibility for the online harassment. Given that Tran is one of the franchise\u2019s few female characters of color (she is Vietnamese-American), of course things erred on the vile side of things.\n\nIn a statement that\u2019s since been deleted, the group lamented the \u201cforced diversity\u201d of the franchise and sought to \u201cBring back the Straight White Male Hero,\u201d even though that\u2019s not a thing that can go away. But they sure wanted to make Star Wars great again. Luckily, Tran isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\n'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (2017)\n\nFor Star Wars IX, Tran rejoins franchise vets like Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), and Billy Dee Williams (back as Lando Calrissian), and her fellow new era hitters Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Adam Driver, Lupita N\u2019yongo, and Oscar Isaac. The late Carrie Fisher, who died in 2016, will return through unused footage filmed for 2015\u2019s The Force Awakens.\n\nStar Wars: Episode IX will be released in December 2019.", "images": ["https://fsmedia.imgix.net/e9/8a/ca/07/feee/4912/aa37/381373769211/star-wars-the-last-jedi-2017.jpeg?rect=0%2C0%2C5760%2C2884&auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&w=650", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dsZ5hTqk9YtgS.gif", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=19987187&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://alb.reddit.com/snoo.gif?q=CAAHAAABAAoACQAAAAACWQ1QAA==&s=XEpByt_R434fqqGl0DfctKqGILDzrA7eDqfNEeDOv7E=", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/assets/placeholder.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/e9/8a/ca/07/feee/4912/aa37/381373769211/star-wars-the-last-jedi-2017.jpeg?rect=0%2C0%2C5760%2C2884&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1200", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1455869871397255&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=275370&fmt=gif", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/assets/logo_desktop.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&w=246"], "top_img": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/e9/8a/ca/07/feee/4912/aa37/381373769211/star-wars-the-last-jedi-2017.jpeg?rect=0%2C0%2C5760%2C2884&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inverse.com/article/47543-star-wars-episode-9-kelly-marie-tran-returns-as-rose-tico", "title": "'Star Wars 9': Sorry Trolls, Kelly Marie Tran Is Coming Back", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "description": "A harassment campaign carried out by garbage fans couldn't stop Rose Tico.
