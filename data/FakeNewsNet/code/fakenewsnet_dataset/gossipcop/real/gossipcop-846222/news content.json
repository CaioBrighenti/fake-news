It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know!\u201d quipped Grimshaw, before beginning to really question the star. \u201cCan we talk about that? What the hell? We\u2019ve got to talk about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been talked about so much. I\u2019m over it already,\u201d Bloom replied, but Grimshaw refused to let the subject go, and revealed the paddle boarding session was the second result for \u201cOrlando Bloom\u201d on search engine Google.\n\n\u201cGreat, man,\u201d the 40-year-old commented. \u201cFantastic.\u201d\n\nBloom then lamented the fact his six-year-old son Flynn, with ex-wife Miranda Kerr, will one day also be teased about the pictures, too.\n\n\u201cMy poor son \u2013 he\u2019s got a lot to live up to!\u201d he cringed, before joking about the popularity of the photos, adding, \u201cI broke the Internet!\u201d\n\nBloom previously insisted he was \u201cextremely\u201d surprised to discover the paparazzi had uncovered his vacation location with pop star Katy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have put myself in that position if I\u2019d thought it would happen,\u201d he told Elle U.K. \u201cI\u2019ve been photographed a million times in a million different ways. I have a good radar. We\u2019d been completely alone for five days \u2013 nothing around us. There was no way anyone could get anything. I had a moment of feeling free.\n\n\u201cWhat can I tell you?\u201d he continued. \u201cNote to self: You\u2019re never free.
