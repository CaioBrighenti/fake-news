It is a milestone all traveling parents hit. When it comes though, it is often hard to find the perfect bookbag. Bags for toddlers need to be small enough to actually fit on a kid and yet hold enough to justify getting a kid his own bag.\n\nIt is always best to check measurements as many of these bags are the perfect size for toddlers but may be too small to last them until school. Most of these brands make a larger size, but we have recommended the best size for toddlers.\n\nWe turned to the traveling parents in Club Bebe Voyage for their recommendations for the perfect bookbag for traveling toddlers. These bags are perfect for car trips, plane rides and even for day-to-day use at pre-school. We are sure you will find the perfect one to suit your family.\n\nSkip Hop | Skip Hop book bags are beloved. It could be the cute characters on the bags that are sure to win over any child. It has a mesh side pocket and a front zip pocket. There is a write-on name-tag, although we suggest you write the family e-mail address there just in case it gets lost. Our members were impressed with the padded straps, commenting on how much their kids loved wearing them.\n\nWith this cast of cute options you can even find the perfect one for each kid.\n\nNorth Face | The North Face Sprout is a great option for little kids. It has the quality you have come to expect from North Face packed into a little package perfect for a toddler. Sarah, club member and mom of two, loves that the North Face Sprout has a strap across the chest. She says \u201cit really helps keep it on when we load it down.\u201d\n\nFjallraven | The Fjallraven Mini has the iconic Scandinavian design and is the perfect size for toddlers. It is spacious and has a two way zip around so it\u2019s easy to access things without unzipping the whole bag. The Fjallraven has a front zip pocket as well as two side pouches. The X design straps make it ergonomic and easy to carry. Club mom Neeraja said this is your pick \u201cif you want to be super hipster!\u201d\n\nBeatrix New York | The Little Kid Pack by Beatrix New York are as cute as they come. B\u00e9b\u00e9 Voyage club member Sonia chose the Little Kid Pack when her little girl grew out of the Skip Hop bag. Sonia says to make sure you\u2019re purchasing the Little Kid option as the Big Kid Pack is a full size bookbag. These bags have a small interior pocket and padded shoulder straps and back.\n\nPottery Barn Kids | Pottery Barn offers a variety of bookbag options but the McKenzie series is a fan favorite. (Use their gear guide to figure out what is right for you.) The Small McKenzie is perfect for toddlers, although they reccomend you pop into the store to see which size best fits your kid. Parents love the exterior straps where you can add on a lunch box or even your child\u2019s coat when traveling. The prints are lovely and come in a wide variety including a few that glow in the dark.\n\nDinosaur Backpack | The Zhuannian Toddler Kids Dinosaur Backpack comes with an attached leash and fits even petit kids. B\u00e9b\u00e9 Voyage member, Sarah, started using it with her child at 18 months. It is the cheapest on our list ($15!) so it is perfect for a family that is not ready to commit. It has a chest strap and detachable leash.\n\nLittle Life | Little Life backpacks come in animal and Disney shapes. They have a detachable leash and a zip-top entry into the bag. Kids just love these. B\u00e9b\u00e9 Voyage member Daniella says her son \u201cabsolutely loves it. He loves packing his small toys, pacifiers and a small snack in there.\u201d\n\nVaude | The Vaude Ayla backpack is a must for kids who prefer to spend their time outdoors. Chelsea, a B\u00e9b\u00e9 Voyage club member, sends her little boy to forest school and says he uses it every day. She loves that they are \u201cwater resistant, [have] lots of pockets, places to store a drinking cup and easy to use buckles/flaps.\u201d\n\nJack Wolfskin | The Jack Wolfskin Buttercup Backpack is another perfect fit for toddlers. Club member Naz commented that she spent a lot of time researching bags and this was a clear winner for her, \u201cfrom back support to shoulder support and chest strap. My Montessori kindergarten has always highly recommended it.\u201d Naz is referring to the \u201csnuggle up\u201d system that keeps the bag lightweight and balanced just for little bodies. It comes in a range of colors.\n\nBackpack & Lovie Carrier | If your little one loves to bring along a little friend on your travels, why not try out a bag that can carry one?
