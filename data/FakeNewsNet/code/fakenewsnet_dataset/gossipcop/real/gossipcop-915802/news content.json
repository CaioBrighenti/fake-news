So, what exactly happened? Shortly after popping the question to Kufrin, Luyendyk Jr. began having doubts, and ultimately made the decision to end things with his newly minted fianc\u00e9e \u2014 on camera. As for his reasoning, Luyendyk Jr. admitted he wanted to give a relationship with runner-up Lauren Burnham a chance.\n\nOn After the Final Rose, Luyendyk Jr. and Burnham reunited, with the Bachelor getting down on one knee \u2014 once again \u2014 to propose to Burnham. She accepted.\n\n\u201cI was just like, \u2018We need to do it, you need to take the risk if this means a lot to you and you need to follow your heart,'\u201d Burnham recalled to PEOPLE, sharing that Luyendyk Jr. reached out to her while he and Kufrin were still engaged. \u201c\u2018If not, then we don\u2019t need to talk anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t think he thought through everything of how ending things with Lauren would be, how being engaged to me would be and what breaking up with me and going back to her would be,\u201d Kufrin told PEOPLE of the heartbreaking split. \u201cI don\u2019t think he thought it through, but I don\u2019t think he did it maliciously to break my heart.\u201d\n\nIn November 2018, Luyendyk Jr. and Burnham announced they are expecting their first child, a girl, and in January 2019, they tied the knot in Hawaii.\n\nDaughter Alessi was born on May 29, 2019.\n\n\u201cWe have a BEAUTIFUL baby girl 6 lbs, 13 oz. 20cm Long,\u201d the proud papa wrote on his Instagram story. \u201cMommy and baby are doing great, we are so incredibly happy.\u201d", "images":
