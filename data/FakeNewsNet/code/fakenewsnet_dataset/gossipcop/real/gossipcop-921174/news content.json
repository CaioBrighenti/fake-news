The animal rights group said a whistleblower provided the footage and that it was shot in November for a scene for \"Crazy Alien,\" which was filmed in China. The person said the director, Hao Ning, ordered two takes. TMZ quoted sources as saying that the dog did not appear to be injured, but was shaken up.\n\n\"I've just been made aware and seen a video from the set of a film I worked on in China,\" Morrison, who plays the lead character in the sci-fi comedy movie, tweeted on Thursday. \"My heart is broken to see any animal treated this way. Had I been on set or known about this, I would have made all efforts to stop this. I've called the producers to express my outrage.\"\n\nGlee's100 Most Memorable Moments.\n\nThe film's director and the China-based production company, Dirty Monkey Films Group, have not commented.\n\n\"PETA is urging the actors to hold the production accountable and calling for the public to boycott this film,\" the animal rights group said. \"This scene should be cut, and Ning should commit to never working with live animals again. We're asking that the cast--including \"Glee\" actor Matthew Morrison--donate their salaries to animal-protection charities in China.\"\n\nOriginal Post: Matthew Morrison Outraged by Alleged Dog Abuse Video Filmed for His Movie\n\n\u00a9 Copyright E!
