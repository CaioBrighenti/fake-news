(no one was home when I knocked this time lol),\u201d she captioned the photo of herself perched on the front stoop. \u201cI visit this place every chance I get. In many ways it very well could have been better than my life today, but I\u2019m grateful for a voice that can enable change today. Even when I don\u2019t know how to do it well or actually want it. I love you Grand Prairie. Thank you. \u2764\ufe0f\u201d\n\nGomez was born and raised in Grand Prairie, Texas, but made the move to Los Angeles when she was in her early teens after she landed the lead role of Alex Russo on Disney Channel\u2019s Wizards of Waverly Place. She currently resides in a $2.5 million ranch house in Studio City, California, that features three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms in the main house, with an additional bedroom and bathroom in a separate space that could be converted into a studio or guesthouse. The singer snapped up the 3,188-square-foot home last May after selling her Fort Worth, Texas, mansion in February of the same year. (The 10,000-square-foot home was listed for $3 million and featured 1.5 acres of extravagance, including a saltwater pool, a putting green, an outdoor kitchen and cabana, and a tennis and basketball court.)", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d13aa3e22d933000807f5c6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/AD070119_DISC_SHEERER_02.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-reverse.13d6d4955ed232771a3c921b77513eaddd3ac58b.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5a5634888cd38f3124c16df4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-876401954%2520(1).jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5a5634888cd38f3124c16df4/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-876401954%252520(1).jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0bb5dbaee3652331ac27ac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1140667378.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-header.4beb0fb9c7bbd6bb98b552777bf0f8c6e71764c1.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d28b0875f98920008fe0ecb/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ROHIGH%2520RES-28.JPG", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d24af27dfe2aa00080eccad/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/_DSC3517.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5a5631ff22989e6fe75ccc6e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/selena-gomez-01.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d03c47ec9f2f29878f26a88/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/designer-confessions-hotel-room-still.png", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d10fcf5620eebd2dd80d454/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/AD070119_SHARAPOVA_01.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0ba5bdbc9149483b1a1d61/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/image_h_04.jpeg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0a537254d1b1ec2a90f1e2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/image_h_01%2520(1).jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5a5634888cd38f3124c16df4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-876401954%2520(1).jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Jordi Lippe-Mcgraw", "Joyce Chen", "Rachel Wallace", "Joyce Che", "Mitchell Owens", "Angus Wilkie", "Mayer Rus", "Gay Gassmann"], "canonical_link": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/selena-gomez-says-she-visits-her-childhood-home-every-chance-i-get", "title": "Selena Gomez Says She Visits Her Childhood Home \"Every Chance I Get\"", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "The singer shared a photo of the house she grew up in in Grand Prairie, Texas, to her Instagram account along with a sweet sentiment", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "The singer shared a photo of the house she grew up in in Grand Prairie, Texas, to her Instagram account along with a sweet sentiment", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5a5634888cd38f3124c16df4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-876401954%2520(1).jpg", "site_name": "Architectural Digest", "title": "Selena Gomez Says She Visits Her Childhood Home &quot;Every Chance I Get&quot;", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/selena-gomez-says-she-visits-her-childhood-home-every-chance-i-get"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The singer shared a photo of the house she grew up in in Grand Prairie, Texas, to her Instagram account along with a sweet sentiment", "domain": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5a5634888cd38f3124c16df4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-876401954%2520(1).jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@ArchDigest", "title": "Selena Gomez Says She Visits Her Childhood Home &quot;Every Chance I Get&quot;"}, "fb": {"app_id": 267091300008193, "pages": 43794751042, "admins": 108943}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "summary": ""}
