De Lesseps, 52, was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 24 after attacking a police officer in Palm Beach \u2014 nearly a year after she wed now-ex-husband Tom D\u2019Agostino in the Florida destination.\n\nImage zoom\n\nShe was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nShe had been discovered trespassing in a hotel room with an unidentified man, according to a police report. The pair had entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave.\n\nAn assistant state\u2019s attorney told the Palm Beach Post that de Lesseps slammed a door and kicked at least one police officer. She also reportedly told people, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you all,\u201d before her arrest.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, de Lesseps \u2014 who was released on her own recognizance that same day \u2014 said, \u201cThis was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.\u201d\n\nA source told PEOPLE that \u201cLuann was out with a girlfriend at the Colony Hotel where she had her wedding brunch just a year ago \u2014 it was the first time she had been back to Palm Beach since the wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cMemories from that day came flooding back, she was emotional and her behavior was out of character,\u201d the source added.\n\nDays after her arrest, she exclusively told PEOPLE that she would be checking herself into a treatment facility.\n\n\u201cAfter the events of last Saturday night in Palm Beach, I am truly embarrassed,\u201d she said. \u201cI have decided to seek professional guidance and will be voluntarily checking into an alcohol treatment center. I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions. I have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters,\u201d she continued.", "images":
