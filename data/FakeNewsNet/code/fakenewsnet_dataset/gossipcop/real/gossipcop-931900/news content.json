She is repped by WME and Conway van Gelder Grant.\n\nWatkins, meanwhile, will play Harold Wilson. Wilson was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1970 and again from 1974 to 1976.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to become part of this exceptional show,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cAnd so thrilled to be working once again with Peter Morgan. Harold Wilson is a significant and fascinating character in our history. So looking forward to bringing him to life, through a decade that transformed us culturally and politically. And excited to be working so closely with Olivia; and the whole team.\u201d\n\nWatkins is a BAFTA Award winner known for his work on British television shows like \u201cBeing Human,\u201d \u201cTrollied,\u201d and the two-part drama \u201cThe Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies.\u201d He also recently appeared in the Tom Hardy-led drama series \u201cTaboo\u201d and will also appear in Terry Gilliam\u2019s film \u201cThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote.\u201d He is repped by United Agents.\n\nThe pair joins previously announced Season 3 cast members Olivia Colman, who will take over the role of Elizabeth from Claire Foy, and Tobias Menzies, who has been cast as Prince Philip after Matt Smith played the character in Seasons 1 and 2.\n\n\u201cThe Crown\u201d Season 3 is slated to debut in 2019. The series was created by Morgan and is produced by Left Bank Pictures.\n\nThe series recently found itself in the spotlight for the wrong reasons when it was revealed that Foy had been paid less for her work in the show than Smith. Left Bank revealed at a talk in Jerusalem on March 13 that Smith had received a higher pay cut, but added that going forward, \u201cno one gets paid more than the Queen.\u201d The company later issued a formal apology for the pay gap.\n\n\n\nPOPULAR ON VARIETY:", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
