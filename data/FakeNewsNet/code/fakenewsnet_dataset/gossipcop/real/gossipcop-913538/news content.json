She puts her money on Metta World Peace, despite the fact EW\u2019s own Dalton Ross postulated he might be the worst player \u201cever\u201d in the history of the game. Pulliam thinks that cluelessness might just be a stealth tactic, though, saying \u201cLet me tell you, I think they are completely sleeping on him\u2026 he said, \u2018The longer you all keep me, I\u2019m coming for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatch the clip above for more. The Talk airs weekdays on CBS.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/1568-angel_1200x6282.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2e8796fac4d868172fac0ab0310aeefe?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/angel2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/keshia-knight-pulliam.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/keshia-knight-pulliam.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maureen Lee Lenker"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/02/13/keshia-knight-pulliam-celebrity-big-brother-departure-the-talk/", "title": "Keshia Knight Pulliam's surprising pick for Celebrity Big Brother winner", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Keshia Knight Pulliam, Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity Big Brother exit, The Talk, celebrity big brother omarosa, omarosa, metta world peace", "news_keywords": "Keshia Knight Pulliam, Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity Big Brother exit, The Talk, celebrity big brother omarosa, omarosa, metta world peace", "description": "The former 'Cosby' star on getting back to her baby and throwing Shannon Elizabeth under the Celebrity Big Brother bus", "og": {"title": "Keshia Knight Pulliam's surprising pick for \u2018Celebrity Big Brother\u2019 winner", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/02/13/keshia-knight-pulliam-celebrity-big-brother-departure-the-talk/", "description": "The former 'Cosby' star on getting back to her baby and throwing Shannon Elizabeth under the 'Celebrity Big Brother' bus", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/keshia-knight-pulliam.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/02/13/keshia-knight-pulliam-celebrity-big-brother-departure-the-talk/", "description": "The former 'Cosby' star on getting back to her baby and throwing Shannon Elizabeth under the Celebrity Big Brother bus", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/keshia-knight-pulliam.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/02/13/keshia-knight-pulliam-celebrity-big-brother-departure-the-talk/", "title": "Keshia Knight Pulliam's surprising pick for \u2018Celebrity Big Brother\u2019 winner", "description": "The former 'Cosby' star on getting back to her baby and throwing Shannon Elizabeth under the Celebrity Big Brother bus", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/keshia-knight-pulliam.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518498000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
