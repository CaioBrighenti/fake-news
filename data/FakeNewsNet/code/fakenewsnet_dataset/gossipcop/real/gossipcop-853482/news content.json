Ramona elaborated on their issues and gave a hint as to what's to come on the reunion when talking to Daryn Carp on Bravo's Weekly Pregame.\n\n\"I'm at this Halloween party and she tells me, 'Don't talk to me until you're a success,\" Ramona said. \"I mean, all of us women on the show were very successful even before we did the show. Bethenny became successful because of the show.\"\n\nOuch! Can Ramona and Bethenny ever make up or has the rift gotten too big? The upcoming reunion promises to show how they feel after wrapping a tense season with each other. Make sure to tune in to Part 1 of the RHONY reunion, airing Wednesday, August 22, at a special time, 8/7c. Check out a preview of some more Ramona vs. Bethenny drama to come, below.
