Lively added a touch of femininity to the menswear look and paired the suit with pink Christian Louboutin bejeweled heels, Lorraine Schwartz jewels, and a hot pink lip.\n\nGotham Getty Images\n\nEstrop Getty Images\n\nLook #3: Plaids and checkers and a Gossip Girl throwback.\n\nOn day two, the former Upper East Sider journeyed back to her Gossip Girl prep school roots and stunned in a very busy plaid/checkered Roland Mouret suit and tie, and accessorized with an embellished cream clutch.\n\nJames Devaney Getty Images\n\nLook #4: More is more is more.\n\nThis purple and green snake print Bottega Venetta shorts suit and Stuart Weitzman heels is a lotta look.\n\nSplash News\n\nLook #5: A pinstriped grand finale.\n\nLively wore a cream and black pinstripe three-piece suit from Zimmerman Resort 2019 for her last stop on this pantsuit press tour. Underneath the sleeveless vest, Lively wore a sheer lace collared shirt and nude heels.\n\nJames Devaney Getty Images\n\nJames Devaney Getty Images\n\nLook #6: Pretty in (dusty) pink.\n\nAfter a weekend of bold colors and prints, Lively opted for a more muted tone and reached for a dusty pink linen pantsuit from Vivienne Westwood. The actress layered the frayed trim jacket over a classic Sonia Rykiel white blouse and paired the outfit with white and brown oxford loafers.\n\nSplash\n\nWith just a few weeks until the thriller officially debuts in theaters, it's likely B has a lot more enviable looks up her (menswear-inspired) sleeve.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elle-blake-lively-suit-comp-1534781165.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-862054118-blake-lively-1525279203.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elle-blake-lively-suit-comp-1534781165.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nerisha Penrose", "Assistant Editor", "Nerisha Is The Assistant Editor At Elle.Com", "Covering All Things Beauty"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a22773638/blake-lively-suits-pantsuit-roland-mouret-versace-a-simple-favor-press-tour/", "title": "Blake Lively Sure Is Wearing a Lot of Lively Suits", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Blake Lively Sure Is Wearing a Lot of Lively Suits", "description": "Call her the new pantsuit connoisseur.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a22773638/blake-lively-suits-pantsuit-roland-mouret-versace-a-simple-favor-press-tour/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elle-blake-lively-suit-comp-1534781165.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-08-22 07:28:59", "published_time": "2018-08-20 05:32:00", "section": "Celebrity Style 2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elle-blake-lively-suit-comp-1534781165.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Just Call Blake Lively the New Pantsuit Connoisseur", "description": "Blake Lively has been wearing a lot of suits on her current 'A Simple Favor' press tour.", "keywords": "Blake Lively style, A Simple Favor, press tour wardrobe, Anna Kendrick", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elle-blake-lively-suit-comp-1534781165.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Fashion,fashion,celebrity-style", "sailthru.date": "2018-08-20T17:32:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elle-blake-lively-suit-comp-1534781165.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elle-blake-lively-suit-comp-1534781165.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Blake Lively Sure Is Wearing a Lot of Lively Suits", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534757520.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
