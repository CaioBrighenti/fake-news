They really love your work on the show. But the director wants you to come into his office in a bikini. There\u2019s no audition. That\u2019s all you have to do,\u201d Rossum said during a comedy roundtable hosted by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe worst part \u2014 and likely the part every woman can relate to \u2014 was that Rossum didn\u2019t immediately dismiss the offer, because of such an ingrained culture of sexism whereby attitudes and expectations are actually just pretty normal occurrences. Relate?\n\n\u201cAnd I actually had this moment like, \u2018Well, how good is the part?\u2019\u201d Rossum said. \u201cFor a second, I was like, \u2018Would I do it? Send me the script. Maybe the character is in a bikini in the movie.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut upon getting her hands on the script, Rossum was horrified to know that nope, there was no bikini scene, and actually no nudity at all.\n\n\u201cWe really love your work, but we just want to see how tight your ass is,\u201d Rossum said, mimicking the director\u2019s voice. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? Last time I checked, I\u2019m not a fucking model.\u201d\n\nYeah, last time we checked a good bum might be a prerequisite for the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show but definitely not for much else.", "images": ["https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/billie_cover1_web-3.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red.svg", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-mobile-e28093-640-png-1.png", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-desktop-1000x56-png-1.png", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a08a8064a8de23a7a38411a6a58c7281", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4cb19af7030563658c68afbf0253f44e", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-rh-column-300x300-png-1.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/302450d0341256e000a18aa243887144", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/nav-close.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5792c482bfc7bc64f93d4257c07ca731", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2953d27c2f54cc587cfdd5c73c34928d", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5c96f9faf98d79384912137fe44a36d7", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/vogue-au-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f04f0147a6c8e2cae1d6f2074a3c1dde", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ed9adf26c820942e209c64dc52527293", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4fd84626e47083be864185a7cb31ba22", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red-mobile.svg", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/google-play.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/8a3fb4cacf0ec017d9aac850fb3e8bee", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chp_export_165464712_riverdale-for-watch-on-demand-coloumn.jpg", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/7de719e1f7c167e0f5270c193c9b942c", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80bf4d4f4840daab4f18df57aa7ee0a5", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/app-store.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f7aef56bf5aa3e4d4f8138e45413757c", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/34fdb4c32b9d37b0a75e4a88d05ac2e7", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/517a8ce281d51ac58380eea61342b168", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/18a975026a37422fafc9b545640c9ef3"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/34fdb4c32b9d37b0a75e4a88d05ac2e7", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Francesca Wallace"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com.au/celebrity/news/emmy-rossum-was-asked-to-audition-in-a-bikini-for-movie-with-no-bikini-scene/news-story/960db71c92b08c714a6b69a07d219bb5", "title": "Emmy Rossum was asked to audition in a bikini for movie with no bikini scene", "meta_data": {"author": "Francesca Wallace", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue Australia", "type": "article", "title": "Emmy Rossum was asked to audition in a bikini for movie with no bikini scene", "description": "Not okay.", "url": "https://www.vogue.com.au/celebrity/news/emmy-rossum-was-asked-to-audition-in-a-bikini-for-movie-with-no-bikini-scene/news-story/960db71c92b08c714a6b69a07d219bb5", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=200", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"creator": {"identifier": "vogueaustralia", "id": "vogueaustralia_id"}, "title": "Emmy Rossum was asked to audition in a bikini for movie with no bikini scene", "description": "Not okay.", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=240", "src": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/34fdb4c32b9d37b0a75e4a88d05ac2e7"}, "site": "@wordpressdotcom", "text": {"title": "Emmy Rossum was asked to audition in a bikini for movie with no bikini\u00a0scene"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=270", "theme-color": "#000000", "google-site-verification": "1j07G6Nu2IDJrC-g23wwzTEjb-d0Va1h15olpbRuxYI", "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-16T14:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-17T01:13:00+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "application-name": "Vogue Australia", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Vogue -
