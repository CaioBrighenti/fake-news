{"url": "https://people.com/tv/alyssa-milano-insatiable-fat-shaming/", "text": "Netflix\u2019s newest dark comedy, Insatiable, is being accused of fat-shaming \u2014 but star Alyssa Milano insists the show is actually tackling the topic head-on.\n\nThe series follows former Disney darling Debby Ryan as a high school student named Patty who was bullied relentlessly about her weight. After an incident leads to her jaw being wired shut over the summer, Patty shows up for the first day of her senior year looking rather different \u2014 and thirsty for revenge against anyone who was mean to her.\n\nAfter the new trailer was released on Thursday, the show faced significant backlash, with critics accusing the show of fat-shaming and calling it \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201clazy\u201d and \u201ctoxic.\u201d\n\nMilano, who plays the wife of Patty\u2019s lawyer, tweeted that the show hopes to confront the issue of bullying, not create more of it.\n\n\u201cWe are not shaming Patty,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe are addressing (through comedy) the damage that occurs from fat shaming. I hope that clears it up.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Eliza Morse/Netflix\n\nWe are not shaming Patty. We are addressing (through comedy) the damage that occurs from fat shaming. I hope that clears it up. Also, this article does a good job of explaining it more: https://t.co/WoR8R7TjqR #Insatiable https://t.co/GFkDdsn1uh \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) July 19, 2018\n\nShe then refers to an article in Teen Vogue about the show.\n\nRyan hasn\u2019t addressed the backlash directly, but she too pointed her Twitter followers to the Teen Vogue article and posted a screenshot of a highlighted section that reads: \u201cWhen she returns to school, everyone\u2019s stunned by her physical change. Problematic? You bet. After all, if someone\u2019s treatment of you is rooted in how your body looks, that says a lot about them, not you. Attuned to that, Patty sets out on a quest to make everyone pay for how they treated her (even if you really should just let karma deal with the wrongdoers in its good, sweet time).\u201d\n\nImage zoom Tina Rowden/Netflix\n\nThe show\u2019s writer and executive producer, Lauren Gussis, describes Patty as inspired by her own \u201cformerly bullied teenager.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really felt like it was important to look at [bullying] head on and talk about it,\u201d Gussis tells Teen Vogue. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that if I\u2019m gonna lay out all of my pain for humor, that I\u2019m gonna make at least one person feel less alone. Hopefully a lot of people through the laughter will be like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m laughing because I relate. I\u2019m not laughing at, I\u2019m laughing with.'\u201d\n\nInsatiable premieres on Netflix on Aug. 10.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/alexandra-medina.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bridget-malcolm.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tori-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/hilary-duff-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1360px%2C714px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hannah-polites-3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/denise1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screen-shot-2019-07-01-at-3.36.17-pm.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kaley-cuoco-cupping.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kim-k-shapewear-line.jpg?crop=5px%2C382px%2C2147px%2C1127px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screen-shot-2019-07-10-at-12.51.23-pm.jpg?crop=0px%2C836px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mindy-kaling.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jessicasimpson-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1329px%2C697.725px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/kourtney2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/keyto-4.jpg?crop=0px%2C127px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/selma.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ins_107_unit_02297r.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ins_104_unit_00079r.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/culpo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1129px%2C592.725px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/denise2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/seyfried-charnas.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ins_104_unit_00079r.jpg?crop=0px%2C84px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/20190627_ww_maui_ow_lunch-809.jpg?crop=0px%2C279px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/anytime-fitness.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ins_104_unit_00079r.jpg?crop=0px%2C84px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Breanne L.
