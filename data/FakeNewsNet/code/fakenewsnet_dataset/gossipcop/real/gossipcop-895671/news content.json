Then, hours before King\u2019s appearance, her \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-anchor Charlie Rose was fired after an extensive Washington Post report detailed his alleged unwanted sexual advances toward women.\n\nClearly, the \u201cLate Show\u201d conversation had to take a much different turn \u2014 as a result, King admitted she wanted to bail.\n\n\u201cStephen, I came this close to canceling,\u201d King said at the top of the interview on Tuesday night.\n\n[CBS and PBS drop Charlie Rose following allegations of unwanted sexual advances]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Colbert assured her, and recapped what transpired over the last 24 hours: After Rose was accused by eight different women of sexual harassment in a Post story that published Monday, CBS fired him and PBS dropped his \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d talk show. Colbert noted that King and her other \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d co-anchor, Norah O\u2019Donnell, had to cover the story on-air Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been easy,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nKing agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s still very hurtful. Charlie and I, we\u2019ve worked together, been friends. But when you think about the anguish of those women, despite the friendship, you still have to report the news,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to cancel, because I didn\u2019t want to be sitting here talking about this. But when you think about the job we do at CBS, and how hard the people work \u2026 we are a top-notch broadcast operation. And that\u2019s why I thought it was important to be here.\u201d\n\nStill, King wasn\u2019t a fan of Colbert\u2019s Rose jokes in his monologue. Earlier, Colbert had read an excerpt from the Post story that alleged Rose once invited a woman to his house and suggested they watch a DVD of his show. \u201cWhat woman alive doesn\u2019t get aroused by an hour-long interview with Thomas Friedman?\u201d Colbert cracked. Colbert also played a fake theme song for Charlie Rose\u2019s show: \u201cHere comes Charlie, oh no!/He\u2019s gettin\u2019 naked, open robe, he\u2019s a creep!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was wincing at your monologue, though, Stephen,\u201d King told him.\n\n\u201cWell, you did your job this morning, I did my job tonight,\u201d Colbert said.\n\n\u201cI thought about that, too,\u201d King said, adding that she laughed when Colbert made fun of others in his monologue. \u201cThen it was Charlie and I thought \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a friend \u2014 I don\u2019t like that.\u2019 That\u2019s difficult. And then I think about what these women were going through. I don\u2019t like that either.\u201d\n\nThe two discussed how the shocking day had unfolded, which included raw and emotional on-air statements from King and O\u2019Donnell. King, who said she\u2019s feeling a mix of anger, sadness, compassion and concern, revealed there was a company meeting Tuesday afternoon where everyone gathered in the conference room to process the day\u2019s events.\n\n[\u2018I am not okay\u2019: The remarkable response to the Charlie Rose allegations, from his CBS colleagues]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of reeling about what has happened. It\u2019s a stunning thing what happened in 24 hours. Monday, your world is one way, and in 24 hours, Charlie has been suspended and then he has been fired. Charlie Rose, who was an icon in this country,\u201d King said. \u201cI\u2019m still wrapping my brain around that.\u201d\n\nOf course, King said, she\u2019s also thinking about the women who told their stories. \u201cI applaud them for speaking up. If anything changes in this, what I do hope is that people will speak up and that companies are sending a message that, \u2018We have zero tolerance for this kind of behavior.\u2019 And that is a very important thing,\u201d she said.\n\nBefore they eventually segued into much lighter topics \u2014 such as Oprah\u2019s favorite things \u2014 Colbert asked whether King thinks the Harvey Weinstein revelations have sparked a permanent change in people\u2019s willingness to talk about sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cWomen are no longer afraid to speak up. But the best part about it is they are now being believed. They are now being believed. That\u2019s big,\u201d King said. \u201cBut it has to be more than just a bunch of women talking about this issue. We really do need men to join this conversation. Nothing is going to change until men join the conversation, too, and more women are in places of power. That, also, is something that I think will change.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D3aHWarO_zLqeLrqkgyBsSSflq4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B76ZNHLZDU72VMFAG2RGWGJ65E.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D3aHWarO_zLqeLrqkgyBsSSflq4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B76ZNHLZDU72VMFAG2RGWGJ65E.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture", "November", "Emily Yahr Is An Entertainment Reporter For The Washington Post.
