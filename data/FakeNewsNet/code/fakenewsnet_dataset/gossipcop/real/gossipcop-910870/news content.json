But also, someone in our office said that someone from her, like, representative called and pitched her and he was pretty sure they thought it was a reality show. And I thought, well, \u2018How is that possible?\u2019\n\nShe continued, \u201cIf they think it\u2019s a reality show, why am I wearing a red wig and calling myself Valerie Cherish? And why would I be on a reality show called \u2018The Comeback?\u2019 That\u2019s the whole humiliating joke. Why would I do that?\u201d\n\nThe series featured a red-headed Kudrow as a has-been sitcom star vying for another shot at fame. And while a third season has yet to be confirmed, there have been discussions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking anyway, talking about what that would look like,\u201d Kudrow told E! News in 2015.\n\nThe first 13-episode season of \u201cThe Comeback\u201d ran from June to September 2005. An additional eight episodes aired nine years later in late 2014.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/lindsay-lohan-valerie-cherish.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/d29ea10c24a74df597d0ccaa32076ecd/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/lindsay-lohan-valerie-cherish.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["February"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/02/01/lisa-kudrow-lohans-team-thought-the-comeback-was-a-reality-show/", "title": "Lisa Kudrow: Lohan\u2019s team thought \u2018The Comeback\u2019 was a reality show", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2019 NYP Holdings.
