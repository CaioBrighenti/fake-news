Otherwise, it would have become a political event and not an opportunity to pay homage to the artists.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time in more than 20 years that a president has missed the annual celebration of artistic excellence. In August, the White House said that the presidential couple would decline the invitation so that the honorees could celebrate \u201cwithout any political distraction.\u201d\n\nEstefan did not spend any more time talking about Trump. Instead, she is looking ahead to January when her musical \u201cOn Your Feet,\u201d about her career beginnings with husband Emilio Estefan, \u201cwhich is already being presented in the Netherlands,\u201d will begin a run in Washington, D.C. And in 2018 she will record an album of Brazilian music.\n\n\u201cChristmas will be spent in Miami,\u201d she concluded.\n\nThe ceremony will air on Tuesday, Dec. 26 on CBS, at 9 p.m.\n\nFollow Arturo Arias-Polo on Twitter: @arturoariaspolo", "images": ["https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/jdi6gq/picture225684400/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/LeAnn-Rimes5.jpg", "https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=80380&contextPath=3179-80380&pubId=7&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=225777290&type=article&title=Trump+was+a+no-show%2C+but+Gloria+Estefan+still+got+her+Kennedy+Center+Honors&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.miamiherald.com%2Fmiami-com%2Fmiami-com-news%2Farticle225777290.html", "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/sfh3h6/picture225679815/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Lil-Wayne-Serious.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/yamq8z/picture225777280/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Gloria%20Estefan", "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/tqgoxw/picture224356075/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/esty", "https://www.miami.com/wps/build/images/miamiherald/logo.svg", "https://www.miamiherald.com/entertainment/celebrities/4sfbzw/picture133346639/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/olivia", "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/x67xai/picture232585747/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/HELSINKI%20SHOW%201%202018%20IM%20-58061.jpg", "https://www.kentucky.com/latest-news/1x2qx2/picture231786423/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/AP_19148742892525.jpg", "https://www.miami.com/wps/build/images/miamiherald-miami-com/logo.svg", "https://www.elnuevoherald.com/ultimas-noticias/i2lh5m/picture218095305/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/IMG_Serena_2_1_BDEDJC4T_L416136519.JPG", "https://www.miami.com/wps/build/images/miamiherald/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png"], "top_img": "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/yamq8z/picture225777280/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Gloria%20Estefan", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Greg Allen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/news/article225777290.html", "title": "Gloria Estefan is first Cuban-American to receive Kennedy Center Honors", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/miamiherald/windowsmetro-144.png", "robots": "nofollow", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "miamiherald", "title": "Trump was a no-show, but Gloria Estefan still got her Kennedy Center Honors", "description": "Gloria Estefan received the top cultural honor this weekend at the Kennedy Center Honors with Lionel Richie, LL Cool J, Norman Lear and Carmen de Lavallade.", "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/yamq8z/picture225777280/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Gloria%20Estefan"}, "og": {"site_name": "miamiherald", "type": "article", "title": "Trump was a no-show, but Gloria Estefan still got her Kennedy Center Honors", "url": "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/article225777290.html", "description": "Gloria Estefan received the top cultural honor this weekend at the Kennedy Center Honors with Lionel Richie, LL Cool J, Norman Lear and Carmen de Lavallade.", "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/miami-com-news/yamq8z/picture225777280/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Gloria%20Estefan"}, "fb": {"app_id": 133847067760, "pages": 15440589699}, "title": "Gloria Estefan is first Cuban-American to receive Kennedy Center Honors | Miami.com | Miami Herald", "allow-comments": "true", "description": "Gloria Estefan received the top cultural honor this weekend at the Kennedy Center Honors with Lionel Richie, LL Cool J, Norman Lear and Carmen de Lavallade.", "keywords": "Gloria Estefan, Kennedy Center Honors, Lionel Richie, LL Cool J, president donald trump, kennedy center", "news_keywords": "Gloria Estefan, Kennedy Center Honors, Lionel Richie, LL Cool J, president donald trump, kennedy center", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "original-source": "https://www.miamiherald.com/miami-com/news/article225777290.html", "google-site-verification": "CGBP3Njv1HyxLF1VInLHOprjcfJXffMVe5Udr0HQf-U", "parsely-metadata": "{\"article_id\": \"225777290\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.miami.com", "summary": ""}
