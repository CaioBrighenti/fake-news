Luckily \u201cThe Late Late Show with James Corden\u201d has you covered to the tune of the song of the summer.\n\nThe late night host, who expresses his love of song in any way he can, performed a cover of \u201cDespacito,\u201d the track by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber (on the remix anyway) that tied for the longest-leading Billboard Hot 100 number one of 2017 and has the most watched video on YouTube.\n\nThe song starts off recapping a lot of the politics news that happened in just the past couple of weeks, including \u201cNorth Korean threats of aggression\u201d and President Donald Trump\u2019s comments on the violence in Charlottesville over the weekend, in which he said that \u201cboth sides were to blame,\u201d according to the tune.\n\nAlso Read: Confessions of a Late-Night Writer: No, I Don't Love Making Donald Trump Jokes\n\n\u201cDonald Trump made comments that brought him shame/ Kept saying that both sides are to blame/ After denouncing the neo-Nazis slowly, slowly,\u201d the host sang. \u201cPlus, he hired Anthony Scarmooch/ who thought Reince Priebus was a total douche/ But that never paid off and Spicer got laid off/ No one in that White House gonna last long.\u201d\n\nHowever, other stuff happened this summer too. In case you forgot, Beyonce gave birth to twins, \u201cWonder Woman\u201d was a hit at the box office and \u201cDunkirk\u201d was a movie that starred, among many other actors, Harry Styles of One Direction fame.\n\nSo a lot happened this summer. Let\u2019s hope that next summer, things happen more slowly.\n\nWatch the full performance above.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spider-man-far-from-home-DF-06693_r.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fast-and-furious-every-car-ranked-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CMS_EW_061919_Comedy618x742-1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2F5A0156.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/envelope.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-108340929-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DogTheBountyHunter-1-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/James-Corden-John-Boyega-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070919_Whitman_Quibi_1092px.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-05-at-11.28.05-AM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CarpoolKaraokeWill-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChloeDan-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/james-corden-despacito.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1153289783-1-e1562700127279.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-5.59.05-PM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/TRUMP-1-160x105.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/james-corden-despacito.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carli Velocci", "Brian Flood", "Ashley Boucher", "Tony Maglio", "Beatrice Verhoeven", "Ross A.
