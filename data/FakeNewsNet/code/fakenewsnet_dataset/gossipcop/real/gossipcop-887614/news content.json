That was kind of an offhand thing, and then the press really ran with it,\u201d Thompson told Observer. \u201cThe extent to which the press ran with it is also an expression of what ripe a time it is for something like that. That people are hungry for it, that people are interested in it.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, Marvel does seem to be making more of an effort on that front when you look at the studio\u2019s upcoming release schedule.\n\n\u201cI think, regardless, Marvel is making their Black Widow movie and they are doing Captain Marvel and the female characters in the big team-up movies tend to be, at least for me, some of the strongest elements,\u201d she said.\n\nStill, we would have loved to see all of those badass heroines duking it out on-screen.\n\nWhile Thompson didn\u2019t rule out the possibility entirely, fans will need to look forward to Marvel\u2019s exciting upcoming features in the meantime, as it doesn\u2019t sound as if the all-female team-up is a high priority at the moment.\n\nLarson\u2019s Captain Marvel will be the first female-led blockbuster from Marvel following the massive success of rival Warner Bros.\u2019 Wonder Woman. The character is expected to make her debut in a brief appearance in Avengers: Infinity War and her 2019 solo adventure, the only MCU flick in-between Infinity War and Avengers 4, will take place in the 1990s and will likely set up the final film with this current roster of Avengers.\n\nVariety reported back in February that Marvel had hired screenwriter Jac Schaeffer to pen a script for a Black Widow solo film. Fans have been clamoring for Johansson\u2019s character to receive her own spinoff for years, but the previous Marvel regime was reluctant to give the project a greenlight.\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to hold out hope for Thompson\u2019s vision (no pun intended) to become a reality.", "images": ["https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/thor-ragnarok_ki_v3.jpg?quality=80&w=635", "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/thor-ragnarok_ki_v3.jpg?quality=80&w=970&strip", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/observer-logo-2015.png", "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/thor-ragnarok_ki_v3.jpg?quality=80&w=1200&strip", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/thor-ragnarok_ki_v3.jpg?quality=80&w=1200&strip", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Katz", "Brandon Katz Is A Pop Culture Junkie", "An Entertainment News Reporter Covering Film", "Television", "Music.
