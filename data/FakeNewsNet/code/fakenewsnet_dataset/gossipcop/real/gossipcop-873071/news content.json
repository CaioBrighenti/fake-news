Aside from illuminating spaces, pendant lights add instant chic to indoor spaces and add to a cohesive look. Modern pendants offer unmatched diversity ranging from understated single pendant versions as well as multi-light pendants. Regardless of your d\u00e9cor style, you can find a contemporary pendant that suits your space \u2013 from whimsical and fun styles to those with clean lines.\n\nWhat are the Different Types of Pendant Lighting?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing your ceiling lighting, you have a multitude of options. Pendant lighting is suitable for more than just dining areas. These adaptable fixtures shine in a variety of settings and can serve as the finishing touch to a well-appointed space.

Large hanging lamps or multi-light fixtures are best suited to indoor spaces like dining rooms and kitchen pendant lights provide bright task lighting where you need it most. Single pendants also look great when grouped together and suspended at various heights for a bold statement. When hanging a pendant over a table, the ideal drop is between 28 and 32 inches, but you can experiment with different heights to find the look to complete your space.\n\nAnother consideration is what type of lighting you need in your space. If you are hanging your pendant in a dining area, choose a fixture that emits ambient, or soft light. If you intend to use your pendant in an office, then task lighting is a better option. Choosing a compatible bulb for your fixture will help you achieve the desired illumination.\n\nIconic Pendant Light Designs\n\nModern pendant lighting has evolved over the years to become more refined while incorporating remarkable contemporary elements like cracked glass shades, highly-reflective specialty shades, and irregularly shaped shades that support modern d\u00e9cor.

So how do you choose the best pendant for your space? You can start by taking stock of the space where you want to install the pendant. Understanding the tone of the room gives you a great place to make your selection.\n\nWhat's the purpose of my new pendant light? In certain rooms, a light fixture serves a more functional purpose rather than fashionable. For instance, the pendants you choose to hang over your kitchen island will provide functional, task-oriented illumination while the lighting at the front door is meant to captivate guests entering your home.\n\nHow do I choose the right size pendant light? Begin by knowing the square footage of the room you plan to add this type of lighting in. You'll need to consider the ceiling height (including vaulted and sloped ceilings) to help you make the best choice.

Look for pendant lights that will complement your existing color palette. From vibrant reds and blues to conservative greyscale designs, this assortment has it all. Consider the finishes of hardware on the light fixture as well. While many metallic finishes are popular, your rooms may be better suited by wood accents.\n\nHow much light will a pendant provide? The light source of the pendant is another important consideration. LED pendants will emit a different amount of light compared to those using halogen or incandescent light sources. You'll also want to be mindful of the brightness the fixture produces. Be sure to take a look at our guide on interpreting lumens too.\n\nHow do I install pendant lights? Other things to consider when choosing a pendant for your home include the ease of installation and its maintenance.
