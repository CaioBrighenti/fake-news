I love Deadpool. I can't wait to see the movie. You're one of my best friends. Blake, the fam, the whole thing. But back it up a little. Play a little hard to get. It's too much; it's not sexy.\n\nRELATED: Infinity War Directors Have the Perfect Response to Deadpool 2's Spoiler Letter\n\nJackman sort of made a cameo in 2016\u2019s Deadpool, in which Reynolds\u2019 Wade Wilson wears a cutout of his People\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d cover, and rumors persisted that the Merc With a Mouth might appear last year in a post-credits scene for Logan. However, those were shot down \u2014 and the James Mangold film didn\u2019t even have a post-credits sequence. The closest we got was the Deadpool teaser that played in theaters with Logan.\n\nThe two starred together in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine. However, Reynolds has long pushed for a team-up movie with Jackman and to have him appear in Deadpool 2. Although the two recently shared some screen time to record a birthday message, there's no indication they'll team-up again any time soon, especially since Jackman retired from the role.\n\nRELATED: Is This Deadpool 2's Super-Secret Cameo?\n\nDirected by David Leitch, Deadpool 2 features Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 as the voice of Colossus, and Karan Soni as Dopinder, with newcomers Zazie Beetz as Domino, Josh Brolin as Cable and Julian Dennison as Russell. The film opens May 18.\n\nScooby Doo: First Scoob Key Art Leaks Online", "images": ["https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-deadpool.jpg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/th-logo-full-white.7684e614.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/sr-logo-full-white.b0cc2b44.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-white.642d3d01.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/hc-logo-full-white.5f66cfe4.svg", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/91f52889f6a04390a65ad2591c59986e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tq-logo-full-white.7436bde3.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-white.04a6f0d4.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/ts-logo-full-white.54beb4cf.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tg-logo-full-white.fc9e742a.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/cb-logo-full-white.afca2e29.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-white.fe72c74c.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-white.8242bbb9.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tr-logo-full-white.090c581a.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1639279299697145&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-deadpool.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Stone", "Brandon Staley", "Narayan Liu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbr.com/hugh-jackman-tells-ryan-reynolds-play-hard-to-get/", "title": "Hugh Jackman Has a Message For Ryan Reynolds: 'Play a Little Hard to Get'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Hugh Jackman responds to Ryan Reynolds's attempts to have Wolverine and Deadpool team-up, saying, 'play a little hard to get.'", "og": {"title": "Hugh Jackman Has a Message For Ryan Reynolds: 'Play a Little Hard to Get'", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-deadpool.jpg", "width": 1476, "height": 777}, "url": "https://www.cbr.com/hugh-jackman-tells-ryan-reynolds-play-hard-to-get/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Hugh Jackman responds to Ryan Reynolds's attempts to have Wolverine and Deadpool team-up, saying, \"play a little hard to get.\"", "site_name": "CBR"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-10T17:05:11Z", "section": "Movies"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1754119328184357, "pages": 10765693196}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/BTZ3a3LSJAQ?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1525971911.0, "source": "https://www.cbr.com", "summary": ""}
