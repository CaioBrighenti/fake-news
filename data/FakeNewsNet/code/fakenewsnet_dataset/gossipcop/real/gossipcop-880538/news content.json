(The 2017 iteration takes place in Lewiston, Maine, from Oct. 7-8.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re closing in on 10 years soon,\u201d Dempsey says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special experience I think for everyone who participates. Some people are doing it because they themselves have been diagnosed or a family member, they\u2019ve lost someone. There\u2019s an atmosphere and a feeling that is hard to put into words, where everyone is pulling together. There\u2019s an openness, there\u2019s a loving community, and we\u2019re all rolling along on bikes. We have these wonderful moments with people that are very special, and I think so many people have been touched by cancer and how it affects them. It\u2019s such a devastating disease.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Patrick Dempsey on Life After Grey\u2019s Anatomy\n\n\u201cWhen we set out to start this, we had no idea that it would be as successful as it is,\u201d he adds, \u201cand that allows us to make sure that all of our services are free to the people who come through the door and we can give them the best quality of life and empower them and make them feel strong in whatever way we can.\u201d\n\nDempsey is also returning to the small screen in EPIX\u2019s 10-episode adaptation of Jo\u00ebl Dicker\u2019s The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair.\n\nTwo months into shooting, he\u2019s acting out of his rom-com leading man comfort zone \u2014 and couldn\u2019t be more thrilled, calling the set \u201csublime.\u201d\n\n\u201cJean-Jacques Annaud is just one of the best directors I\u2019ve ever worked with in my life, and the experience has been challenging and enjoyable,\u201d Dempsey says. \u201cThe cast is extraordinary, and it\u2019s a different character. It\u2019s a much darker piece. It\u2019s very much a romantic thriller, and it\u2019s an opportunity to do something a little bit darker, a little bit edgier, and at the same time have romantic qualities to it that I think people that enjoyed Grey\u2019s will hopefully enjoy. But it certainly will challenge the audience.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/alexandra-medina.jpg",
