Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter.\n\n\u201cNick is incredible,\u201d Vanessa says. \u201cNick is the reason that we are, I think, sane. He is our foundation. He is our rock. He keeps it together because Lord knows I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAlthough spending time with their kids is top priority, the couple, who tied the knot in 2011, still makes sure to \u201ccarve out time\u201d for themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy, especially with multiple kids, to just get caught up in that \u2014 and it\u2019s a beautiful thing to get caught up in,\u201d says Nick. \u201cBut it\u2019s also good to have a balance where you\u2019re still seeing your friends, you\u2019re still having date night, you\u2019re still doing things that are important to you outside of your family.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Fabio Chizzola\n\nHowever, when it comes to making plans without their children, they need to know \u201cat least a week in advance,\u201d says Vanessa.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no spontaneous date nights,\u201d she shares. \u201cWe have to make a full plan [and] make sure there\u2019s nothing with the [kids\u2019] schedules.\u201d\n\n\n\nMost of the time, the family of five is together. \u201cWe spend a lot of time together as a family,\u201d says Nick. \u201cI think at this age it\u2019s a lot of going to the park. It\u2019s a lot of going to get ice cream or just fun stuff at their age they can do.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to the couple\u2019s parenting style, Nick describes it as \u201cmoderate.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we turn away and say, \u2018Hey! Let the kids do whatever they want,\u2019 \u201d he says, \u201cbut we also don\u2019t want to be helicopter parents where we\u2019re constantly berating and berating, and after a while I think it just falls on deaf ears.\u201d\n\nAdds Vanessa, \u201cI believe things that are important to us, we\u2019re strict about. For example, manners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe always make sure you have to clean up after yourself,\u201d she explains. \u201d \u2018You have to say please. You have to say thank you. Look someone in the eye when you talk to them. Make sure that you keep your hands to yourself. Don\u2019t do that to your sister,\u2019 and that is a constant \u2014 and I say it\u2019s exhausting because it\u2019s a constant lesson.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cBut when you see moments of it paying off and [Camden] walking and going, \u2018Excuse me? May I have an ice-cream cone, please?\u2019 and he looks at him in the eye, and says, \u2018Thank you,\u2019 you\u2019re like, \u2018They do listen!\u2019 \u201c\n\nEven though it\u2019s always a team effort between the pair, Nick admits, \u201cIf it gets bad\u201d he\u2019s \u201cthe bad cop for sure.\u201d\n\nExplains Vanessa, \u201cI think it\u2019s because \u2014 and I told Nick this \u2014 they love and respect him so much that they don\u2019t want to disappoint him. And when Nick is upset, you can see it in his face, and he\u2019s not okay. Literally, he can look at them and they\u2019ll get the quiver lip.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the dad look,\u201d says Nick, adding that as far as disciplining their children equally, Vanessa thinks he\u2019s \u201ca complete pushover\u201d with Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true,\u201d he insists. \u201cI handle it in different ways, but I discipline her.\u201d\n\nWatch the full episode of World\u2019s Most Beautiful: My Beautiful Family now on the new People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). Go to PEOPLE.com/PEN or download the PEN app on your favorite device.\n\nFor Vanessa, the \u201ctrue test\u201d will be how Nick is with Phoenix.\n\n\u201c[He does] let a lot go with [Brooklyn],\u201d she says, \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018That would\u2019ve never flown with Camden.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAs for their best and worst qualities as parents? \u201cVanessa\u2019s best quality as a parent is her absolute across-the-board, unwavering love for her kids, and she never lets a moment go by where her kids don\u2019t know how much she loves them,\u201d says Nick, adding, \u201cThat love, sometimes, allows her to spoil the heck out of the kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cCamden\u2019s car collection rivals Jay Leno\u2018s,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut I guess that\u2019s not really a bad flaw.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Hearing Nick Lachey Gush About His Kids Will Warm Your Heart\n\nFor Nick, his best and worst quality is his \u201csensitivity,\u201d says Vanessa.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so sensitive to the kids that he\u2019s an amazing dad because he\u2019s very aware of how they\u2019re feeling and what\u2019s going on with them,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe\u2019s so in tune with them that it\u2019s a beautiful thing to watch, and watch his parenting with that sensitivity.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then to a fault, he worries so much,\u201d she continues. \u201d \u2018Did you see that?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Babe! He\u2019s 4.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Man. I don\u2019t know.\u2019 \u201c\n\nEven Nick, himself, admits he\u2019s \u201cbanned from WebMD.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to go on WebMD anymore,\u201d he says, adding that he\u2019s not a hypochondriac and that he just tends to \u201clook up symptoms.\u201d\n\nBut the couple shares that, over the years, they\u2019ve grown as parents.\n\n\u201cI think by the time [you have] your first one, everything is so surreal and you\u2019re so precious and paranoid about everything as first-time parents,\u201d explains Nick. \u201cAnd then by the second one, you\u2019ve been down that road once, so you\u2019re a little bit more prepared for what\u2019s going to come, so you\u2019re a little bit more relaxed. And then by the third, I think you let down your guard even a little bit more, but it\u2019s all in a positive way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to tell women it\u2019s like a quiet confident,\u201d adds Vanessa. \u201cIt\u2019s just a calm feeling that overtakes you.\u201d\n\nStill, all three of their kids are \u201cvery different,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThey test you,\u201d Vanessa admits. \u201cNo matter what you think you know with one, you get all new challenges with the next. You get all new challenges with the third \u2026 it\u2019s just something new every time.\u201d\n\nHowever, the parents of three may not find out what it\u2019s like to add another baby to their family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very happy with our three,\u201d shares Vanessa. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re like, \u2018No!\u2019 It\u2019s just we love the dynamic we have.\u201d\n\nShe explains, \u201cWe had the boy and the girl, and three was the wild card \u2014 whenever it happened, it was going to happen, and it happened sooner than I think we thought.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nFor the couple, Phoenix\u2019s arrival was \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201csuch a welcoming surprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cFive of us, three kids, is a good number,\u201d says Vanessa. \u201cAny more than that and we\u2019re really outnumbered.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cWe personally would have no time for ourselves and life in general, and it just becomes madness. People who do it, I commend them. I applaud them. We respect them, but we\u2019re good at three.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor more from the Lacheys and more celebrity families, pick up PEOPLE\u2019s World\u2019s Most Beautiful issue, on newsstands now.",
