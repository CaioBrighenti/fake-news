But away from the paparazzi-trailed coffee breaks and tabloid drama, Shookus is, without a doubt, a leading lady.\n\nLindsay started at Saturday Night Live at just 22, fresh off earning a degree in Journalism at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\n\nShe was mentored by famed SNL producer Marci Klein (yes, daughter to Calvin), and soon began making a name for herself on the show. In fact, Lindsay is credited with discovering one of the show\u2019s most prolific cast members of the modern era, Kristen Wiig.\n\n\u201cShe saw my tape\u2014I don\u2019t know if it was lost in the shuffle or what\u2014and she took it to the right people and was like, \u2018I really think we should audition this person,\u2019\u201d Wiig told Elle of being discovered by Shookus in 2005. \u201cAuditioning for SNL is a very nerve-racking experience, and Lindsay and I clicked. She kind of talked me down a little bit\u2014I was very nervous. She was with me through the whole process; I\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d\n\nProfessional talent aside, Kristen says the producer\u2019s dance skills are not to be ignored. \u201cLindsay is fun to get a drink with and is also one of the better dancers I know.\u201d High praise, indeed because:\n\nRELATED: Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus Wear Coordinating Button-Ups for Post-Thanksgiving Coffee Run\n\nWhen it comes to her relationship with Affleck, Shookus is still surprised by the notoriety. \"It\u2019s strange to me,\u201d she says of her newfound fame. \u201cMy entire career has been behind the camera, and that\u2019s definitely where I\u2019m most comfortable. I\u2019m a producer, I\u2019m a mom, a friend. Being considered a public figure honestly makes me laugh.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Getty Images\n\nCome what may, Shookus isn\u2019t about to let the publicity get to her head: \u201cSomeone thinks about you for one minute and then says, \u2018What do I want for lunch?\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/gettyimages-1156844004.jpg",
