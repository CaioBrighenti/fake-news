Add some crinkling to the corners of your eyes and it seems like you have a recipe for a makeup mess. According to Sir John, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s main beauty guru, that\u2019s not the case. He\u2019s currently on the run with Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z for their OTR II world tour, but he took time out to share his secrets for flawlessly recreating his signature feline flick at home. \u201cThis whole tour, I\u2019m doing a serious cat eye on her \u2014 it\u2019s almost like an optical illusion,\u201d he says of the eye-opening effects of the iconic look. Here, his top tips for winging it like a pro.\n\nStep 1: Create a smooth surface\n\nMaybe you\u2019re just thinking about making an appointment with your derm to discuss those undesirable laugh lines at the outer corners of your eyes created by repetitive muscle movement (i.e., smiling or squinting), or perhaps you\u2019ve already dabbled in medical aesthetics to help iron them out. But, according to Sir John, injectable wrinkle reducers (which temporarily smooth the appearance of wrinkles in areas like the crow\u2019s feet for adults) can create a more level playing field. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make your eyeliner application crisper and allow you to execute the trend a lot better,\u201d he explains.\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: Injectable wrinkle reducers are prescription treatments, so be sure to talk to a provider about the risks and benefits to see if they are right for you.]\n\nHe also suggests avoiding greasy eye creams before applying your cat eye, and for extra insurance, using a lid primer \u2014 he likes NARS Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base ($26). After all, once you\u2019ve achieved even wings (otherwise known as beauty nirvana), you want to make sure your hard work doesn\u2019t budge.\n\nStep 2: Find your light\n\n\u201cNine times out of ten, your bathroom is not going to have the best lighting,\u201d says Sir John, who recommends applying eyeliner in natural light (like near a sunny window). Once you\u2019re in a well-lit space, place a mirror on a hard surface and lean your head back slightly so that you\u2019re able to look up your nose. \u201c[This angle] gives you the best view of your eyelid so that you can create a beautiful, lateral line,\u201d he adds.\n\nStep 3: Take it slow and steady\n\nEven this master of makeup admitted that felt-tip eyeliner pens can be tricky, but said a skinny brush dipped in a gel formula \u2014 such as MAC Cosmetics Pro Longwear Fluidline in Blacktrack ($18) \u2014 offers more control. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get a perfect wing in one go,\u201d stresses Sir John. \u201cPace yourself \u2014 I like to do three or four strokes that overlap to create one continuous line.\u201d\n\nStart from the inner corner and work your way to the outer corner. Once you get there \u2014 and while the liner is still wet \u2014 gently drag the pigment out and up toward the tail end of your brow to make eyes appear more lifted. Then, trace over the shape you just created with liner again to intensify the line. (Don\u2019t worry about refining the flick just yet! You\u2019ll sharpen the edges in step seven.)\n\nIn terms of where the line should stop, there really are no rules, according to the pro. \u201cI like a more extended eye \u00e0 la Sophia Loren,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can be dramatic with winged liner and bring the shape out a bit farther to makes eyes look bigger and brighter.\u201d\n\nStep 4: Define your lower lashes\n\nTo \u2019Yonce-ify your cat eye, rim your lower lash line with a brown pencil for added definition \u2014 a trick Sir John often uses on the Queen herself. \u201cNo one knows they\u2019re looking at brown and not black, but it\u2019s so much less aggressive,\u201d he explains. The must-have pencils he keeps in his kit are from Marc Jacobs Beauty Highliner Gel Eye Crayon Eyeliner in (Earth)Quake 41 ($25) and MAC Cosmetics Technakohl liner in Brownborder ($18) because they\u2019re \u201cvery creamy but don\u2019t move once they dry.\u201d Just be sure to gently blend the band of color with a brush, cotton swab, or sponge before it sets, as \u201ca blunt line along the bottom lashes can age the eye,\u201d he warns.\n\nStep 5: Tighten the top\n\nA two-second trick that makes a \u201chuge difference\u201d is tightlining your top lashes, says Sir John, who always rims the inner waterline with a black pencil to make eyes look more dynamic. He likes MAC Cosmetics Technakohl Liner in Graphblack ($18). \u201cThe entire area between the liner and your lashes should be dense and saturated with color \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t see any skin,\u201d the pro notes.\n\nPolish off lashes with mascara, wiggling the wand back and forth at the roots and pulling up toward the tips. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you were brushing your teeth,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis creates separation and massive amounts of volume.\u201d\n\nStep 6: Perfect your shape\n\nThe final step is calling in the clean-up crew. \u201cWater-based makeup remover and Muji Thin Cotton Swabs ($3) are my best friends for getting the perfect shape,\u201d Sir John says. To do this, simply add a few drops of remover to the swab (don\u2019t oversaturate it, because this could cause you to remove more liner than you intended!), then use it just as you would an eraser to make the edges look super crisp. After sharpening his wings, Sir John uses a fluffy brush like the MAC Cosmetics 224 ($32) to apply concealer and get undereyes in formation. With flicks this fierce, you\u2019re ready to run the world.\n\nAllergan may receive commission for purchases made through links in this article.\n\nSir John is a paid Allergan consultant.", "images": ["https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560536140-stocksytxp9a66909em9n200large22977451x1.png?w=50&h=50&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560829349-thumbandfeaturestocksytxp2c1f8c6ablj200originaldelivery490489tszfrw.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=jpg&ixlib=react-8.5.1", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560830657-thumbandfeaturecatmattavnzz7f.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=jpg&ixlib=react-8.5.1", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560836822-istock-499778695jybslk.jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560535067-beauty-pros.png?w=50&h=50&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560531308-stocksytxpc229acccspm200large23177711x1.png?w=50&h=50&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560831028-thumbimg4865st0pt0.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=jpg&ixlib=react-8.5.1", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560832215-thumbandfeatureistock-466976408m6h7k2.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=jpg&ixlib=react-8.5.1", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560839650-istock-500924969.jpg?auto=format&w=500?trimcolor=fff&trim=color&fit=fillmax&fill=solid&fill-color=fff&w=530&h=400&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560531308-stocksytxpc229acccspm200large23177711x1.png?w=60&h=60&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560535067-beauty-pros.png?w=60&h=60&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560831086-thumbandfeature101918spotlyte24loft04601tsmrlu.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=jpg&ixlib=react-8.5.1", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560836864-istock-499778695jybslk.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=jpg&ixlib=react-8.5.1", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560536140-stocksytxp9a66909em9n200large22977451x1.png?w=60&h=60&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560839651-istock-530797977.jpg?auto=format&w=500?trimcolor=fff&trim=color&fit=fillmax&fill=solid&fill-color=fff&w=530&h=400&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560839650-istock-941128310.jpg?auto=format&w=500?trimcolor=fff&trim=color&fit=fillmax&fill=solid&fill-color=fff&w=530&h=400&fm=jpg", "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560831569-thumbandfeaturestocksytxpfe1dfcc588e200large1316814s8owdl.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=jpg&ixlib=react-8.5.1"], "top_img": "https://www.datocms-assets.com/8490/1560836822-istock-499778695jybslk.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Moleti", "May", "Cat Matta", "March", "Kristin Granero", "February", "January"], "canonical_link": "https://thespotlyte.com/1124774/how-to-diy-a-cat-eye-like-beyonces", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Go-To Makeup Artist Explains How to Get Your Cat Eye In Formation", "meta_data": {"title": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Go-To Makeup Artist Explains How to Get Your Cat Eye In Formation", "description": "For even the most seasoned beauty pro, cat eyes still present major challenges \u2014 ranging from imbalanced wings to sloppy sketching.
