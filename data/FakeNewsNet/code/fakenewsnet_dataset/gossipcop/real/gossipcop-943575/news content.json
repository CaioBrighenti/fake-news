A soul that spoke 1,000 languages. Kid, I will miss you and anyone that ever got to know you will miss you.\n\n\"Countless flights, 100 nights in the airstream, driving across the country, jumping in every lake - river - stream and ocean there was, just for a splash and to be happy. Thank you for loving me like I\u2019ve never known. I know you're here, your energy is here with us - I saw you playing with Neech this morning. I love you kiddo. Love, Dad\".\n\nThe former Vampire Diaries star also posted a photo of himself and Ira on Instagram.\n\nHis wife expressed similar sentiments, posting a series of snaps of herself and Ira, alongside a note that read: \"You've been my best friend for so long, and as I sit here and write you this letter, I still don't know if I am able to say goodbye.\n\n\"You are the definition of unconditional love my gorgeous girl. Every chapter of my life feels like it wouldn't have been as special without you, and now I don't know how to let you go. I'm going to miss that goofy toothy grin, and watching you stretch your head up to the sky after every nap\".\n\nThe couple often shared photos of Ira on social media.", "images": ["https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x400/2019/07/12/00138850.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/assets/img/logo.png", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/11/00138775.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138863.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/11/00138783.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2018/06/13/00121545.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/ian-somerhalder-and-nikki-reed-regret-goofy-story-about-birth-control-pills.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2018/12/20/00130292.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2019/03/27/00134393.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138846.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2018/05/15/00120103.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138860.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/11/00138793.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/11/00138773.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2018/06/13/00121545.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138845.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138847.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138834.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/11/00138777.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138851.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2018/06/13/00121545.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00121545.html", "title": "Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed Mourning the Death of Their Dog", "meta_data": {"description": "Ira passed away from cancer on Tuesday in Los Angeles.", "keywords": "Nikki Reed,Ian Somerhalder", "news_keywords": "Nikki Reed,Ian Somerhalder", "author": "WENN", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 320088948016615}, "og": {"title": "Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed Mourning the Death of Their Dog", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00121545.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2018/06/13/00121545.jpg", "alt": "Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed Mourning the Death of Their Dog"}, "site_name": "AceShowbiz", "description": "Ira passed away from cancer on Tuesday in Los Angeles."}, "twitter": {"title": "Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed Mourning the Death of Their Dog", "description": "Ira passed away from cancer on Tuesday in Los Angeles.", "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/photo/2018/06/13/00121545.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@aceshowbiz", "creator": "@aceshowbiz", "domain": "aceshowbiz.com"}, "robots": "index, follow", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "theme-color": "#5F256F"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com", "summary": ""}
