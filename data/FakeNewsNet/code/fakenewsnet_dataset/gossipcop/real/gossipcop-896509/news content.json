The two are set to be married in the Spring of 2018.\n\nThe pair began dating about a year and a half ago, when they were introduced by a mutual friend. They were first photographed together in December of 2016, while shopping for a Christmas tree.\n\nEven before then, however, Prince Harry said the two had gotten to known each other on private dates \u2013 including a five-day camping trip in Botswana that he described as \"fantastic\".\n\nWhile the pair waxed eloquent about many parts of their courtship, they admitted that there have been some rough patches, too.\n\nLast November, Prince Harry made an unusual public statement defending his then-girlfriend, and chiding the press for the \"racial undertones\" in their coverage of the relationship. Ms Markle, whose mother is black and father is white, will be the first mixed-race person to marry a senior member of the royal family.\n\nOn Monday, the couple revealed how they had survived the onslaught of press coverage.\n\n\"You know, it was just obvious that no matter what we were being put through, that it was just temporary and that we were going to be able to get through that,\" Mr Markle said, adding that her friends and family all approved of the match.\n\nPrince Harry added that the two had received \"fantastic support\" from his family. In fact, he believes his mother, Princess Diana, would have loved his new fiance, too.\n\n\"I'm sure she's with us yeah, you know, jumping up and down somewhere else,\" he said.", "images": ["https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/27/18/gettyimages-880256008.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/27/18/gettyimages-880256008.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Shugerman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-proposal-roast-chicken-dinner-latest-news-updatest-a8078931.html", "title": "Prince Harry reveals he proposed to Meghan Markle while cooking roast chicken", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-proposal-roast-chicken-dinner-latest-news-updatest-a8078931.html", "title": "Meghan Markle reveals how Prince Harry proposed to her in their first TV interview", "description": "'It was so sweet and natural and very romantic,' Ms Markle says", "updated_time": "2017-11-27T19:18:28+00:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/27/18/gettyimages-880256008.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "video": {"identifier": "https://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/624246174001/624246174001_5660921302001_5660334003001.mp4?pubId=624246174001&videoId=5660334003001", "type": "application/octet-stream"}}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/8078931"}, "description": "Prince Harry has revealed that he proposed to fiance Meghan Markle in the kitchen, over a roast chicken.
