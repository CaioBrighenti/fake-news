Based on a comic series, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is said to be nothing like the 1996 series Sabrina the Teenage Witch starring Melissa Joan Hart\u2014but how so? The show doesn't premiere until October 2018, but thankfully, Netflix just teased some photos and new details. Here's everything concrete we know so far about your next TV obsession.\n\n1. It will premiere on October 26, 2018. Just in time for Halloween, natch. The show's been green-lit for two, 20-episode seasons.\n\n2. It's created and executive produced by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the brain behind Riverdale. So expect a dark, edgy approach to the material.\n\nNetflix\n\n3. Kiernan Shipka is playing Sabrina Spellman. You probably recognize her from Mad Men, but she also played Bette Davis' daughter in the FX series Feud: Bette and Joan.\n\n4. This version is way scarier than the 1996 series starring Melissa Joan Hart. \"Tonally in the vein of Rosemary\u2019s Baby and The Exorcist, this adaptation finds Sabrina wrestling to reconcile her dual nature\u2014half-witch, half-mortal\u2014while standing against the evil forces that threaten her, her family, and the daylight world humans inhabit,\" reads Netflix's press release about the series. Netflix also calls the show a \"dark coming-of-age story that traffics in horror, the occult and, of course, witchcraft.\"", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b71e3f542056c0bbc67e644/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/CAS_102_Unit_00689R3.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d971f11040d8257aedec62/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/pne%2520day.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d03e7d20cd0cf160fe2968a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/cowboy%2520adventure.jpeg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1533651631/glamour_bachelor-in-paradise-s-ashley-and-jared-take-a-friendship-test.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b71d6b99d5ece7165a508ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sabrina.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b71d6b99d5ece7165a508ed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/sabrina.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b71d6b99d5ece7165a508ed/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/sabrina.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b71d6b99d5ece7165a508ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sabrina.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Anna Moeslein", "Christopher Rosa", "Christopher Ros", "Perrie Samotin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-chilling-adventures-of-sabrina-netflix-details", "title": "Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina: Everything We Know So Far", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' is being rebooted for Netflix.
