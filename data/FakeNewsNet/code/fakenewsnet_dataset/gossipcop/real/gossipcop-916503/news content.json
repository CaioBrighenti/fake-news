News and blasted her co-stars; telling the outlet that if she had her way half the current cast would get the ax.\n\n\u201cHoney, I don\u2019t have an executive seat at Bravo, but if I did, half of this cast would be gone,\u201d NeNe admitted. \u201cTrust me. I would not have them here working.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NeNe is also advocating for her BFF Marlo Hampton to get a peach and become a full-time cast member in the future. Marlo has been part of RHOA since season 4 and has always brought the drama but remains only a friend of the Housewives to this day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said I think she deserves a peach. Now, I don\u2019t think the whole cast was supportive of her having a peach until me and her fell out. When we fell out, then they were all the way here for her having a peach and taking pictures with her and hanging out with her. Then when we got back cool again, now they\u2019re all like all over the place,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, listen, Marlo\u2019s super funny, she\u2019s a great addition to the show. I don\u2019t care if she has a peach if she stays a friend of the show, she\u2019s being seen a lot. I think she\u2019s OK. But I thought she deserved it.\u201d\n\nNeNe claims that some of the friends on RHOA are bringing it more than certain full-time Housewives but aren\u2019t reaping the benefits of a full-time paycheck.\n\n\u201cThe reason why is there are people being paid on this show who need to be a friend to the show. And they need to spread that check around to somebody who\u2019s really bringing something to the show,\u201d she said. \u201cThese folks getting these big checks who really don\u2019t need them, I would spread them around to some of the friends on the show who bring the drama. Or demote some of these people to friends. You know who I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\nSo, which co-stars does NeNe want to go? She\u2019s not telling \u2013 yet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of girls I would not give a peach back to, but the moment I start naming them is the moment I have an argument with everybody on the cast because they swear that you are trying to stop them from eating,\u201d NeNe wrapped. \u201cNo honey, you\u2019re stopping yourself when you\u2019re boring.\u201d\n\nI have to agree with NeNe cuts need to be made on RHOA or the ladies need to step up their game big time. Some of the ATL Housewives are so dull this season! I think Kenya and Porsha and even maybe Sheree need to go. Buh-Bye!\n\nThoughts on NeNe\u2019s interview? Which of her co-stars do you think NeNe wants to see gone? Should Bravo make Marlo a full-time Housewife? Are some of the full-time Housewives slacking this season?
