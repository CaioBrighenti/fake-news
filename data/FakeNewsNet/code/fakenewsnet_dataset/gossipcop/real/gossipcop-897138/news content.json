His most notable Twitter moment was probably earlier this year, when he called out James Woods, who made a comment about the age difference between Hammer\u2019s character and his love interest, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, in \u201cCall Me By Your Name.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you date a 19 year old when you were 60\u2026\u2026.?\u201d Hammer replied, spurring a response by actress Amber Tamblyn, who recalled Woods trying to pick up her and her friend when she was only 16.\n\nAlso Read: 'Call Me by Your Name,' 'Darkest Hour' Keep Indie Box Office Roaring\n\nHammer\u2019s first response to the BuzzFeed article was a \u201cbitter AF\u201d tweet, which is, alas, now gone, along with everything else.\n\nThe article discusses the \u201cmany second chances\u201d Hammer has had in his career, saying the Hollywood system gives handsome, straight white men more chances than women and minorities.\n\nThe article was met with mixed reactions. Many agreed that Hollywood should be more diverse and inclusive, but took issue with personalizing that point by focusing on Hammer.\n\nAlso Read: 'Call Me by Your Name' Film Review: Senses Working Overtime in Lush Summer Romance\n\nNow, fans are lamenting the loss of Hammer\u2019s Twitter. Don\u2019t worry, though, his Instagram is still up and running.\n\nme showing up at buzzfeed hq because they made Armie Hammer delete his twitter pic.twitter.com/upsykqKVld \u2014 anna swanson (@annaswnsn) November 28, 2017\n\nProtect good men like armie hammer, henry cavill, keanu reeves, ryan gosling and chris pine from toxic journalists please \u2014 jenny (@clarkjoes) November 28, 2017\n\npsa: armie hammer is a REAL person with REAL feelings who deserves a lot more appreciation than he receives. \u2014 emily (@sweeteachalamet) November 28, 2017\n\nAlso Read: Armie Hammer Totally Shuts Down James Woods for Dissing Gay Romance 'Call Me by Your Name'\n\nYou all ran Armie Hammer off of Twitter.
