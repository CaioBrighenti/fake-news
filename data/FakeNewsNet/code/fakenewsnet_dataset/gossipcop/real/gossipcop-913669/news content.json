Well, once upon a time, around 3rd Century there was a tyrannical ruler of Rome named Claudius II and a Christian martyr named Saint Valentine. The theory of Valentine\u2019s Day being the day dedicated to love has got a lot to do with history. Many folklore's emerge out of the history pages to support this day. One such story says that Claudius was against Christianity while Valentine was for it and Claudius imprisoned him and in this imprisonment, he fell in love with the blind girl of the jailer. Before his death he wrote a letter to this girl and signed it as \u201cfrom your Valentine\u201d and that\u2019s how till today lovers address each other as Valentine. The day next to his death on 14th February Julia, the girl of the jailer planted an almond tree near his grave and till today almond tree is a sign of love and friendship. And people across the world celebrate love and affection.\n\nAnother myth says that Claudius was against marriage of young men as he believed unmarried men prove to be better soldiers. The hero named Valentine helped these young men to flee and marry and that\u2019s how he became the undying symbol of love.\n\nUntil 14th Century Valentine was not associated with love and romance and it was Chaucer who started this association through his poetry in Parliament of Foules. One famous line is: \u201cFor this was on St. Valentine's Day when every bird cometh there to choose his mate\u201d. Valentine\u2019s feast day has been illustriously celebrated as a lovers\u2019 holiday and a day of romance since the 14th century. The feast of Saint Valentine was established by Pope Gelasius I in the year 496. Some holds the view that Valentine\u2019s feast day is celebrated in February because the church wanted to Christianize an ancient Roman pagan festival called Lupercalia that focused around fecundity and sanitization, and also took place in February.\n\nBest Gift Ideas for Your Honey \u2013 Search for One on Ferns N Petals\n\nValentine\u2019s Day means a get together of lovers.
