It feels a little scary.\u201d\n\nAnna\u2019s entrance into the literary world has been described as \u201cpart memoir, part humorous, unflinching advice\u201d on relationships and \u201cfinding love.\u201d Another interesting chapter of the book will come through the foreword which was previously reported by E! News to be written by Chris Pratt.\n\nThe biggest question that fans have been wondering is whether Anna will discuss her failed relationship with Pratt. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe how revealing you were,\u201d her podcast co-host Sim Sarna shared, \u201cbecause there was so much that you hadn\u2019t told me personally that I read in the book for the first time.\u201d\n\nAlthough she is thrilled to share this side of herself, the House Bunny actress also admitted she is more terrified than ever. She addressed her fans in the podcast by stating, \u201cDear listeners,\u201d she began, \u201cI would love it so much if you picked up my book. But please know, I am so scared. I feel like leaving the country for a while. I\u2019m breaking into a sweat as we talk about it.\u201d\n\nUnqualified is set to be released Oct. 24.", "images": ["https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_74,$w_115/f10/2019/07/JPI_Episode11710_0001845075-620x400.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/logo-white.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/trending_up.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/03/16741673-400x400.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/qool-logo-white.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2017/11/00588824-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/06/31221907-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/06/15731673-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/04/04340540-400x400-1.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/06/11275720-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/08/GettyImages-873509978-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/06/20105510-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2017/01/Friends-4-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2016/01/Joshua-Morrow1-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2016/01/Anthony-Geary-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2018/12/20021756-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_74,$w_115/f10/2016/08/11309338-620x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_80,$w_125/f10/2016/11/shutterstock_322074566.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/07/JPI_061717PC_DDiamont0001698648-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/03/GettyImages-181674942-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/08/19598558-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_74,$w_115/f10/2019/07/JPI_Episode11672_0001835584-620x400.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/logo.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_140,$w_140/f10/2016/11/shutterstock_322074566-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/03/Joey-TV-Show-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/11/shutterstock_322074566-400x400.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13331473-620x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/05/Mom-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2019/06/19481305-400x400.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/fametenV2/images/concourse-logo-white.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2015/06/08814963-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/07/shutterstock_309007556-400x400.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_170,$w_170/f10/2018/12/JPI_Episode9730a_68824-400x400.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13331473-620x400.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Di Pede"], "canonical_link": "https://www.fame10.com/trending-news/anna-faris-feels-like-leaving-the-country-after-release-of-her-memoir/", "title": "Anna Faris Feels Like \u201cLeaving The Country\u201d After Release Of Her Memoir", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1130, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Anna Faris definitely has some mixed emotions when it comes to the release of her upcoming memoir, Unqualified!
