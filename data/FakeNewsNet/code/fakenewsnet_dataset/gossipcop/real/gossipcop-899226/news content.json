Kardashian completed her look with black leggings, black sneakers, and oversize reflective shades as she made her way.\n\nImage zoom INSTARimages.com\n\nShe kept her platinum blonde locks parted to the side and threw a bag over her shoulder, rather than palming her staple Birkin bag that she has rocked the last couple of times she has hit the airport.\n\nConsidering just how much Kardashian has been on the go lately, we may have to dub her the queen of casual-chic maternity airport style\u2014once she directly addresses her pregnancy.\n\nFor now, the reality mogul, who is reportedly expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, is keeping her bump and the details under wraps.", "images":
