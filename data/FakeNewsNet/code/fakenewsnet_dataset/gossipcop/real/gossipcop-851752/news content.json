He surprised fans with a super mellow version of Kanye's hit, \"Ultralight Beam.\"\n\nThe British singer just dropped his first solo album Friday, so you'd think he'd stick to pumping up his own songs, but let's be honest -- Harry could sing the phone book, and his fans would love it.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/11/4by3/2019/07/12/11c1ff947cb24f9dbf03a643200362cb_md.jpg",
