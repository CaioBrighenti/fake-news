Because this video of two foster children learning they\u2019re being adopted will definitely get your tears flowing. (Don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.)\n\nCourtney and Tom Gilmour of Portland, Pennsylvania have fostered 12-year-old Janielle and 10-year-old Elijah for the last three years. The couple had long planned to adopt the children and were waiting for an official court date when one was finally confirmed in April, just as the family left for a trip to Orlando, Florida, to visit the Magic Kingdom.\n\nWhen the family checked into the park, they were handed buttons to write down what they were there to celebrate. Courtney wrote \u201cadopting our kids\u201d on her and Tom\u2019s buttons, took a picture of it, and tweeted it the Walt Disney World Twitter account. A Disney representative contacted Courtney a short time later asking how they could make their stay a little extra special. \u201cI thought that they were going to give us free dessert!\u201d Courtney tells PEOPLE.\n\nInstead, the park had something much bigger in mind, and it involved their most famous star.\n\nA video posted by Courtney on July 6 shows the family attending a surprise meet and greet with Mickey at the back of the Town Street Theater at Disney World. \u201cThe kids have never been there before, so it didn\u2019t set off any flags that something was happening, we didn\u2019t make it a big deal,\u201d Courtney says.\n\nThe footage shows Mickey signing Janielle and Elijah\u2019s guestbook and performing a card trick before a sign is brought out to the kids with a date written across it: May 24, 2017, the day they would officially be adopted. Upon seeing it, both children burst into tears.\n\nFinally, the long wait was over.\n\nThe May 24 adoption ceremony at a local courthouse was filled with friends and family. Courtney says that the day was especially important for Janielle, who has been her brother\u2019s protector for all their lives. \u201cWhen the adoption happened, you saw all of that roll off of her,\u201d she says. \u201cShe knew she did not have to have that role anymore and it just came out in tears.\u201d\n\nSince it was posted, the video has been viewed more than 1.6 million times, and Courtney hopes that at least some of its viewers might become inspired to get involved in foster care.\n\n\u201cWhatever hoops we had to jump through, we jumped through because Janielle and Elijah are worth it,\u201d Courtney says. \u201cThere was a lot of crying and laughing and screaming in those three years, but we got to the end goal. We got the happy ending.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/38f048d622d7a8e3239b68c777a325ef?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/elena-struthers-gardner.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/farnan-4.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/49114105_10213978926250616_1687262753883947008_o-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kianti-champion.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/54212912_147375162962023_4302311544756985366_n.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/michael-pruitt-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-636971928.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screen-shot-2019-07-12-at-10.59.19-am.png?crop=0px%2C247px%2C832px%2C438px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ticket.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/crash-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/picu-nurses-3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/canada-air-incident-5.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/new-orleans-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chris-cline-split.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bridge.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/40241528_1561605470292723_r.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/disney-mickey-adoption.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rodriguez-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dji_0034-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/earthquake-hero.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/colten-raymer-birthday.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/disney-mickey-adoption.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Duaine Hahn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/human-interest/mickey-mouse-helps-foster-parents-tell-two-kids-theyre-officially-being-adopted/", "title": "Mickey Mouse Helps Foster Parents Tell Two Kids They're Officially Being Adopted", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "mickey mouse, disney, adoption, sweet, video, disney world, orlando, florida", "news_keywords": "mickey mouse, disney, adoption, sweet, video, disney world, orlando, florida", "description": "When two foster children find out they are being adopted, Mickey Mouse helps to break the news.", "og": {"title": "Mickey Mouse Helps Foster Parents Tell Two Kids They're Officially Being Adopted", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/mickey-mouse-helps-foster-parents-tell-two-kids-theyre-officially-being-adopted/", "description": "When two foster children find out they are being adopted, Mickey Mouse helps to break the news.", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/disney-mickey-adoption.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/human-interest/mickey-mouse-helps-foster-parents-tell-two-kids-theyre-officially-being-adopted/", "description": "When two foster children find out they are being adopted, Mickey Mouse helps to break the news.", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/disney-mickey-adoption.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/mickey-mouse-helps-foster-parents-tell-two-kids-theyre-officially-being-adopted/", "title": "Mickey Mouse Helps Foster Parents Tell Two Kids They're Officially Being Adopted", "description": "When two foster children find out they are being adopted, Mickey Mouse helps to break the news.", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/disney-mickey-adoption.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
