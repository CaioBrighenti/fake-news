The 22-year-old Call Me By Your Name actor opened up about his recent Golden Globes experience to Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday\u2019s Tonight Show.\n\nNoting that he took his sister as his date, Chalamet said, \u201cShe had a great time. We got to talk to Angelina Jolie and talked to Jennifer Aniston right after, and I was like, \u2018Oh my god! Which side are we on?\u2019\u201d\n\nFallon laughed at Chalamet\u2019s candid response to meeting the two A-listers but the up-and-coming actor noted, \u201cHey, man. I\u2019m not [always] hobnobbing with famous people. I\u2019m like, \u2018What the f**k is going on?!\u2019\u201d\n\nChalamet also opened up about his recent snafu at the New York Film Festival, where he fell out of his chair on stage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting in the chair for the Q&A and then a gravitational force comes out of nowhere and knocks me out of the chair and I fall back,\u201d he quipped. \u201cThere was a girl in the audience that night I was super psyched was there and then that happened.\u201d\n\nChalamet is certainly one of the stars to watch this awards season. He appeared in both nominated films Call Me By Your Name and Lady Bird.
