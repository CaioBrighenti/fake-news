Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration, calling it an \u201cexercise in living with disappointment, dysfunction and dishonesty,\u201d according to the Associated Press.\n\nNixon accused Cuomo of creating inequality via tax cuts that favor corporations and wealthy New Yorkers, and said the state should focus on issues like fully funding public schools, reforming campaign finance rules and \u2014 with the topic fresh on her mind \u2014 getting the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees the subway, to fix the system.\n\nNixon, best known for her role as Miranda Hobbes on the HBO series \u201cSex and the City,\u201d announced her campaign in an ad released Monday.\n\nI love New York, and today I'm announcing my candidacy for governor.

But she\u2019s never run an organization. This is a time to move away from celebrity and toward progressive leadership.\u201d\n\nThat celebrity did prompt a number of \u201cSex and the City\u201d-themed responses on Twitter:\n\nthere's no one i trust to fix the subway more than miranda hobbes, the person responsible for the best new york transportation-related simile on tv pic.twitter.com/gSo6f5JzMG \u2014 Hannah Giorgis (@ethiopienne) March 19, 2018\n\n\u201c...I couldn\u2019t help but wonder...could Miranda fix the subway?
