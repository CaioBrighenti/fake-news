Based on the Marvel Comics characters, it depicts Rocket Raccoon recruiting guests to attempt to free the remaining Guardians of the Galaxy from display within the Collector's fortress.[1]\n\nThe attraction uses the same infrastructure and ride system as the previous attraction, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.[3] It features several cast members from the Marvel Studios film series reprising their characters.[4] The attraction is inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), being instead part of its own similarly shared universe, the Marvel Theme Park Universe (MTPU).[5][6][7]\n\nIt opened on May 27, 2017, twenty-two days after the release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.[1][2]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nAnnounced at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, the attraction replaced The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, which closed on January 3, 2017.[1][8][9][10] It is the first Disney attraction based on Marvel Comics characters in the United States, and will be followed in 2020 by a Marvel-themed area at Disney California Adventure.[11][12][13]\n\nChris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Benicio del Toro, and Bradley Cooper reprise their roles as Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, The Collector, and the voice of Rocket, respectively.[14][15] Due to Marvel's 1994 contract with Universal Parks & Resorts (pre-dating Disney's 2009 purchase of Marvel Entertainment), the Marvel brand is not allowed to be used as part of the ride's title or advertising.[16] James Gunn directed all of the scenes involving the cast.\n\nTyler Bates, composer of the Guardians of the Galaxy films, wrote the incidental music for the attraction's queue.[17] The attraction also features six songs for the ride's six drop profiles, some of which were suggested by Gunn.[18][19]\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nThe attraction is based in the Collector's fortress-esque collection called the Tivan Collection, as seen in the film Guardians of the Galaxy. The Collector (Taneleer Tivan) is showing off his latest acquisitions, the Guardians of the Galaxy, in customized display cases. However, Rocket has secretly escaped his case and asks the guests for help. Guests then board a gantry lift, where they help Rocket try to free the other Guardians.[1]\n\nQueue and preshow\n\nGuests enter the main floor which is meant to resemble the interior of the Collector's archive. The archive itself houses a number of interactive artifacts. A video plays on loop of the Collector and his new assistant revealing that they have a new addition to the Tivan Collection, the Guardians of the Galaxy themselves. It is revealed through their banter that the Guardians, specifically Peter Quill, were tricked into coming to visit as they thought they too were going to be given a tour of the facility. The Collector has their glass cases electrified so that the team cannot escape, yet Rocket is still determined to get out (and later, it is revealed that he managed to escape his case). The Collector reveals to the guests that they can access the facility once their biological signs are scanned into the system and then all they have to do is raise their hands for clearance.\n\nAfterwards, the guests are led into the Collector's office where another video of himself begins playing. Suddenly Rocket, portrayed through an audio animatronic, enters the room through a vent and hijacks the video to explain his plan for rescuing his friends. (In the event of an animatronic malfunction, a CGI version of Rocket will appear on the screen to hijack the Collector's spiel) The guests will use their access passes (their hand scan) for access in the lift while Rocket rides on top to blow up the generator so that the Guardians, as well as the other creatures in the collection, can escape. The Guardians will then reunite with Mantis who will arrive with their ship so that they can make a quick getaway. On his way out of the Collector's office, Rocket grabs Quill's walkman.\n\nRide\n\nAfter guests are seated in the gantry lift, the Collector tells the riders that \"this is the moment you've been waiting for.\" However, Rocket unplugs the system and inserts Quill's walkman starting one of the songs listed above. The lift quickly rises up to the generator room where Rocket blows it up, opening the cages and freeing the team, but also cutting the power to the gantry lift. Rocket tries to regain control as the lift accelerates up and down, and guests see the Guardians entangled in various situations, as well as getting a brief view of Disneyland. Rocket finally restores power and the lift drops down to show the Guardians reunited along with Mantis and Cosmo the Spacedog. Quill and Gamora thank the guests, but as the lift resets itself, Drax is heard asking why they are thanking them as all the guests did was sit through the whole ordeal and did not actually do any fighting.\n\nAs guests leave the gantry lift and exit down a corridor, the sounds of the escaping creatures can be heard. The Collector can be heard over the intercom, upset over the loss of the Guardians and his creatures. Howard the Duck can also occasionally be heard, mocking the Collector's misfortune and bidding guests farewell.\n\nThere are six different versions of the ride, each with its own song, visuals, and drop sequence. The six songs, and their sequences, are as follows[24]\n\n\"I Want You Back\" - The Jackson 5 (1969): The first scenario is of the Guardians jumping from their confinement, only for Drax to get captured by a tentacled monster. The second scenario shows Quill kicking a rat-like creature into the cages before being attacked by a group of them.\n\n\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\" - Pat Benatar (1980): The first scenario shows Peter Quill shooing away the tentacled monster, ending with the both of them and Gamora (who is in the same scenario) running from a fleet of security drones. The next scenario shows a giant, gargoyle-esque monster jumping up and roaring at the guests. Drax jumps out of the creature's mouth, punches it on the nose and laughs. He then says to the guests, \"You're welcome!\"\n\n\"Give Up The Funk\" - Parliament (1975): The first scenario has Quill and Gamora in the tentacles of the tentacled monster, with Quill and Gamora asking Rocket for help. The following scenario shows Quill kicking a rat-like creature into the cages before being attacked by a group of them.\n\n\"Free Ride\" - The Edgar Winter Group (1973): The first scenario is of the Guardians shooting at the oncoming attacks before Baby Groot pushes a red button that turns off the artificial gravity. The next scenario, respectively, shows everything floating while Quill tells Baby Groot to press the button that puts on the artificial gravity. He does, but everything in the collection falls, including the Gantry Lift.\n\n\"Burning Love\" - Elvis Presley (1972): The first scenario is of the Guardians jumping from their confinement, only for Drax to get captured by the tentacled monster. The second scenario shows the giant, gargoyle-esque monster jumping up and roaring at the guests. Drax jumps out of the creature's mouth, punches it on the nose and laughs. He then says to the guests, \"You're welcome!\"\n\n\"Born to Be Wild\" - Steppenwolf (1968): The first scenario has Quill and Gamora in the tentacles of the tentacled monster, with Quill and Gamora shouting at Rocket for help. The following scene, respectively, shows Quill shooing away the monster, ending with the both of them and Gamora (who is in the same scenario) running from a fleet of security drones.\n\nCollector's archive [ edit ]\n\nWithin the waiting area, guests are allowed to view the many items in the Collector's archive. The artifacts are expected to be in rotation.[25] Various items from Guardians of the Galaxy, the Marvel Universe, and inactive audio-animatronics from Disney attractions are present including:\n\nMore items are located in the Collector's office including:\n\nIn addition, in the video message from the Collector there is a maquette of a ghost dog from The Haunted Mansion on the table.\n\nWhen guests enter the maintenance room before entering the gantry lift more items can be found such as:\n\nMonsters After Dark [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2017, it was announced that the attraction would receive a new experience during Halloween Time at the Disneyland Resort called Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Monsters After Dark. The experience is offered after sunset each night from early-September through October 31. The storyline of Monsters After Dark takes place chronologically after the events of Mission Breakout!; the Guardians have just escaped but accidentally left Groot behind. Rocket returns and has guests distract all of the escaped creatures so he can find and rescue Groot. One of the creatures in Monsters After Dark is Surtur's Fire Dragon, which also appears in Thor: Ragnarok. The experience also features a new song titled \"Monsters After Dark\" written by Tyler Bates.[30][31] On October 31, the attraction operated as Monsters After Dark all day.[32] The song was released as a digital single on iTunes on November 2, 2017.[33] It returned for the Halloween season in 2018 with no changes.\n\nThe ghost of Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) briefly appears wandering the hallways of the archive in the pre-show.[34]\n\nSee also [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Blue_pencil.svg/10px-Blue_pencil.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Global_thinking.svg/10px-Global_thinking.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/GOTG_ride_%2834404621430%29.jpg/1200px-GOTG_ride_%2834404621430%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/GOTG_ride_%2834404621430%29.jpg/290px-GOTG_ride_%2834404621430%29.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/GOTG_ride_%2834404621430%29.jpg/1200px-GOTG_ride_%2834404621430%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_%E2%80%93_Mission:_Breakout!", "title": "Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: Breakout!", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.34.0-wmf.13", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/GOTG_ride_%2834404621430%29.jpg/1200px-GOTG_ride_%2834404621430%29.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
