It's possible that Winter is still dealing with residual issues from her upbringing \u2014 particularly her strained relationship with her mom.\n\nA brief recap: The TV star claimed her mom had been emotionally and physically abusive, as reported by the BBC. Winter became an emancipated minor in May 2015 and, as such, was forced to grow up much faster than other children her age. \"I've kind of been in adulthood for a little bit now,\" she told People magazine in January 2016.\n\nWe can't say for sure that her traumatic childhood caused her to cling to people who can give her the type of love and stability she may have missed out on as a kid, but it'd make sense if that were the case.", "images": ["https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/strange-things-about-ariel-winters-relationship/take-care-of-me-but-youre-on-your-own-1539631081.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/strange-things-about-ariel-winters-relationship/intro-1539631081.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/strange-things-about-ariel-winters-relationship/intro-1539631081.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/strange-things-about-ariel-winters-relationship/intro-1539631081.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stassi Reid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/135470/strange-things-about-ariel-winters-relationship/", "title": "Strange things about Ariel Winter's relationship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "//img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/strange-things-about-ariel-winters-relationship/intro-1539631081.jpg", "title": "Strange things about Ariel Winter's relationship", "description": "Modern Family's Ariel Winter went from being a child star to a stunning adult in the blink of an eye, and with adulthood came a brand new relationship with Canadian actor Levi Meaden.
