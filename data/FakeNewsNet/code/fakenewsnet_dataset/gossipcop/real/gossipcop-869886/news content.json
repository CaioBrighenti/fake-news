Matt Bomer revealed that he wasn\u2019t aware of the rumored drama on set between his Magic Mike costars, Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer.\n\nThe American Horror Story star, 39, never witnessed any awkward moments between Tatum, 37, and Pettyfer, 27. \u201cOn set in the first film, everybody was really professional. Channing is one of the most fun people I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d Bomer explained while appearing as a guest on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Thursday, July 27. \u201cHe set a great tone and no, they both came to work on time, did great work and there was never any undercurrent of tension that I witnessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, just because the White Collar alum wasn\u2019t privy to the drama, that doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t any! \u201cI was a little feverous about what I was wearing at the time,\u201d he told Cohen of his minimal clothing in the film. \u201cSo maybe I wasn\u2019t noticing these undercurrents.\u201d\n\nAs Us Weekly exclusively reported when the first Magic Mike film premiered in 2012, the 21 Jump Street star \u201chates\u201d his younger costar, who ironically admired his character in the flick. \u201cThey had massive fights on set,\u201d a source told Us at the time. \u201cChanning thought Alex was a diva on set.\u201d\n\nAnother insider disclosed Pettyfer brewed their beef by behaving disrespectfully on set. \u201cAlex was a jerk to everyone during filming,\u201d the source said of the Beastly actor, who played a character based on former male revue performer Tatum. \u201c[Alex] thinks he\u2019s the star of the movie, not Channing or Matthew McConaughey.\u201d\n\nAlthough the tumultuous two kept it cool for the film\u2019s press tour in 2012, Pettyfer did not return to reprise his role as Adam in the blockbuster\u2019s sequel, Magic Mike XXL. Shortly after the film premiered, the British-born actor opened up about his quarrel with Tatum, who told everyone on set about their drama. \u201cWhat Channing says goes. He\u2019s a movie star. He\u2019s incredible,\u201d Pettyfer told Bret Easton Ellis in a November 2015 podcast interview. \u201cI was scared to speak. I actually did my work and I sat in the corner and listened to music because I had been told that anything that I do was wrong by my reps.\u201d\n\nAccording to Pettyfer, the agitation between the costars arose after Pettyfer rented a New York apartment from Tatum\u2019s friends, but moved out shortly after, citing mold and dust throughout the pad. \u201cAll of a sudden I got a very negative email from Channing, rightfully so, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t f\u2013k my friends. You owe money. Pay the f\u2013king money. Don\u2019t be a clown.\u2019 I really took that the wrong way, which I shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d the I Am Number Four star, who at the time was also mourning the death of his cousin, admitted. \u201c[I] emailed him back saying, \u2018I\u2019m in a negative headspace, can you respect me for a moment?\u2019 And I just got hounded through this time of grieving for money.\u201d\n\nWhen all is said and done, the Wild Child actor admitted to fault. \u201cIt was me who made the poor decision,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot him. I made the poor decision.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
