But other times, in the strongest moments - maybe through the words of Alice Cooper or Freddie Mercury, through Cronenberg films, or even in Chewbacca's growl, I experienced something deeper - the realization that I wasn't completely alone.\"\n\nGunn stressed to fans who may feel how he once felt that they are not alone.\n\n\"They're a group of heartbroken misfits whose lives have been bereft of tenderness and connection and who have a nearly impossible time trusting themselves or others,\" Gunn wrote. \"But they're learning, one step at a time. They are me. They are you. We are Groot.\"\n\nGunn expressed his heartfelt thanks to fans around the world flocking to theaters to see his latest film.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 shot to $56.3 million Friday for a weekend debut in the $140 million range at the North American box office.\n\nRead Gunn's full post below.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/static/frontend/2017_05_02_1701/assets//images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/05/guardiansvol2590a8457dadb6-h_2017.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn2.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn3.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/05/guardiansvol2590a845794783-h_2017.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn2.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/05/rocket_racoon_bill_mantlo_inset.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn3.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/scale_crop_768_433/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_heatvision.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn2.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Parker", "Ryan.Parker Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-opens-up-lengthy-heartfelt-message-fans-1000871", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message To Fans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-opens-up-lengthy-heartfelt-message-fans-1000871", "domain": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message To Fans", "description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn2.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message To Fans", "description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-opens-up-lengthy-heartfelt-message-fans-1000871", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170507031337im_/http://cdn2.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message To Fans", "sailthru.description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "sailthru.author": "Ryan Parker", "sailthru.channel": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.vertical": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-06 13:33:27", "sailthru.tags": "Heat Vision, Movies, James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494092007.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
