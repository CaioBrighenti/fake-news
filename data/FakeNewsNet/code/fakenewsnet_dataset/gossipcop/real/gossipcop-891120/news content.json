(This is a girl who recently dressed up as naked cyborg version of herself, after all.) But there is one very important piece of information in the video that may settle the \"Who is this damn song about?\" debate for good, and it all has to do with the song's most controversial lyric, which was apparently changed between the original and final version.\n\nThe phrase that made it into the song (and sparked a million Swift vs. Harris comment wars on social media) is \"I've got a boyfriend, he's older than us / he's at the club doing I don't know what.\" It makes it seem like she's referencing Calvin Harris, the DJ she dated in 2015. He's older than she is, it's his job to be at a club\u2026the shoe more or less fits. But as we learn from the behind-the-scenes footage, the line was originally written as, \"I've got a boyfriend, he's older than us / I haven't seen him in a couple of months.\"\n\nWatch, below:\n\nCould this be the peak into Hiddleswift folklore we've been waiting for?\n\nSwift already confirmed that the gorgeous fellow in the song is her current boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. But fans have still been left confused about the timeline of who she was dating when she met him. Alwyn and Swift allegedly met at a Kings of Leon concert four months after she and Calvin broke up, which is why the \"in the club line\" was such a head-scratcher. My personal theory? The song is really about falling in love with Alwyn while she was dating Tom Hiddleston, and in true T. Swift style, she changed the lyric on the recorded version to keep it purposely vague.\n\nThe Reputation album debuts on November 10, so even though this mystery may finally be figured out, there is a lot more googling in our futures.\n\nRelated: How Taylor Swift is Counting on Fashion to Change Her 'Reputation'", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d2723dc9ee31200080ad342/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d066d9f8116e3707dac6595/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/599de8316746a8222b26fe81/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ts_kp.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1481599096/glamour_taylor-swift-a-look-back-at-where-it-all-started.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d03843adaf4bdc3e68a1ef2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1153173070.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fa0524110b841b972edb01/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-walking-getty-images.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d052e7c0cd0cf4c6ee296a6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-133627811.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d08cd8ff2e740fd63677528/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/61672430_599121707245821_1209817683281936149_n.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa", "Zoe Weine", "Natasha Reda"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-shares-songwriting-process-behind-gorgeous", "title": "Taylor Swift Shares the Songwriting Process Behind 'Gorgeous' in This New Video", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Taylor Swift released a behind-the-scenes video of the making of 'Gorgeous,' complete with never-before-heard original lyrics.", "keywords": "taylor swift,snd,reputation,music", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Tay, stop messing with us!", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Taylor Swift Just Revealed the Original Lyrics for 'Gorgeous,' and It Changes Everything", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-shares-songwriting-process-behind-gorgeous"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Tay, stop messing with us!", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Taylor Swift Just Revealed the Original Lyrics for 'Gorgeous,' and It Changes Everything"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bu2Djx2ejlA"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
