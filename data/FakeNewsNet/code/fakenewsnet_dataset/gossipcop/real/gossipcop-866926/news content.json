Just to have someone who you just like is so important, and someone [who] is honest.\u201d\n\nFall 2001\n\nThe pair appears on the cover of Vanity Fair\u2018s November 2001 music issue. JAY-Z later told the magazine, \u201cwe were just beginning to try to date each other\u201d at the time, adding: \u201cWell, you know, you\u2019ve got to try first. You got to dazzle . . . wine and dine,\u201d and that he had his work cut out for him pursuing her. \u201cShe\u2019s a charming Southern girl, you know, she\u2019s not impressed. . . . But I would have definitely had to be this cool.\u201d\n\nOctober 2002\n\nJAY-Z releases \u201c\u201903 Bonnie & Clyde,\u201d featuring Beyonc\u00e9.

So that was my rule: Before the age of 25, I would never get married. I feel like you have to get to know yourself, know what you want, spend some time by yourself, and be proud of who you are before you can share that with someone else.\u201d\n\nAugust 2008\n\nJAY-Z finally confirms his marriage to Bey in a September \u201908 Vibe cover story \u2014 and opened up about why they kept it quiet for so long.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous for me to confirm,\u201d he told the mag. \u201cI don\u2019t have \u2026 I\u2019m gonna say, I think that was a ridiculous question. I just think it\u2019s really a part of your life that you gotta keep to yourself \u2026 You have to, or you\u2019ll go insane in this type of business. You have to have something that\u2019s sacred to you and the people around you \u2026 I shared so much of my life, my childhood, and my family, the death of my nephew with the world. I should have something to hold on to. You need something for your sanity to say, \u2018Okay, I could chill out, and this is it.'\u201d\n\nNovember 2008\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 finally talks about her marriage in her December-January 2008 Seventeen cover story.\n\n\u201cI guess probably that we\u2019re all human,\u201d she told the mag of what she\u2019s learned from her relationship. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re picture-perfect on every magazine cover, and you\u2019re the most handsome, successful, coolest guy \u2014 you still get sad, and you still get your feelings hurt, and you still get confused and vulnerable and nervous and scared.

You are so open. You are so overjoyed. There\u2019s no words that can express having a baby growing inside of you, so of course you want to scream it out and tell everyone. [Early into the pregnancy], I flew back to New York to get my check up \u2014 and no heartbeat. Literally the week before I went to the doctor, everything was fine, but there was no heartbeat.\u201d\n\nAugust 2011\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 reveals she is pregnant at the MTV VMAs in L.A., cradling what appeared to be a bump on the red carpet before telling the audience during her \u201cLove on Top\u201d performance, \u201cI want you to stand up on your feet. I want you to feel the love that\u2019s growing inside me.\u201d\n\nOctober 2011\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 andJAY-Z are dogged by an Internet conspiracy that she is not actually pregnant herself and is using a surrogate.\n\nBey addressed the rumors in Life Is But a Dream, calling the reports a \u201cstupid rumor, the most ridiculous rumor I\u2019ve ever heard about me \u2026 To think that I would be that vain\u2026\u201d\n\nJanuary 2012\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z welcome daughter Blue Ivy Carter in New York City on Jan. 7, and the proud parents\u2019 friends and family \u2014 from sister Solange to Gwyneth Paltrow, Rihanna and Russell Simmons \u2014 offer their congratulations on social media.\n\nFebruary 2012\n\nBey and Jay introduce Blue Ivy, sharing the first photos of their daughter on Mom\u2019s Tumblr. \u201cWe welcome you to share in our joy.

Five days later, video footage of Solange seemingly attacking Jay in an elevator at an afterparty leaks online. None of the parties involved have ever spoken out about what caused the altercation, but tabloids reported that Solange was upset with Jay over alleged cheating rumors.\n\nDays after the incident, the trio released a statement: \u201cThere has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family. The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false. At the end of the day families have problems and we\u2019re no different. We love each other and above all we are family. We\u2019ve put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.\u201d\n\nIn an August 2014 Lucky cover story, Solange addressed the incident, calling it \u201cthat thing.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that my family and I are all good,\u201d the singer, 28, told the now-defunct magazine. \u201cWhat we had to say collectively was in the statement that we put out, and we all feel at peace with that.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Splash News\n\nJune 2014\n\nJay and Bey embark on their On the Run Tour, kicking off the 21-date spectacle in Miami on June 25.\n\nSummer 2014\n\nThe couple is plagued by rumors that their marriage is in crisis and they are heading toward a divorce.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nOn Oct. 17, Jay headlines his third annual Tidal x Brooklyn benefit concert, raising money for those affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.
