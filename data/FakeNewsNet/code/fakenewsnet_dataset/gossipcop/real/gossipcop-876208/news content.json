At the time of the alleged snub, Bell shared his disappointment at not being invited with a since-deleted set of tweets, writing, \u201cWhen you\u2019re not invited to the wedding the message is clear\u2026 Loyalty is key\u2026 ALWAYS remember where you came from.\u201d\n\nLater, Peck cooled off a little on the topic, telling PEOPLE, \u201cHe\u2019s been my best friend for 18 years. In all honesty, we talk all the time, we\u2019ve been talking. I was just expecting\u2026\u201d\n\nHe went on to reiterate that there are no hard feelings anymore. \u201cThat\u2019s my bro you know? It\u2019s kind of one of those things where you\u2019re fighting with him on the playground, but if someone else says something, you\u2019re like \u2014 \u2018Hey, I can say that but you can\u2019t!'\u201d\n\nHe even expressed his desire to work with his former costar again. \u201cI would love to [do a reunion],\u201d Bell said. \u201cIf it\u2019s done in the right way. I don\u2019t know if a reunion of us doing same characters as in Drake and Josh, or different ones like in Pineapple Express. But it would definitely be fun.\u201d", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a23_promo_stills_022519.0037_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-485482815.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/pride-gaga2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3200px%2C1680px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-93311558.jpg?crop=0px%2C198px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/r-kelly-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C195px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1028190590.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c94654c862ed2e07d803b3fe49b1e82a?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/gettyimages-1144701016.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/st3-production-still-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1153378737.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1149721273.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-485482815.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/houston-lizzo-mendes-1-2000x1333.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shangri-la_101_0006_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-801525852.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stefani-kimmel-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger-things-inset.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1066711350.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lil-nas-x-young-thug-mason-ramsey-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/taylor-swift-6.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-679944730.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1096044882.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-485482815.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ruth Kinane"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2017/08/27/drake-and-josh-hug-vmas/", "title": "Drake and Josh Reunite with a Hug at VMAs", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Drake and Josh, VMAs, VMAs 2017, MTV VMAs, MTV VMAs 2017,", "news_keywords": "Drake and Josh, VMAs, VMAs 2017, MTV VMAs, MTV VMAs 2017,", "description": "Katy Perry and Taylor Swift most certainly did not make amends with each other during the MTV Video Music Awards\u2026", "og": {"title": "Drake and Josh Reunite with a Hug at VMAs", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/08/27/drake-and-josh-hug-vmas/", "description": "Katy Perry and Taylor Swift most certainly did not make amends with each other during the MTV Video Music Awards\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-485482815.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/08/27/drake-and-josh-hug-vmas/", "description": "Katy Perry and Taylor Swift most certainly did not make amends with each other during the MTV Video Music Awards\u2026", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-485482815.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/08/27/drake-and-josh-hug-vmas/", "title": "Drake and Josh Reunite with a Hug at VMAs", "description": "Katy Perry and Taylor Swift most certainly did not make amends with each other during the MTV Video Music Awards\u2026", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-485482815.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503806400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
