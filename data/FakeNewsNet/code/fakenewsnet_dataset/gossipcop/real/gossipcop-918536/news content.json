She recalled her family's struggle to adjust in an interview with Billboard in February 2017.\n\n\"My parents worked really hard,\" the star said. \"We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again.\"\n\n\"It we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough,\" she added.\n\nCabello came to fame with the girl group Fifth Harmony, and has since pursued a solo career. She will promote her debut studio album, Camila, on the Never Be the Same tour, which kicks off April 9 in Vancouver, B.C.", "images": ["https://www.upi.com/img/expand_gallery.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15071286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4621562907259/2019/upi/24864105aebfdedab071cd61925fb4dc/v1.5/R-Kelly-faces-federal-kidnapping-child-sex-racketeering-charges.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7191562865263/2019/upi/dd7c8c20a88724f042688075dfb2e55c/v1.5/Christine-Baranskis-Good-Fight-moves-from-streaming-to-network.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7061562941093/2019/upi/1cbd640a40d4930c5f604f7bcb58e1de/v1.5/Miley-Cyrus-on-her-unique-and-modern-marriage-Its-so-complex.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/2521520344872/2018/1/4164d57b6b3e289fb4d27b863080fcd5/v1.5/Camila-Cabello-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-her-parents.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4691562947708/2019/upi/93608c5b7949951fad4700562606e8f1/v1.5/Oprah-Winfrey-opens-private-road-to-help-Maui-fire-evacuations.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-hqtKxhsRLFLuJ.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/2521520344872/2018/1/4164d57b6b3e289fb4d27b863080fcd5/Camila-Cabello-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-her-parents.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/related/7641562765490/5/v1.2/7f8c6682524c1c3c702aafae9dbbc65f/upi/On-the-runway-at-Paris-haute-couture-fashion-week.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2211562518286/2019/upi/c81a68a1a9a765aae722442766e0e2c0/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-July-12-Michelle-Rodriguez-Malala-Yousafzai.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/2521520344872/2018/1/4164d57b6b3e289fb4d27b863080fcd5/v1.5/Camila-Cabello-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-her-parents.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2018/03/06/Camila-Cabello-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-her-parents/2521520344872/", "title": "Camila Cabello celebrates 21st birthday with her parents", "meta_data": {"description": "Camila Cabello shared a video of her mom and dad singing an over-the-top rendition of \"Happy Birthday.\"", "keywords": "Entertainment, Music, Camila Cabello", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Music, Camila Cabello", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Camila Cabello shared a video of her mom and dad singing an over-the-top rendition of \"Happy Birthday.\"", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2018/03/06/Camila-Cabello-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-her-parents/2521520344872/", "title": "Camila Cabello celebrates 21st birthday with her parents", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/2521520344872/2018/1/4164d57b6b3e289fb4d27b863080fcd5/v1.5/Camila-Cabello-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-her-parents.jpg", "width": 594, "height": 395}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "creator": "@littlemannie", "title": "Camila Cabello celebrates 21st birthday with her parents", "description": "Camila Cabello shared a video of her mom and dad singing an over-the-top rendition of \"Happy Birthday.\"", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2521520344872/2018/upi/4164d57b6b3e289fb4d27b863080fcd5/v2.1/Camila-Cabello-celebrates-21st-birthday-with-her-parents.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
