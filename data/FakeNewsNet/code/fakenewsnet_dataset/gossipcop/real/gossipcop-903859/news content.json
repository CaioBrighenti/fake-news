Subdural hematomas happen when blood vessels, often veins, burst in this area, forming a collection of blood that presses on the brain, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nWhat causes a subdural hematoma?\n\nWhile this type of brain bleed is occasionally random, a subdural hematoma most often follows a traumatic head injury, such as a fall, collision or accident, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Trebek told fans that his was the result of a fall that occurred a couple months ago.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of a subdural hematoma?\n\nSubdural hematoma symptoms typically include headache, vomiting, drowsiness and eventual loss of consciousness, dizziness, confusion, differing pupil size and slurred speech, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms may appear immediately, but in some cases, they can take weeks or even months to manifest.\n\nHow serious is a subdural hematoma?\n\nThey can be fatal, but a person\u2019s prognosis depends on multiple factors, from the size and severity of the bleed to how quickly treatment is sought, the U.S. National Library of Medicine says. Some subdural hematomas are reversed by drilling a hole in the skull to drain blood and relieve pressure on the brain, while others require more invasive brain surgery. Trebek did not comment on the severity of his case or his treatment plan.\n\nWrite to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com.", "images": ["http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/alex-trebek.jpeg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/alex-trebek.jpeg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jamie Ducharme"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5089680/alex-trebek-brain-surgery-subdural-hematoma/", "title": "Alex Trebek Had Brain Surgery to Treat a Subdural Hematoma.
