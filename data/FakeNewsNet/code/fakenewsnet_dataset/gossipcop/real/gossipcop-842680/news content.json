The promo highlights Rachel, the new lady for the upcoming 13th season of the ABC dating competition.\n\nAlthough the promo mostly consists of old footage, it reminds us of how much the Bachelor Nation loved the lady. Accompanied by %cFifth Harmony%'s \"That's My Girl\", Rachel makes an entrance looking beautiful in a red lace gown. The promo offers the background story of the 31-year-old Dallas attorney during her appearance on \"The Bachelor\". It also includes the \"After the Rose\" special when she met the four contestants.\n\nProducer Mike Fleiss took to Twitter in March to share the first photo of Rachel as the rose-giver. Rachel was seen wearing a sleeveless white patterned gown during the night one of the filming in \"Bachelor\" mansion in Agoura Hills, California. Host %cChris Harrison% was also present in the photo.\n\nIn a previous interview with PEOPLE, Rachel's \"The Bachelorette\" predecessor %cJoJo Fletcher% gave advice to the new leading lady. JoJo said, \"So I think I would just tell her not to overthink every situation and at the end of this whole thing, whatever happens she needs to go with your first instinct or whatever thought you keep coming back to. And it's tough, try not to overthink, really trust yourself, and stay that smart, confident woman that you are. Don\u2019t make these men make you feel any different.\"\n\n\"The Bachelorette\" featuring Rachel Lindsay premieres on May 22 at 8 P.M. on ABC.", "images": ["https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2019/06/28/00138250.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x400/2019/07/12/00138850.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/assets/img/logo.png", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138831.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2019/06/18/00137802.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138863.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138847.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138846.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138836.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138860.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138830.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2019/06/25/00138091.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138845.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138818.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2019/07/02/00138383.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138865.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138834.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138851.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-s-first-promo-is-here.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2019/07/09/00138676.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-s-first-promo-is-here.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00107974.html", "title": "That's Our Girl!
