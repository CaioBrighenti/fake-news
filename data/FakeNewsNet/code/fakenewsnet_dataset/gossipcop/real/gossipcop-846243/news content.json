Here\u2019s his father with breeder Annette Edwards\u2013\n\nEdwards claimed\u2013\n\nSimon had a vet\u2019s check-up three hours before the flight and was fit as a fiddle. Something very strange has happened and I want to know what. I\u2019ve sent rabbits all around the world and nothing like this has happened before.\n\nIn any case, the rabbit had been purchased by a celebrity client, cost $2500 to send to Chicago, and costs $5000/year to care for.\n\nBut he was found dead after a longhaul flight in the cargo hold of a United 767-300. Or perhaps not\u2026\n\nEdwards claims he died on the flight but also states that United told her the rabbit died in a storage room at O\u2019Hare Airport.\n\nUnited is apologetic\u2013\n\nWe were saddened to hear this news. The safety and well-being of all the animals that travel with us is of the utmost importance to United Airlines and our PetSafe team. We have been in contact with our customer and have offered assistance. We are reviewing this matter.\n\nEdwards, a former Playboy model who had plastic surgery to look like Jessica Rabbit from the Roger Rabbit movie, is grieving.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nA couple months ago I wrote a story called Woman Claims United Airlines Killed Her Dog in which I advised against ever checking a pet. I know it is not economical to take a boat across the Atlantic to deliver a rabbit, but this sort of thing happens far too often for comfort. The better solution: identify it as an emotional support animal and keep it in the cabin.\n\nNot to be crass, but I\u2019m also hearing rumors that rabbit stew will be served on Pole-hare-is flights next month out of O\u2019Hare.. We all cope with hare loss differently\u2026", "images":
