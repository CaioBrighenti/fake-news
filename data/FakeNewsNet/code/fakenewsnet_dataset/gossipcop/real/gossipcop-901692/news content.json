{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecy_Goranson", "text": "American actress\n\nAlicia Linda \"Lecy\" Goranson (; born June 22, 1974) is an American actress. She plays the original Becky Conner in the television sitcom Roseanne, which debuted in 1988.[1] She has also had supporting roles in the films How to Make an American Quilt (1996), Boys Don't Cry (1999), and The Extra Man (2010).\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nRoseanne [ edit ]\n\nGoranson studied acting in Chicago and subsequently landed the role of Becky Conner. It was only the second time she auditioned for a part. She played the character for five seasons, exiting the series in 1992, several episodes into the fifth season, to pursue an education at Vassar College.[2] Her schedule permitted her to continue appearing part-time as Becky. Under her new arrangement, the show's producers and writers had to take care to write scenes for Becky sparingly. Goranson's exit resulted in Becky's eloping with her boyfriend. Becky would be seen via the phone briefly on some occasions as she now lived out of state. In the next season, although not at the beginning, the producers decided to bring the character back. Goranson was still unavailable, so Sarah Chalke auditioned and won the role.[3]\n\nChalke played Becky for the remainder of the sixth season and all of the seventh season. When the show reached its eighth season, Goranson managed to schedule things so that she could work as Becky again, replacing Chalke. Goranson appeared continually at the beginning of season eight, but by mid-season she had scheduling conflicts again with school. On two occasions Goranson had to pull out of episodes in which the Becky character was necessary; Darlene's wedding and a family trip to Walt Disney World. Chalke was called back in to play Becky for these episodes. Toward the end of the season, Goranson was available again and she returned to play Becky. However, after the end of the eighth season, Goranson decided not to continue due to scheduling conflicts she had during the previous season. For the ninth and what would be the final season of the original run, Goranson did not return to the show, leaving the role to Chalke for that season.\n\nThe appearances by Goranson vs. Chalke became a running gag. Goranson's first re-appearance was marked with a \"Where the hell have you been?\" from several cast members while in character. Similarly, Chalke's infrequent appearances during Season 8 would be played for humor with an \"Aren't you glad you're here this week?\" from Roseanne. There was even a glimpse into the future where a grown-up and somewhat catatonic DJ, played by John Goodman instead of Michael Fishman, repeatedly uttered to a psychiatrist \"They say she's the same but she isn't the same\"; at the end of the episode, it was revealed to the audience that he was referring to the two actresses playing Becky.\n\nPost-Roseanne [ edit ]\n\nAfter the initial run of Roseanne, Goranson had several small roles in films and has guest starred in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, Sex and the City, Damages and Fringe. In her film roles as an adult, she is normally credited as Alicia rather than Lecy Goranson. She is currently living in a section of Brooklyn, New York. She played the part of Sandra in The Extra Man which opened in limited release on July 30, 2010.\n\nRoseanne revival and The Conners [ edit ]\n\nOn April 28, 2017 it was announced that a revival of Roseanne was in the works with most of the original cast and some of the original producers slated to return.[4] In May 2017, it was confirmed that Goranson would be returning in the role of Becky. Chalke would also appear, playing a different role. The revival of Roseanne premiered on March 27, 2018 on ABC. [5][6][7] On May 29, 2018, in the wake of controversial remarks made by Roseanne Barr on Twitter regarding Valerie Jarrett (an advisor of former president Barack Obama), ABC cancelled the revival after a single season.[8][9][10]\n\nOn June 21, 2018, ABC announced a spin-off from Roseanne, entitled The Conners, with all the original cast of Roseanne to return, except for Barr herself.[11] The new show premiered on October 16, 2018.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nGoranson is the daughter of Stephen Goranson, an official who works for the Environmental Protection Agency, and Linda Goranson, an English teacher at Evanston Township High School. She has an older brother named Adam.
