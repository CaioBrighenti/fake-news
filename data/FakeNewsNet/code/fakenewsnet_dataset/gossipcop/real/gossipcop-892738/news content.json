Pfeiffer has been vocal about her break from work before, but in a new Today interview on Thursday, she further explained her return, saying that at one point she became fully \"unhireable\" when she was trying to balance the demands of acting with being a mother to her two children.\n\nImage zoom Ian West/PA Images via Getty Images\n\n\"The older the kids got, it became more and more difficult to say 'yes.' I became pickier and pickier: 'Well, where does it shoot? When does it shoot? How long will I be away?'\" Pfeiffer said. \"And at some point, I became unhireable. That was really the real reason why I hadn't worked.\"\n\nVIDEO: Michelle Pfeiffer Turned Down a Role in Thelma & Louise\n\nBoth her kids are now in their early 20s, and as they grew up and started applying to colleges, Pfeiffer felt more equipped to take on acting projects without any fear or worry.\n\nRELATED: Michelle Pfeiffer Reveals Every Woman She's Talked to Has Been Sexually Harassed\n\n\"It feels really good, because I don't feel that guilt anymore, [that] working moms feel\u2014you can relate. No matter what profession you're in there's that tug,\" she said. \"It doesn't even matter if you're not a working mom\u2014if you're out doing something with your friends, you sort of feel this guilt that you should always be with them. I am relieved of that, so in some ways it's more fun.\"\n\nWe are so happy to see her back in action on our TV and movie screens.
