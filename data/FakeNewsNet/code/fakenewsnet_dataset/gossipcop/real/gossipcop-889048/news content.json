That seemed weird.\u2019 And that\u2019s how I dismissed it. I was like, \u2018Well, this isn\u2019t a thing. Like, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Buck up, Faris. Like, just giggle.\u2019 But it made me feel small. He wouldn\u2019t have done that to the lead male.\u201d\n\nFaris was joined by guest Arielle Kebbel (UnREAL, Ballers) to discuss the growing issues of sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace and how men can help fix the problems.\n\nImage zoom Karwai Tang/WireImage\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re conditioned to giggle,\u201d says Faris. \u201cBut also, if we were to do anything else, we\u2019d be labeled a bitch or difficult. That would be the best of circumstances. I guess what I do is I laugh. It puts everyone at ease. That\u2019s the defense mode you go into.\u201d\n\nFaris, whose book, Unqualified, is out today, later brought the conversation back to her uncomfortable on-set experience. This time revealing how she purportedly landed the role.\n\n\u201cI remember that same director telling my agent, who told me, that I had great legs and that was one of the reasons that I got hired,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd listen, that\u2019s a f\u2014ing great compliment. I like my legs. But that sort of informed my whole experience with that whole project. I don\u2019t think the male lead got hired because he had great legs. Therefore I felt like I\u2019m hired because of these elements \u2014 not because of [talent].\u201d\n\nFaris\u2019 comments arrive in the wake of women speaking out in light of the sexual misconduct allegations against disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. In the wake of the Weinstein scandal, numerous other men in Hollywood have been accused of sexual misconduct, including director James Toback and Nickelodeon producer Chris Savino.", "images":
