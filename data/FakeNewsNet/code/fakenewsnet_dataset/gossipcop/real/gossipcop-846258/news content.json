The biggest difference is that each episode will be less than 10 minutes long and will live on Quibi, an upcoming mobile-first video streaming service. The show has been picked up for 20 mini-episodes, though there is still no word on who will host the show.\n\n\n\nAs we celebrate in millennial glory over the news, we\u2019re also remembering some of our favorite episodes: There\u2019s that time Justin Timberlake cried thinking his house and valuables had been repossessed, that moment Beyonc\u00e9 believed she ruined Christmas for young fans, that episode when Wilmer Valderrama\u2019s SUV got destroyed, that time Demi Lovato thought her recording studio was haunted and that segment when Taylor Swift believed she ruined a couple\u2019s wedding.\n\nBut there was also one episode where Kutcher pranked multiple A-List Latina celebs. The actor-producer started his fourth season by pranking both Salma Hayek and Eva Longoria in hilarious tricks that had both superstars shook.\n\n\n\nThe first victim of Kutcher\u2019s mischief was Hayek. During a dinner with fellow actress Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, who was in on the joke, the Mexican star was publicly embarrassed by a shitty \u2014 literally! \u2014 encounter.\n\nPunk\u2019d / MTV\n\nDuring the gag, Cruz excuses herself from the table to use the restroom. When she gets there, she spots a colossal turd in the toilet, and calls Hayek over to see the unbelievable (and fake!) offering a patron left.\n\n\u201cHow could you bring me to look at this? I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t,\u201d Hayek says, laughing while visibly terrified.\n\nPunk\u2019d / MTV\n\nWhen someone, who\u2019s also in on the prank, comes to use the bathroom, Hayek warns them not to. At this point, Cruz flushes the toilet and the doo-doo water overflows. The girls literally run away to their table, where they soon experience a mortifying scene: the woman who saw them in the restroom publicly, and loudly, accuses them of making the fecal mess. Soon, the manager and busboy, who refuses to clean up the excrement, are at their table blaming Hayek for everything.\n\nPunk\u2019d / MTV\n\n\u201cI am very mortified because they are staring at us like you\u2019re blaming it on us, and this is very, very disturbing,\u201d Hayek tells the faux-manager angrily. Just before she breaks, Kutcher runs out to her table, where the actress learns her gal Cruz and Kutcher Punk\u2019d her.\n\n\u201cWhat a nightmare,\u201d she says, before fake-strangling Cruz and turning to the camera to say \u201cI\u2019ve been Punk\u2019d.\u201d\n\nPunk\u2019d / MTV\n\nNext up is Longoria. During her segment, the former Desperate Housewives actress is leaving the set with co-star Jesse Metcalfe, who\u2019s in on the joke. She joins him in his SUV, which is quickly pulled over by the cops. Jesse, who played Longoria\u2019s teenage gardener and sidepiece on the show, is hesitant to stop his car. When the policeman rushes behind him, he eventually breaks but then runs out of the car. Longoria is stunned.\n\nPunk\u2019d / MTV\n\n\u201cHey, oh my God! Hello,\u201d she yells, with her hand covering her mouth in disbelief. Soon a fake cop pulls up beside her asking her to put her hands out of the car window and slowly get out of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cI am so scared right now,\u201d she says, before going through questioning, where she learns that Metcalfe might have another identity. She\u2019s not clear on what her pal might be involved in, but it looks certain, to her, that it\u2019s illegal and that she now is implicated in it.\n\nPunk\u2019d / MTV\n\nMoments later, she sees Metcalfe arrested and put in the back of a police car. She is told that she, too, will have to go to the station. Nearly crying, Kutcher pulls up behind Longoria, who laughs instantly knowing she\u2019s been Punk\u2019d.\n\n\n\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d she tells the host, adding \u201cI was fucking freaking out, man. Dude, I\u2019m sweating my ass off\u201d before looking to the camera to say she\u2019s the latest victim of the prank show.\n\nPunk\u2019d / MTV\n\nThere\u2019s no word yet on when the reboot will make its way to Quibi, but after watching some of our fave Latinx stars targeted by Kutcher\u2019s stunts, we\u2019re thirsty for more.\n\n\n\nCatch the whole episode, which also includes a trick against R&B singer Mario, here.\n\n\n\nRead: Here\u2019s How Aubrey Plaza Went From A Prankster In High School To A Major Actress In Hollywood\n\n", "images": ["https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/asg_M7sEAMEXLsFR3qws2Fart_vYYRnp8NzSmRNGEc2F1562166203946-ScreenShot2019-07-03at11.01.09AM.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/salmaevapunkd-4.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/salmaevapunkd-7.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/salmaevapunkd-5.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/salmaevapunkd-6.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/salmaevapunkd-1.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27113909/Cookie-1-650x128.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20128'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2018-03-05-at-1.27.11-PM-740x457.jpg", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27114023/Cookie-2-650x115.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20205'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://wearemitu.com/wp-content/themes/wam2019/assets/logo_black.svg", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/asg_M7sEAMEXLsFR3qws2Fart_vYYRnp8NzSmRNGEc2F1562165847266-ScreenShot2019-07-03at10.52.00AM.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/evalongoriababy-800x420.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20115'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/salmaevapunkd-3.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/asg_M7sEAMEXLsFR3qws2Fart_vYYRnp8NzSmRNGEc2F1562166448843-ScreenShot2019-07-03at11.07.18AM.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20740%20457'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20420'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KNDAJyf-PrtnR.gif", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/salmaevapunkd-2.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20762%20450'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/asg_M7sEAMEXLsFR3qws2Fart_vYYRnp8NzSmRNGEc2F1562158648284-ScreenShot2019-07-03at8.56.37AM.png", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27115606/Eva-Cookie-Slap-1.jpg", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27114115/Cookie-3-650x205.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=981841528666204&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/27115606/Eva-Cookie-Slap-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Santiago"], "canonical_link": "https://wearemitu.com/entertainment/eva-longorias-new-character-on-empire-slaps-someone-could-it-be-cookie-because-run-girl/", "title": "we are mit\u00fa", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Eva Longoria plays joins Empire.", "google-site-verification": "txV3hel1GYO9nQTXXOwRuR0__WiyZxGVAN2FnhZSwpA", "msvalidate.01": "FFAE49C8BE9770CC6266A99C4C002B05", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/22184316/mitu-favicon.png", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "we are mit\u00fa", "title": "We're All Waiting With A Tub Of Popcorn To See If Eva Longoria's And Taraji P.
