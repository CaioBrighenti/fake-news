Sunday, February 12, marks the 59th annual Grammy Awards, so if you\u2019re looking to celebrate Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade album and Adele\u2019s earth-shattering comeback, you better tune in. While the Grammys are known for epic musical performances and the occasional collaboration, the red carpet has had its fair share of, um, daring looks. Love them or hate them, many outfits that graced the Grammys\u2019 red carpets have gone down in history.\n\n1. Lady Gaga in an egg, 2011\n\nWhat came first: the Gaga or the egg? In case you missed it back in 2011, Gaga laid in an enclosed, translucent egg while her minimalist entourage trotted her down the red carpet. Oh, and she and the egg were being lifted for the entire duration of the red carpet. Eventually, Gaga\u2019s egg hatched, revealing a less-anticipated look. The whole thing sounds bizarre; however, she redefined what it means to make a grand entrance.\n\n2. Rihanna in Giambattista Valli, 2015\n\nTired of seeing the same sequined column dress every awards season? So are we, which is why we\u2019re particularly fond of Rihanna. The industry heavyweight loves fashion \u2014 she even has her own clothing line with Puma \u2014 and is never afraid to take a risk. While she\u2019s sported a lot of exceptional looks in her sartorial heyday, our favorite has to be the pink Giambattista Valli gown she wore in 2015.\n\nAt The Cheat Sheet, we believe in dressing for yourself and having fun with what you wear \u2014 life\u2019s too short to wear the same cleavage-baring dress time after time. Not only was this dress unapologetically feminine, but you could also tell Rihanna felt great wearing it. Later that year, Vanity Fair highlights an equally extravagant ensemble she wore to the Met Ball \u2014 and we\u2019re hoping there are many more jaw-dropping looks underway.\n\n3. Pharrell Williams in a Vivienne Westwood hat, 2014\n\nBefore Pharrell, we thought we\u2019d seen just about every lavish men\u2019s trend on the Grammys\u2019 red carpet. As the years went by, patterns and sparkles became more predictable than risky. Then, in 2014, Pharrell arrived wearing an oversized mountain hat from Vivienne Westwood. The hat itself received a lot of attention, both good and bad, and quickly became a career-defining look for the \u201cHappy\u201d singer. Let this be a lesson that one accessory can change your life in ways you\u2019d never imagine. Hyperbolic? Slightly, but you get the message.\n\n4. Michael Jackson, 1984\n\nSpeaking of male style trailblazers, it\u2019d be criminal to not talk about Michael Jackson. While the late singer is remembered most for his silky smooth voice and catchy tunes, Jackson sported countless infamous looks over the course of his life. Case in point: The glitzy number he wore to the 1984 ceremony.\n\nNowadays, there\u2019s nothing earth-shattering about a guy wearing a sparkling suit to the Grammys, but Jackson was ahead of his time. Everything from the military-inspired jacket to the single glove was so eccentric and uniquely Jackson that it will forever go down in history.\n\n5. Adele in Giorgio Armani, 2012\n\nIn a world where virtually every celebrity tries to wear the most original, over-the-top look on the carpet, there\u2019s something really comforting about Adele\u2019s style. For as long as we can remember, she\u2019s sported different iterations of a slim, black dress \u2014 but it works. The crooner keeps her life private and is only looking to top the charts, not tabloid headlines.\n\nWe\u2019re not surprised she doesn\u2019t strive to up the sartorial ante every season. Instead, she sticks with what she feels confident in. This Giorgio Armani dress was the start of many great, albeit predictable, looks \u2014 and we\u2019re a big fan of the red lip.\n\n6. Lady Gaga in Armani Priv\u00e9, 2010\n\nBetween the infamous meat dress and aforementioned egg ensemble, Lady Gaga has sported some of the most polarizing looks in Grammys history. But this one, courtesy of Armani Priv\u00e9, was different. A modern day princess look, this dress embraced Gaga\u2019s loud style but was surprisingly wearable. Paired with ombr\u00e9 yellow hair, platform shoes, and a incredibly sharp death star, it was the perfect balance of eclectic and exceptional.\n\n7. Madonna in Givenchy, 2015\n\nMadonna\u2019s extensive career has been chock-full of memorable looks. While we don\u2019t think Madge\u2019s Givenchy matador attire will become as infamous as the cone bra, it did turn heads. If you ask us, this ensemble seemed like a desperately plea to reclaim her title as the music industry\u2019s fashion darling \u2014 especially since she flashed some of the carpet\u2019s spectators, according to Us Weekly \u2014 but it aligned nicely with Madonna\u2019s off-the-cuff fashion choices. Sure, it\u2019s costumey, but the Grammys are a better time than any to really push the envelope.\n\n8. M.I.A. in Henry Holland, 2009\n\nGetting dressed for an awards show must be hard enough. But while pregnant? Forget about it. Though a very pregnant M.I.A. sported a comfortable, flowing dress and sneakers on the red carpet, the expecting rapper performed wearing a revealing polka dot outfit. This look isn\u2019t the first one that comes to mind when reviewing the best of the Grammys, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ll never forget. Love it or hate it, we applaud the \u201cPaper Planes\u201d artist for wearing something more elevated than sweats during her final trimester, let alone performing.\n\n9. Nick Minaj in Atelier Versace, 2012\n\nLike the divas before her \u2014 Gaga and Madonna come to mind \u2014 Nicki Minaj doesn\u2019t shy away from a fashion risk. The rapper has worn everything from head-to-toe leopard to bubblegum pink hair, but perhaps her most questionable look was the Atelier Versace getup she wore on the 2012 carpet. Not only did her dress look like that of a colonial woman\u2019s, her red carpet sidekick was dressed as a priest. This look channeled The Exorcist \u2014 not necessarily in a good way. But still, it was memorable.\n\n10. Alicia Keys in Christian Dior, 2002\n\n\u201cOut of the box is my theme tonight,\u201d Alicia Keys once said of her look, according to InStyle. And we can\u2019t help but agree. All told, this look has all the necessary ingredients to be Grammys red carpet gold. Though we\u2019re talking about America\u2019s most important awards ceremony for musicians, honorees are not expected to dress to the nines. Opting for jeans and a white tank top was risky, though incredibly rock and roll, but we love how she balanced out the casual foundation with a beautiful headpiece and sheer draping. Paired with sparkly eye shadow, this look was glamorous, daring, and surprisingly relaxed.\n\n11. Christina Aguilera in Trish Summerville, 2001\n\nA simple Google search will show you Christina Aguilera has had many style transformations; however, there\u2019s no period as memorable and uniquely Aguilera as her \u201cDirty\u201d phase. During this time, the singer boasted platinum blonde hair with dark streaks, the occasional dreadlocks, and revealing looks, like this one from designer Trish Summerville. In a simpler time, this ensemble raised a lot of eyebrows for being too risqu\u00e9, but it\u2019s 2017. We\u2019ve seen a lot worse.\n\n12. Jennifer Lopez in Versace, 2000\n\nOf course, no roundup would be complete without paying homage to Jennifer Lopez and that green Versace dress. While this dress was a big deal for 2000, it over time became synonymous with the Grammys\u2019 red carpet. It\u2019s loud, revealing, and thought-provoking. Yes, the down-to-there neckline and bare back are revealing, but we like how they were paired with a long hem and sleeves. She brought back the look years later, but nothing\u2019s better than the original.\n\nFollow Kelsey on Twitter @Kmulvs and Instagram @Kmulvs", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/US-singer-Alicia-Keys.jpg?x46112", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pop-diva-Christina-Aguilera.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jennifer-Lopez-and-Sean-Puffy-Combs.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/An-egg-like-container-with-singer-Lady-Gaga-inside.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Recording-artist-Pharrell-Williams.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/A-doll-of-the-entertainer-Michael-Jackson.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Singer-Adele.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Singer-Lady-Gaga.jpg?x46112", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Singer-Nicki-Minaj.jpg?x46112", "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/An-egg-like-container-with-singer-Lady-Gaga-inside.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Singer-M.I.A.-Maya-Arulpragasam-L-and-Ben-Brewer.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Singer-Rihanna.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Singer-Madonna.jpg?x46112"], "top_img": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/An-egg-like-container-with-singer-Lady-Gaga-inside.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelsey Mulvey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/gear-style/most-memorable-grammy-looks-of-all-time.html/", "title": "12 of the Most Memorable Grammy Looks of All Time", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/gear-style/most-memorable-grammy-looks-of-all-time.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Many musicians take the Grammys as an opportunity to show off their best (and most outrageous) fashion choices.
