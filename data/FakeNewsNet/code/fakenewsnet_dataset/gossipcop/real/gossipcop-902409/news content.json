And she did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you times infinity,\u201d Lourd concluded.\n\nIn September, she told Ellen DeGeneres that life has been \u201csurreal\u201d since the loss of her mother and grandmother Debbie Reynolds, who died one day later.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to really explain it, and it\u2019s so hard to talk about,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I say that I\u2019m doing good, I\u2019m too happy, and if I say that I\u2019m not doing good, then I\u2019m a mess, so it\u2019s really hard to know what to say about it because it really is so surreal and impossible to deal with.\u201d\n\nMark Hamill also paid his respects to his longtime friend and \u201cStar Wars\u201d co-star via social media on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s ever really gone\u2026\u201d he posted along with photos of the two of them.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-497200576.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/d29ea10c24a74df597d0ccaa32076ecd/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-497200576.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["December"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/12/27/billie-lourd-to-carrie-fisher-one-year-after-death-i-love-you-times-infinity/", "title": "Billie Lourd to Carrie Fisher one year after death: \u2018I love you times infinity\u2019", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2019 NYP Holdings.
