And I\u2019m grateful for the words they said on the panel the other day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to be grateful for the opportunity and respectful of the colleagues and the people that I work with, and maintain a steadfast sense of your self-worth,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso Read: 'Hawaii Five-0': CBS Execs Maintain They Offered Daniel Dae Kim, Grace Park 'a Lot of Money' to Stay\n\nKim made headlines last month when he and co-star Grace Park exited the CBS police drama, raising questions about the pay disparity between them and their white counterparts, Scott Caan and Alex O\u2019Loughlin.\n\nShortly after his exit was announced, Kim wrote a post on Facebook confirming that he and CBS \u201cweren\u2019t able to agree to terms on a new contract.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Hawaii Five-0' Adds Three Cast Members After Fallout Over Recent Exits\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll end by saying that though transitions can be difficult, I encourage us all to look beyond the disappointment of this moment to the bigger picture,\u201d the post read. \u201cThe path to equality is rarely easy. But I hope you can be excited for the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d showrunner Peter Lenkov later said Kim and Park turned down \u201cunprecedented raises\u201d in leaving the show, which CBS executive Kelly Kahl echoed at the network\u2019s presentation last week.\n\n\u201cWe love both those actors and did not want to lose them. We made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around. We wanted them to stick around \u2026 We tried our darndest to keep them.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Hawaii Five-0': President of Leading Asian-Focused U.S. Cable Channel Slams CBS Over Cast Exits\n\n\u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d launched in September 2010 and is a reboot of the original series that signed off in 1980 after 12 seasons.
