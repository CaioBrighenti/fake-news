Teri didn\u2019t. There was no bad blood, I think that was just the way it was.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Teri Hatcher Is Desperate For A \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Revival\n\nDuring the same interview, Longoria also denied that her friendship with former \u201cHousewives\u201d co-star Nicollette Sheridan was impacted when she sued series creator Marc Cherry in a high-profile wrongful-termination lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe were pretty removed from the court case,\u201d added Longoria. \u201cBut Nicollette is great, she is a great girl. She\u2019s just a fun girl to hang out with.\u201d", "images": ["https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/149178_1844.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10332590b_huge.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/gettyimages-1138920604.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C254px%2C2466px%2C1650px&resize=145%2C97", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/383/787/ETC071219RKellyMoreChargesJacobHoggardPreliminaryHearingDay2ONLINES.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/558/587/GLOB0055739960000011_1_thumbnail_711x400_1570397251897.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/384/763/ETC071219SethRogenBillyEichnerTheLionKingONLINE.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10333493g_huge.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/384/263/ETC071219SwordOfTrustCast2019SXSWONLINES.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/c03-chris-crippin-in-studio.png?w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/et.png?w=90", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10216925bv_huge.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/417/471/ETC171219EDSHEERANNEWMUSIConlines.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/et.png?w=82", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_9970434y_huge-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mccain.png?w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/4086b526c42e4ccfd087129943b18bc3.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/20577679.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C49px%2C2476px%2C1657px&resize=145%2C97"], "top_img": "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/149178_1844.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brent Furdyk"], "canonical_link": "http://etcanada.com/news/317711/eva-longoria-is-still-friends-with-her-desperate-housewives-co-stars-with-one-exception/", "title": "Eva Longoria Is Still Friends With Her \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Co-Stars \u2014 With One Exception", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Eva Longoria Is Still Friends With Her \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Co-Stars \u2014\u00a0With One\u00a0Exception", "author": "Brent Furdyk", "description": "Rumours of friction among the cast of \"Desperate Housewives\" were rampant throughout the series' eight-season run, and according to one of the show's stars, those rumours\u00a0had a bit of truth to them.
