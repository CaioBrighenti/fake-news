When Porsha confronted NeNe about saying that she should be fired during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen at the end of April, NeNe was not having any of it, which prompted Porsha to call her out for seeming to not own up to her comments.\n\nNeNe still denied making that statement on WWHL when she returned to the Clubhouse to dish on the RHOA season premiere on Sunday night. Even though it may have seemed like NeNe did feel that way about Porsha, she explains why that's not exactly what she said in the video, above.\n\nSo is NeNe or Porsha right in this argument? For what it's worth, about 64 percent of the WWHL audience said they were on NeNe's side in her disagreement with Porsha.\n\nWatch NeNe give her shade-filled take on some of the other things the RHOA ladies have said about her so far this season, below.", "images":
