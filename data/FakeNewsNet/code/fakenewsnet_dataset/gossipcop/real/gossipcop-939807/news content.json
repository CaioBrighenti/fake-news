You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been known for months now that Grimes is going, the furore surrounding his exit has overshadowed one of the most important questions of all: why exactly is Andrew Lincoln leaving?\n\nNews first surfaced of Lincoln\u2019s departure in May, with Collider reporting that his character - along with Lauren Cohan\u2019s Maggie Rhee - was to be phased out of the show during its current ninth season.\n\nLincoln confirmed the news three months later, showing up to Comic-Con in San Diego to say goodbye to the show\u2019s most dedicated fans. This is what he had to say:\n\n\u201cThis will be my last season playing the role of Rick Grimes. It means everything to me. I love the people who make this show. I\u2019m particularly fond of the people who watch this show. My relationship with Mr Rick Grimes is far from over.\u201d\n\nThe British actor explained that his decision stemmed from wanting to spend more time with his family back in the UK, having been forced to continually relocate to Georgia for filming since the show began.\n\nSpeaking to EW Radio, he said: \u201cI have two young children, and I live in a different country, and they become less portable as they get older. It was that simple. It was time for me to come home.\u201d\n\nOther sources, however, have suggested that Lincoln\u2019s decision to leave runs deeper \u2013 and may have been a consequence of former showrunner Scott Gimple unexpectedly writing his on-screen son Chandler Riggs out of the show during its eighth season.\n\nTom Payne, who plays Jesus, told Digital Spy: \u201cI think when Carl died last year and Chandler left, I think that was a moment for him of: \u2018OK, where does this leave Rick? And how does he move forward?\u2019 I think that was a pause for thought.\u201d\n\nRiggs refuted this, however, while speaking to Metro, revealing that Lincoln had been planning to quit for some time.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I heard [the news], I honestly wasn\u2019t too surprised because we talked about him leaving for a while. He had brainstormed a lot of really cool ideas behind it.\n\n\u201cHe misses his family,\u201d Riggs continued. \u201cHe leaves every single year for like seven months to go do this show. After a while, you want to raise your kids and spend time with your wife. It was definitely really hard on him and I\u2019m super, super happy for him to be able to raise his family, and do more cool things that he\u2019d always talked about doing that he was never really able to do.\u201d\n\nPayne stated he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Lincoln was simply tired of being put through the emotional ringer. Across its nine seasons, the character has lost his closest friends and family in traumatic ways and has faced constant distress.\n\n\u201cIf you look at all of the work that Andy\u2019s done \u2013 [he] has been in floods of tears, with snot hanging out of his nose, and he\u2019s exhausted and covered in blood. Psychologically and physically, that\u2019s got to take its toll on you.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The 25 best TV shows on Netflix UK 1/25 Bojack Horseman A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development\u2026 on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams \u201cmust watch\u201d. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack \u2013 one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin\u2019 Around \u2013 as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. Almost as good are a support cast including Alison Brie (Glow, Mad Men), Aaron Paul, of Breaking Bad, and Amy Sedaris as a pampered Persian cat who is also BoJack\u2019s agent. Season five touches the live rail of harassment in the movie industry, offering one of the most astute commentaries yet on the #MeToo movement with an episode based centred around an awards ceremony called \u201cThe Forgivies\u201d. Netflix 2/25 Stranger Things A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb \u2013 the \u201cbest friend\u201d character eaten in the second episode \u2013 went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix 3/25 Daredevil Netflix\u2019s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox\u2019s blind lawyer/crimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck's turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York\u2019s Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D'Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Netflix 4/25 The Staircase Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson \u2013 charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife \u2013 the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It\u2019s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Netflix 5/25 Dark Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix\u2019s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it\u2019s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it\u2019s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. Netflix 6/25 A Series of Unfortunate Events The wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let\u2019s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). Netflix 7/25 Maniac If you\u2019re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It\u2019s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a \u201ctravel buddy\u201d sit down and read you adverts. Stone and Hill are star-crossed outcasts participating in a drugs trial that catapults them into a series of trippy genre excursions \u2013 including an occult adventure and a Lord of the Rings-style fantasy. It is here that Fukunaga demonstrates his versatility, handling potentially hokey material smartly and respectfully. 007 fans can sleep easy. Netflix 8/25 Better Call Saul The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord\u2019s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? AMC Studios/Netflix 9/25 Black Mirror Don\u2019t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker\u2019s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash \u2013 yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story \"San Junipero\" and Star Trek parody \"USS Callister\", which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. Netflix 10/25 Mindhunter David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It\u2019s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders \u2013 including the notorious \u201cCo-Ed\u201d butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. Netflix 11/25 The Crown A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost / Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. Most impressive of all, arguably, is Claire Foy, who plays the Queen as a shy woman thrust unwillingly into the spotlight. Foy and the rest of the principal cast have now departed, with a crew of older actors \u2013 headed by Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies \u2013 taking over as the middle-aged Windsors for season three. Netflix 12/25 Narcos This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino\u2019s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix\u2019s biggest hits \u2013 the company doesn\u2019t release audience figures \u2013 the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico\u2019s interminable drugs wars. Juan Pablo Gutierrez/Netflix 13/25 Master Of None A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari\u2019s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. K.C. Bailey / Netflix 14/25 Bloodline One of Netflix\u2019s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan\u2019s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling \u2013 a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn\u2019t feel all that guilty about. Rod Millington/Netflix 15/25 The Alienist You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We\u2019re firmly in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Br\u00fchl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Kurt Iswarienko 16/25 Love Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs\u2019s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms \u2013 but Love\u2019s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there\u2019s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Netflix 17/25 Queer Eye Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs \u2013 but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. Netflix 18/25 Chef\u2019s Table A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef; across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. Charles Panian/Netflix 19/25 Arrested Development A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman \u201cmansplained\u201d away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix\u2019s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix 20/25 Altered Carbon Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new \u201cskins\u201d. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix\u2019s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel\u2019s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs. Netflix 21/25 Rick and Morty Dan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFly/Doc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon. Netflix/Adult Swim 22/25 GLOW Mad Men\u2019s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda \u201cBritannica\u201d Richardson. Netflix 23/25 Archer Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings. 24/25 Ozark Breaking Bad for those with short attention spans. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero\u2019s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family. Netflix 25/25 The Good Place A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto). Netflix 1/25 Bojack Horseman A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development\u2026 on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams \u201cmust watch\u201d. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise.

Netflix\n\nThe ending of last week\u2019s episode saw Rick impaled on a spike and surrounded by walkers. Any concerns that this was Rick\u2019s demise, however, were dispelled when AMC released a new trailer showing Rick out of his terrifying predicament.\n\nAndrew Lincoln can stride away from The Walking Dead knowing he\u2019s left his imprint on television. As Rick Grimes, he\u2019s portrayed one of the small screen\u2019s most interesting heroes who, like Walter White and Don Draper, toed the line between hero and villainy with an intrigue most actors would struggle to convey.\n\nThe good news is that the character will return in three feature-length TV movies that have been announced by franchise overseer Scott Gimple - the first project heralding a series of new scripted projects that\u2019ll focus on other characters within the universe\n\nThe Walking Dead continues in the US on AMC every Sunday with the simulcast airing in the UK at 2am. The episode is also available to watch on NOW TV ahead of its repeat on FOX at 9pm the following evening", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/15/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/15/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-season-9-episode-5-rick-grimes-leaving-andrew-lincoln-why-quit-a8612766.html", "title": "The Walking Dead season 9: The reason why Rick Grimes actor Andrew Lincoln quit the series", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-season-9-episode-5-rick-grimes-leaving-andrew-lincoln-why-quit-a8612766.html", "title": "The reason why Andrew Lincoln quit The Walking Dead", "description": "The actor has played the lead character since its first episode 2010 \u2013 but what inspired his decision to leave?", "updated_time": "2018-11-06T09:13:23+00:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/15/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "video": {"identifier": "https://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/624246174001/624246174001_5854695657001_5854691432001.mp4?pubId=624246174001&videoId=5854691432001", "type": "application/octet-stream"}}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/8612766"}, "description": "Andrew Lincoln\u00a0has officially left\u00a0The Walking Dead \u2013 but will return as Rick Grimes in a trilogy of films.", "keywords": "The Walking Dead, Andrew Lincoln, Rick Grimes, News, TV & Radio, Culture", "fb": {"pages": 13312631635, "admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "article": {"tag": "The Walking Dead", "published_time": "2018-11-05T07:13:00Z", "modified_time": "2018-11-06T09:13:23+00:00", "section": "News", "subsection": "Video", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 838, "image_count": 3, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 10, "external_link_count": 4}, "twitter": {"title": "The reason why Andrew Lincoln quit The Walking Dead", "description": "Andrew Lincoln\u00a0has officially left\u00a0The Walking Dead \u2013 but will return as Rick Grimes in a trilogy of films.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Independent"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541401980.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
