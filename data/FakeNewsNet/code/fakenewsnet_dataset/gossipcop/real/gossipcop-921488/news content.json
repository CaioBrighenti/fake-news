VOLTA is based on extreme sports.\n\nArnaud described himself on social media as being trained in high-flying circus acts, including the \u201csolo single ring spin\u201d and \u201cSwiss rings.\u201d\n\nHe had at least two daughters, including one born in August 2015 to wife and model Inna D Gorelova, according to his social media accounts.\n\nArnaud worked various shows in several hotels before joining VOLTA\u2019s cast full-time in 2016.\n\nThis is not the first time a member of the circus troupe \u2014 known for its death-defying stunts, which are performed largely without safety nets \u2014 has died on stage.\n\nIn 2013, Sarah Guyard-Guillot, who was also from France, fell almost 100 feet to her death when her safety net failed during a performance of \u201cKa\u201d at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\nThe company was fined more than $25,000 for safety violations \u2014 including for providing inadequate equipment training for the mother-of-two \u2014 by the state of Nevada.\n\nIn 2016, the 43-year-old son of one of the company\u2019s founders also was killed while setting up a telescopic lift in a show in San Francisco.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/d29ea10c24a74df597d0ccaa32076ecd/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/yann3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/yann3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["March"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/03/18/cirque-du-soleil-aerialist-dies-after-fall-during-show/", "title": "Cirque du Soleil aerialist dies after fall during show", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2019 NYP Holdings.
