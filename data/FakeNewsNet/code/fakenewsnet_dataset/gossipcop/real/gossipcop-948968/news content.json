The 34-year-old \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d alum confirmed her engagement to Foster, 68, on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe did it at the top of this mountain in Anacapri [Italy]. Totally dark only stars,\u201d she revealed in a text exchange (via Instagram) with Just Jared\u2019s Jared Eng, before joking: \u201cThankfully he didn\u2019t push me off the cliff. He said it was one or the other. And in the end he spared me.\u201d\n\nFollowing news of the engagement, Foster\u2019s daughters took to social media, where Erin, 35, jokingly called her future stepmom \u201cMommyyyy.\u201d Sara, 37, also wrote, \u201cOut of the country. What did I miss?\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Erin and Sara have played around with Foster and McPhee\u2019s relationship status. In September, Sara posted, \u201cExcited about my new step mom\u201d on her Instagram story.\n\nThe siblings also believed Foster would find wife No. 5 long before he popped the question to McPhee.\n\n\u201cWe love when he is married, in a relationship. He is at his happiest when he is in a relationship,\u201d Erin said in 2016. \u201cHe will definitely get married again. He loves being married. Lucky No. 5!\u201d\n\nFoster split from first wife B.J. Cook in 1981 after nine years. He wed Rebecca Dyer the following year, later calling it quits with her in 1986. Following his 14-year union to Linda Thompson, which ended in 2005, Foster married Yolanda Hadid in 2011. Their divorce was finalised in 2017.\n\nMcPhee just confirmed her relationship with Foster at the Met Gala in May. They\u2019ve been romantically linked for a little over a year.\n\nThis story originally appeared on the New York Post and is republished here with permission.", "images":
