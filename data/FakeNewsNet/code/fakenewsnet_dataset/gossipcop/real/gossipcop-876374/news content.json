Anticipation to simply see the film\u2019s trailer reached a fever pitch, and just in time, the first trailer for \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d was released. Starring as Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson is featured prominently in it.\n\nFrom \u201cThe Horse Whisperer\u201d to \u201cGhost in a Shell,\u201d Johansson has worked her way up to reign as one of wealthiest women in Hollywood. She has starred as Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, in six Marvel movies so far, with two more \u2014 including \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d \u2014 still to premiere. Learn how Johansson became one of the highest-paid women in Hollywood.\n\n\n\nBirthdate: Nov. 22, 1984\n\nNet Worth: $140 million\n\nMain Source of Income: acting and endorsements\n\nCareer Highlights: Taking the role of Black Widow and acting in at least eight Marvel movies\n\nScarlett Johansson Net Worth: $140 Million\n\nScarlett Johansson earned the No. 1 spot on Forbes\u2019 Highest Paid Actresses list for 2018, with $40.5 million in earnings. She hasn\u2019t always earned top dollar for her work, however. In 2010, Johansson was paid just $400,000 to star in \u201cIron Man 2,\u201d according to the Los Angeles Times, in her first turn as Natasha Romanoff. Since then, things have changed.\n\nJohansson was paid nearly $20 million for her work as the Black Widow in 2015\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron,\u201d and Forbes cited her earnings at $17.5 million for the 2017 film \u201cGhost in the Shell.\u201d The publication revealed her standard pay rate is more than $10 million per film. This has boosted her net worth to $140 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss: The Richest Action Stars of All Time \u2014 and Their Top-Grossing Films\n\nMovies aren\u2019t Johansson\u2019s only source of income.

Her big break came at age 13 when she gained worldwide notoriety for her critically acclaimed performance in \u201cThe Horse Whisperer.\u201d\n\nJohansson solidified herself as a superstar with her starring role in 2003\u2019s \u201cLost in Translation.\u201d This earned her a Golden Globe nomination for best comedic actress. That same year, she earned another Golden Globe nod for her work in \u201cGirl With a Pearl Earring.\u201d\n\nSince then she\u2019s turned into a bona fide blockbuster star, with her Marvel movies raking in hundreds of millions \u2014 even billions \u2014 of dollars. \u201cGhost in the Shell\u201d was a rare misfire for Johansson. She might have earned millions for it, but the film only grossed $40 million domestically.\n\nJohansson\u2019s talents extend to the stage, where she has starred in two Broadway plays \u2014 \u201cA View From the Bridge\u201d in 2010 and \u201cCat on a Hot Tin Roof\u201d in 2013.
