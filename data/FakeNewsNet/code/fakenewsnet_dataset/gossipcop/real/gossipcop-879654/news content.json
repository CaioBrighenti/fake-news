Just nine months later, sources exclusively told PEOPLE the pair had decided to quietly end their engagement and planned Hawaii wedding.\n\n\u201cJust when I think I\u2019ve learned the way to live, life changes,\u201d Inaba said in a quote on Instagram on Sept. 7, captioning the graphic with prayer hands and a broken-heart emoji.\n\nImage zoom Carrie Ann Inaba and Robb Derringer Kathy Hutchins/Newscom\n\nIt was a sad end to a romance that seemed to blossom immediately.\n\n\u201cI knew after our first romantic date, that if she felt for me what I felt for her, then it was something that was going to be significant and life changing and lasting,\u201d Derringer, 50, told PEOPLE when announcing their engagement. \u201cThere was just a powerful and palpable sense of destiny that I could not deny.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a young girl, I had always dreamed about going on a date like the first date I shared with Robb,\u201d Inaba added at the time. \u201cSomehow, he instinctively knew what that was and went to great lengths to surprise me with the most romantic night ever. I could see then how pure of heart he was and how generous and caring his soul was.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about the evening felt so \u2018right\u2019. There was an ease and an authentic familiarity,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe talked about everything under the stars \u2026 even marriage. There was a strong sense of destiny that night, and I think I knew then, deep in my heart, that he and I were going to be together forever.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Robb Derringer and Carrie Ann Inaba Carrie Ann Inaba\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Carrie Ann Inaba Gushes About Fianc\u00e9 Jesse Sloan\n\nDerringer isn\u2019t Inaba\u2019s first ex-fianc\u00e9.\n\nIn September 2012, a rep for Inaba told PEOPLE that she and Jesse Sloan \u201cdecided early in the summer to break off their engagement and have remained friends.\u201d\n\nSloan, a 45-year-old accountant, had proposed to Inaba on Live! With Regis and Kelly in March 2011 \u2014 surprising her on air. \u201cOur family is spread out all across the country,\u201d Sloan told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cI wanted to be able to share it with our family and friends.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jesse Sloan and Carrie Ann Inaba Gregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a keeper,\u201d Inaba gushed to PEOPLE as she snuggled up to her groom-to-be. \u201cOur family got to witness the whole thing \u2013 along with a lot of other people \u2026 There is no way I would say no to him. He\u2019s my dreamboat and my life is so much better with him in it. It\u2019s just so exciting to know that now we\u2019re going to spend the rest of our life together. And have babies!\u201d\n\nIn the weeks following the surprise proposal, Inaba revealed the duo planned to have a seaside wedding so that their guests could walk barefoot on the sand. The ocean, she told PEOPLE, \u201chas such a spiritual meaning. It\u2019s so vast and yet it unites everyone. We want everybody to get their feet wet in the water after we say our vows.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Artem Chigvintsev and Carrie Ann Inaba Michael Buckner/Getty\n\nPrior to Sloan, Inaba was in a 2\u00bd-year relationship with DWTS pro Artem Chigvintsev.\n\nThe Russian ballroom dancer, who is 14 years her junior, first met Inaba when he was competing on Fox\u2019s So You Think You Can Dance. The two began dating in 2006 and split in November 2008.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my ballroom champ,\u201d Inaba told PEOPLE in October 2006, after the pair had been dating for eight months.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Cost of Dancing With the Stars\u2018 Mirrorball Trophy\n\nTheir breakup, like Inaba\u2019s others, was amicable.\n\n\u201cArtem and I broke up in the beginning of November,\u201d she told PEOPLE in February 2009. \u201cAs much as our relationship was really good,\u201d she added, the two realized that neither \u201cwas \u2018the one\u2019 for the other. It was very sad to let go of something that was so good on so many levels.\u201d\n\nShe also praised her ex for being \u201ca fine gentleman,\u201d saying, \u201cI have never gone out with somebody that grounded, always ready to talk it out. I\u2019m very happy for him and the success he\u2019s having.\u201d\n\nChigvintsev will be back for season 25 of DWTS, paired with Nikki Bella.", "images":
