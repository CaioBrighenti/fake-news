He showed the royals the particular flowers \u2014 some of which were the princess\u2019s favorites, including white lilies \u2014 that had been cultivated to mark her life.\n\nImage zoom Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\nImage zoom Chris Radburn/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWhite tulips, daffodils and hyacinths bloomed in spring and were followed by white roses, lilies, gladioli, cosmos, gaura and fragrant nemesia that arrived in summer. \u201cAs we\u2019ve been working in the garden, many of our palace visitors have stopped to talk to us and share their own memories of Diana, Princess of Wales,\u201d Harkin said in April. \u201cWe hope that our garden captures the energy and spirit that made her such a popular figure around the world.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\nImage zoom Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP\n\nImage zoom Courtesy Historical Royal Palaces\n\nThe palace is where the princes lived with their late mother and where they both have their London homes \u2014 William with Kate and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at Apartment 1a, and Harry at two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage within the complex.\n\nImage zoom Courtesy Historical Royal Palaces\n\nImage zoom\n\nAs the summer has progressed, PEOPLE has been paying tribute to Diana (who appeared on the cover of the magazine a record 59 times) via the two-part television event The Story of Diana and in interviews with those who knew her best, including her younger brother Charles, 9th Earl Spencer, as well as those who worked with her to smash stigmas or alongside her at charities such as the Royal Marsden cancer hospital.\n\nFor full PEOPLE coverage of the 20th anniversary of Princess Diana\u2019s death:\n\n\u2022PEOPLE\u2019s special edition Diana: Her Life and Legacy is available now\n\n\u2022Princess Diana: Behind the Headlines is streaming on the new People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN).
