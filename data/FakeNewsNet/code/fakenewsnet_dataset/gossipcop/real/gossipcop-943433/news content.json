Photo: REX/Shutterstock\n\nWhile we were all certainly thrilled that Prince Louis, a baby, finally decided to grace us with his presence at his christening on Monday, we have to admit that the 2-month-old infant\u2019s royal siblings \u2014 Prince George and Princess Charlotte, naturally \u2014 once again stole the show.\n\nAs you\u2019ll recall, on the day Prince Louis was born (which, again, was only a little over two months ago), you\u2019d think everyone would have been obsessed with the newborn baby. But instead, we were all so taken with the adorable antics of his older brother and sister \u2014 to the degree that the photographers at the hospital let out an audible and collective \u201cawwww,\u201d and videos of Princess Charlotte adorably waving to the crowd were quickly shared all over social media.\n\nToo cute. Photo: Dominic Lipinski/AP\n\nSo understandably, the same thing happened again at Chapel Royal at St. James\u2019s Palace in London for the royal christening. It was nice to see the sweet Prince Louis and, erm, we wish him all the best in his religious pursuits, but Princess Charlotte and Prince George were simply too cute to ignore.\n\nWhen the new family of five (hi, Kate Middleton and Prince William!) arrived at the chapel, the young prince and princess were on their best behavior. They entered the premises on either side of their father, then they both adorably shook hands with the church officials present, and quietly took in the scene with their hands in their mouths, as they are children.\n\nSorry for the delayed tweets! Have been filming. Very peaceful atmosphere here at St James\u2019s Palace and the weather is perfect!\n\nShort video of William, Kate, George, Charlotte, Louis, Meghan, Harry, Charles and Camilla arriving for the #RoyalChristening... pic.twitter.com/wLjzimElX9 \u2014 Omid Scobie (@scobie) July 9, 2018\n\nA very gorgeous - and quiet - Prince Louis. pic.twitter.com/k3Ra4bEZr8 \u2014 Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) July 9, 2018\n\nAfter the baptism, the cute family emerged from the chapel \u2014 and Princess Charlotte gave one of her trademark waves again.\n\nThe Cambridge\u2019s depart and another wave from Princess Charlotte pic.twitter.com/lLNH5NcmEL \u2014 Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) July 9, 2018\n\nThe Royal Family of Five leave the Chapel Royal following Prince Louis\u2019s christening pic.twitter.com/BZXVeG6SKN \u2014 Simon Perry (@SPerryPeoplemag) July 9, 2018\n\nSorry, Prince Louis!", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/11/MM0143_LG_VALENTINO_5617_31_V4.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-alien-area-51.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-helen-mirren.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-belle-delphine.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/party-pics/party-pics-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-alligator-lagoon.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/08/8-Ghislaine-Maxwell.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-serena-williams-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-quilt.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/07/12/sales/12-Sales-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-donald-trump-aubrey-o-day.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-allie-long-1.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/09/09-prince-louis-christening-3.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/09/09-prince-louis-christening-4.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-Marc-Veyrat-cheddar.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/09/09-prince-louis-christening-3.w330.h412.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/07/11/outdoor-voices-micro/11-outdoor-voices-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/GettyImages-1133537447-feed.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/galleries/thecut/2019/07/Weddings-1/10-header.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-luann-1.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/HL_LG_HERO.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/10/10-boia.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/09/09-prince-louis-christening-3.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Ryan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/princess-charlotte-prince-george-louis-christening.html", "title": "Princess Charlotte, Prince George At Louis\u2019s Christening", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Princess Charlotte and Prince George Steal the Show at Brother\u2019s Christening", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/princess-charlotte-prince-george-louis-christening.html", "description": "Sorry not sorry, Prince Louis.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/09/09-prince-louis-christening-3.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Princess Charlotte, Prince George at Brother\u2019s Christening", "description": "Sorry not sorry, Prince Louis.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/07/09/09-prince-louis-christening-3.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@lisarya", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-09T12:33:10.920-04:00", "tag": "royal babies, culture, celebrity, princess charlotte, prince george, kate middleton, prince william, video", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Princess Charlotte and Prince George attended their little brother Prince Louis\u2019s christening on Monday with their parents Kate Middleton and Prince William.
