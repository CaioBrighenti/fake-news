But I gotta just say tho. The \u201csometimes lighter is better\u201d Heineken commercial is terribly racist omg.\"\n\nThe commercial in question features a bartender who spots a woman across a rooftop bar. In hopes of sliding her a Heineken, he floats over the beverage, while having it pass by a Black woman and an older Black man. When the drink finally arrives in the desired woman's hands, the campaign's tagline, \"Sometimes, lighter is better\" pops up at the conclusion of the commercial.\n\nLater, Chance chimed back in on his previous comments and said that he wasn't urging people to \"boycott,\" but instead, was pointing out the numerous times controversial ads were spearheaded by racist comments.\n\n\"Im not saying boycott them or go off im just noticing how often it happens and I think they baiting consumers and tweeters and freelancers and shit. Like I didnt wanna tweet about it so bad but its like how can u not.\"\n\n\n\nCheck out the commercial and Chance's tweeted comments below.\n\nI think some companies are purposely putting out noticably racist ads so they can get more views. And that shit racist/bogus so I guess I shouldn\u2019t help by posting about it. But -- I gotta just say tho.
