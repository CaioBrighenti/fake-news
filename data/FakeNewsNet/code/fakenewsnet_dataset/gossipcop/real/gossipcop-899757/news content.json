{"url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B078HF8KHB", "text": "Like Johnny Appleseed, Annie Oakley, and possibly Harry Houdini, P.T. Barnum has become less a figure of history than a giant of American popular folklore. And since Barnum himself never pretended to possess more than a passing relationship with the truth, it\u2019s richly appropriate that \u201cThe Greatest Showman,\u201d the new movie which uses as its foundation the life of the father of the circus, does not even bother to use the usual opening gambit, \u201cbased on a true story.\u201d Because it rarely is.\n\n\n\nInstead, before the opening credits even hit the screen the movie throws the audience by the seat of its pants into the most foot-stomping, pulse-pounding, show-stopping entertainment since the circus came to town. The picture grabs the viewer by his nose and doesn\u2019t let go from the first frame of film until the last. And after the show is over, the viewer leaves with a song in his heart, a smile on his face, a spring in his step, and a tear in his eye.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d follows the tried-and-true formula of Horatio Alger and dozens of motion pictures biographies, from \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d to \u201cNight and Day\u201d to \u201cYankee Doodle Dandy\u201d: Through hard work and dedication, the hero rises from poverty to the pinnacle of success, falters for a moment, and then through faith and love achieves an even more lofty and soul-satisfying conclusion.\n\n\n\nBut \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d continues the hallowed entertainment tradition to the beat of a percussive and pounding drum-driven hip-hop tempo of street music, accompanied by the most jaw-dropping breakdance moves you\u2019ll ever see in an ensemble performance.\n\n\n\nDuring the opening scene the world explodes into a panorama of vivid colors embracing in its entirety the world of the circus\u2014flying acrobats, prancing horses, fire-breathers, elephants, and clowns. When the song ends, it\u2019s all you can do to stop yourself from jumping to your feet to applaud. And then the movie tops itself, over and over and over again.\n\n\n\nAnyone who\u2019s seen Hugh Jackman appearing on an interview show\u2014and he\u2019s doing a lot of them in support of this movie\u2014knows that his signature role as the caustic and violent Wolverine in eight \u201cX-Men\u201d movies are the real stretch for the actor.\n\n\n\nThe very definition of the term \u201camiable bloke,\u201d the Australian Jackman at heart is a song-and-dance man. And in \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d Jackman proves it\u2014the actor whirls, jumps, kicks, cakewalks, and struts with such loose-limbed dexterity that he often seems immune to laws of gravity.\n\n\n\nMatching Jackman almost step-by-step, scene-by-scene, and note-by-note are a talented array of supporting performers, including Zac Efron as a highbrow New York playwright persuaded by Barnum to join the circus as a means of broadening the show\u2019s appeal, and the platinum-selling pop star Zendaya as the trapeze artist Efron falls for. One highlight among many in the picture is the ballad \u201cRewrite the Stars,\u201d performed by Zendaya and Efron in a sort of aerial ballet courting ritual under the big top.\n\n\n\nLikewise, the exotic Keala Settle, playing the bearded lady among the uniquely-gifted and physically distinctive show people recruited by Barnum to star in his \u201cGreatest Show,\u201d provides much of the heart and soul of the movie. Settle\u2019s performance of \u201cThis is Me\u201d adds real spirit to an anthem for the heartbreaking loneliness of individuality, and the empowerment found in accepting yourself as you are.\n\n\n\nThe gifted Michelle Williams is as adorable as usual as Barnum\u2019s patient wife, Charity, and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson adds European flavor as opera star Jenny Lind, persuaded by impresario Barnum to undertake a series of US concerts under his tutelage in a bid to gain acceptance among the more rarefied echelons of society.\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is receiving mixed reviews from some of the country\u2019s more influential critics. Some are turning up their collective noses at the movie\u2019s \u201csoupy soulfulness\u201d and shallow, populist aspirations.\n\n\n\nBut the picture in its depiction of the contentious \u201cfriendly enemy\u201d relationship between Barnum and newspaper critic James Gordon Bennett seems to anticipate the unflattering reviews. When Barnum is confronted with the challenge that everything connected with his show is \u201cfake,\u201d Barnum points to the circus\u2019 audience and smilingly replies, \u201cThose smiles seem real enough.\u201d And you know what? He\u2019s right.\n\n\n\nWritten by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and guided to the screen by first-time director Michael Gracey, \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d steps up to the plate and bats a grand slam home run in just about every single department. And with a dozen or so rousing, showstopping songs courtesy of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the Academy Award-winning lyricists from last year\u2019s \u201cLa La Land,\u201d the viewer might even want to stop on the way home after the movie to pick up a copy of the soundtrack album.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is superb motion picture entertainment in the tradition of the great Hollywood musicals, and as close as we\u2019re likely to get to a Broadway experience simulated in a movie auditorium. There\u2019s real movie magic at work here: This is one picture packed with an ingredient rarely found in films these days\u2014it\u2019s spelled J-O-Y, and it has a big exclamation point at the end.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of competition out there for your family entertainment dollar during this holiday season. If you can only see one movie this month, \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d is the choice you want to make. Any movie which depicts a father riding to his daughter\u2019s musical recital on a dancing elephant is doing something awfully right.\n\n\n\nThe highest praise\u2014P.T. Barnum would love this picture. And so will you.", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/8ef5465d-d204-4877-aa9a-36f15481281f._CR83,0,333,333_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91tUTwOGemL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/video/merch/subs/benefit-id/a-f/cinemax/logos/3p-logo._CB525364801_SY35_FMpng_.png", "https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:144-0820678-7544732:32KRHGKEZQ32HACVNM2B$uedata=s:%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fdetail%2FB078HF8KHB%2Fuedata%2Funsticky%2F144-0820678-7544732%2FVideo%2Fntpoffrw%3Fstaticb%26id%3D32KRHGKEZQ32HACVNM2B%26pty%3DDetail%26spty%3DMovie%26pti%3DB000K2EQBW:1000", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global_bluebeacon-1x_optimized_layout1._CB468670774_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81y9JSeQIeL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81PTK-IYhWL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/1ab9402b-4bc7-44a7-8a3a-cc2bbcd6a348._CR0,0,415,415_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81wJD67EVxL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716fA7BwC2L._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Gt6NZHmVL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Nnr2T3PlL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814OPpPD+uL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91uyBoZtqFL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BUlplXKiL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91m9tUCsd7L._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:144-0820678-7544732:32KRHGKEZQ32HACVNM2B$uedata=s:%2Fgp%2Fvideo%2Fdetail%2FB078HF8KHB%2Fuedata%2Funsticky%2F144-0820678-7544732%2FVideo%2Fntpoffrw%3Fnoscript%26id%3D32KRHGKEZQ32HACVNM2B%26pty%3DDetail%26spty%3DMovie%26pti%3DB078HF8KHB:2000", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Events/2019/01112499/gw-armadillo-desktop-en/us_armadillo_gw_dt_swm_400x39_a_en._CB461720680_.png", "https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B078HF8KHB/uedata/unsticky/144-0820678-7544732/Video/ntpoffrw?noscript&id=32KRHGKEZQ32HACVNM2B&pty=Detail&spty=Movie&pti=B078HF8KHB", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91+kXNuAxBL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91X7xF2b1VL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/sgp-catalog-images/region_US/fox-031264-Full-Image_GalleryBackground-en-US-1556295945992._SX1080_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91wiEjBXKzL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OGS8ZOduL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/916jY22coDL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/810XUg2BCkL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91mPBc21TcL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xqg6lqMuL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/918gSJ+CuXL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif"], "top_img": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/sgp-catalog-images/region_US/fox-031264-Full-Image_GalleryBackground-en-US-1556295945992._SX1080_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Showman-Hugh-Jackman/dp/B078HF8KHB", "title": "Amazon.com: Watch The Greatest Showman", "meta_data": {"description": "Hugh Jackman stars in this bold and original musical - inspired by the ambition and imagination of P.T.
