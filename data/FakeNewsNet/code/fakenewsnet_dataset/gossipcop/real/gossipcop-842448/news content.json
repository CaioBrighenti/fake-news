Why does it have to be one or the other?\u201d\n\nEmily has two movies in post-production \u2013 In Darkness, in which she stars alongside Natalie Dormer and Joely Richardson and romance Cruise.\n\nWhile her good looks see her offered a variety of film roles, Emily has become more picky about the projects she takes on.\n\nThese days, she is determined to take on parts that offer her more than just a chance to show off her stunning figure.\n\n\u201cI am way more interested in working with unexpected and cool directors on interesting projects than being in this big studio movie where you\u2019re in a bikini,\u201d she added. \u201cI turn down a lot of movies, but I have to fight for the ones that I really want.\u201d\n\nEmily previously penned an essay for Glamour.com in which she insisted it\u2019s wrong for women to be accused of seeking attention more often than men \u2013 regardless of whether it\u2019s for speaking out on political issues, dressing a certain way or even for posting selfies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd to think that desire for attention doesn\u2019t drive both women and men,\u201d she wrote in the essay. \u201cWhy are women scrutinized for it more, then? And if a woman dresses up because she does want attention, male or otherwise, does that make her guilty of something? Or less \u2018serious\u2019? Our society doesn\u2019t question men\u2019s motivations for taking their shirt off, or shaving, or talking about politics \u2013 nor should it. Wanting attention is genderless. It\u2019s human.\u201d", "images": ["https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1134371788-e1563030064522.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/secret.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-821077268-e1562865286660.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=107&h=80&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/vassel-e1536236220271.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297944302656_ORIGINAL.jpg?size=520x", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shootingislington-e1563027099390.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/990309138/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shoppandemonium-e1562705653957.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=107&h=80&crop=1", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shootingislington-e1563027099390.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/498ea01ee88beecb59be73ea42c1f3c6?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1134349062.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ts20190712jb025-e1562979790964.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/toronto-desktop.png", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kimkline.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all"], "top_img": "http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297944302656_ORIGINAL.jpg?size=520x", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://torontosun.com/2017/04/11/emily-ratajkowski-why-cant-i-be-a-feminist-sex-symbol/wcm/c515173d-1a62-4fe3-8bfe-3f2936f9a2fe", "title": "Emily Ratajkowski: 'Why can't I be a feminist sex symbol?'", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "Emily Ratajkowski is determined to fight back against people stereotyping her as an empty-headed sex symbol.
