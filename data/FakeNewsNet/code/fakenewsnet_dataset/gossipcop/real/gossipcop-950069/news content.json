I have stretch marks on my boobs. My stomach isn\u2019t the same, my waist isn\u2019t the same, my butt\u2019s bigger, my thighs [are] bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd honestly, I\u2019m finding I have to change my style a little because nothing in my closet fits me from before,\u201d she continued.\n\nAfter previously announcing in the video that she had \u201cplanned my first workout on Monday,\u201d the Kylie Cosmetics mogul added, \u201cI really want to get my core back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like I have fake abs now, it\u2019s just like, genetics. But I want real abs. I know I can have a super fit body. And just for my health \u2014 I want to do this. I want to feel good,\u201d she explained.\n\nImage zoom Kylie Jenner and daughter Stormi Kylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nRELATED: Kylie Jenner Says Daughter Stormi Is \u2018Changing\u2019 Every Week: \u2018She Has the Cutest Personality\u2019\n\nBut even though watching her body \u201cgo through such a change\u201d at her age was \u201cphysically, mentally, and emotionally a challenge,\u201d Jenner added that it was \u201calso a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was such a great pregnancy and birth.
