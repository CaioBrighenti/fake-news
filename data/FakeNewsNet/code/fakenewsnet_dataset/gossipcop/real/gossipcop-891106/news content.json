BROWN AFP/Getty Images Actress and TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey poses with the Cecil B. DeMille Award during the 75th Golden Globe Awards on January 7, 2018, in Beverly Hills, California. / AFP PHOTO / Frederic J. BROWN (Photo credit should read FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThere\u2019s no endorsement a retail product wants more in the holiday shopping season than a spot on Oprah\u2019s Favorite Things. This year, 107 products have received the Winfrey push, the biggest list ever.\n\nWinfrey has released this year\u2019s list in the upcoming issue of her magazine O, and among the big-name winners are Amazon (which not only got a shout out for its Echo Spot, but is once again partnering with Winfrey to let people buy the products she favored), Lands End (whose hooded winter coat got a nod) and Samsung (for the second year in a row, its Q7FN QLED TV, which displays artwork when it\u2019s turned off, made the list).\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good if you\u2019re Oprah rich. But for the rest of us, gathering those things is going to put a major dent in our bank account.\n\nAll totaled, purchasing each of the 107 items will run you just shy of $16,000. (Some of the items, though, are currently offering discounts that could lower that total a bit.) That\u2019s about $2,000 more than the grand total of last year\u2019s list.\n\nPerhaps mindful of that price tag, this year\u2019s Oprah\u2019s Favorite Things list also keeps budget-restricted shoppers in mind, with 50 items below $50.\n\nSo what\u2019s driving the price up? Here are a few of the more notable items:\n\nStory Bikes Electric Step-Through Bike\n\nThis unisex bike not only lets you cruise around town at speeds of up to 20mph, it also includes a USB outlet to charge your phone and will go up to 45 miles on a single charge. It\u2019ll run you $1,695 normally.\n\nIzola Cocktail Straws\n\nAs restaurant chains do away with straws, Winfrey is promoting these copper plated, stainless steel reusable ones, which carry a $20 price tag.\n\nPitcher No. Nine Hundred Seventy One\n\nPour your lemonade from this $198 pitcher, which also doubles as a decorative vase.\n\nCarl the Drinking Chocolate Snowman\n\nWe love hot cocoa too, but $38 seems a bit high for five to eight cups.\n\nPopinsanity Artisanal Popcorn Multi-Flavored Popcorn Tin\n\nSame thinking as with Carl above. Popcorn. Great! $180 popcorn? What?", "images": ["https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3liuz.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&f=png",
