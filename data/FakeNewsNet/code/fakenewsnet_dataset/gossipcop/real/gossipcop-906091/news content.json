After welcoming twins with Anna Kournikova on Dec. 16, the singer released a hot new video, \u201cEl Ba\u00f1o,\u201d featuring Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny on Jan. 12 \u2014 and it\u2019s driving fans wild. The teaser of the video alone, which he posted the day before, was enough to fire up his followers. \u201cHooked,\u201d one wrote. Another raved: \u201cI love it, I just listen to it all the time!\u201d\n\nIn the racy video, the Spanish singer becomes enthralled with a mysterious dark-eyed brunette (played by Pollyanna Uruena) he meets at a bar. The scene between the two young paramours plays out, like ground hog day, over and over again, under the sly, knowing eyes of the bartender (actor Eric Roberts.) Filled with erotic wordplay, the singer invites the seductive stranger to exchange an endless kiss in the nearby bathroom, which she eventually accepts. In each successive meeting, the two get closer and closer, leading to a full blown steamy liaison.\n\nBad Bunny urges beauty: \u201cHave fun coz life is going fast\u2026have fun life is only one.\u201d Although some fans took umbrage with some of the tune\u2019s cruder lines, such as: \u201cEvery time I see you/You make me so hard/So hard to believe/That you will be mine,\u201d as translated by Billboard, the video has already garnered more than 16.6 million views on YouTube.\n\nThe Puerto Rican rapper\u2019s musical collaboration with Bad Bunny is his latest. Last year, he teamed up with Becky G on \u201cMayores\u201d and J.Balvin on \u201cSi Tu Novio Te Deja Sola.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/luis-fonsi-tout.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/jlo-tout.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/enrique-iglesias.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C787.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/shakira-tout1.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-09-at-10-59-45-am.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kim-kardashian1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/foto-11-12-17-13-31-02.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/daddy-yankee2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/enrique-iglesias-2-435.jpg?w=435&h=580&crop=1", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pitbull-latin-lover.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/shakira-and-pique-tout.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/pitbull-tout.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/wisin-and-yandel.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/zuleyka-feature.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/enrique-iglesias-2-435.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-648458410.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/danry-vasquez-fabiana-reyes-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/mau-y-ricky.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/enrique-and-anna-tout.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/3-oscar-zeta-acosta-1970-photo-courtesy-of-raul-ruiz.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ricky-feature.jpeg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/enrique-iglesias-twins.png?crop=0px%2C344px%2C952px%2C500px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/enrique-iglesias-2-435.jpg?w=435&h=580&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lena Hansen"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/chica/watch-enrique-iglesias-music-video-el-bano/", "title": "WATCH: Enrique Iglesias' Steamy New Video for Controversial Single 'El Ba\u00f1o'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "enrique iglesias, bad bunny, enrique iglesias bad bunny, enrique iglesias el bano, music video, el bano music video, enrique iglesias bad bunny music video", "news_keywords": "enrique iglesias, bad bunny, enrique iglesias bad bunny, enrique iglesias el bano, music video, el bano music video, enrique iglesias bad bunny music video", "description": "Enrique Iglesias' new music video \"El Ba\u00f1o\" featuring Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, is out now.
