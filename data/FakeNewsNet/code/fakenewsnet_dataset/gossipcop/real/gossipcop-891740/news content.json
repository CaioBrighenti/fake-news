Still a family outing!\u201d she captioned a selfie with David and their 16-year-old daughter Sophie.\n\nThe reality star then addressed trolls, saying, \u201cAnd for those that have negatively commented, it\u2019s all about my kids. Have a nice night.\u201d\n\nThe couple \u2014 who have been married for 17 years and share three daughters together: Sophie and twins Stella and Adeline, 13 \u2014 split a little over a month ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking for me and my daughters that this is the road that had to be taken but it\u2019s the only way,\u201d Shannon exclusively told PEOPLE about her breakup. \u201cI felt alone in my marriage. You can do what you can to keep your family together, but you have to have willing parties. You need two people to make a marriage work, and that just wasn\u2019t happening in our relationship.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: RHOC\u2018s Shannon Beador and David Beador Have Separated After 17 Years of Marriage\n\nIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster few years for the Beadors, as documented through the course of Shannon\u2019s four seasons on RHOC. In season 10, she revealed that David was unfaithful to her in an affair she learned about just days before filming began. The couple then spent time repairing their marriage through therapy and open dialogue with their family.", "images":
