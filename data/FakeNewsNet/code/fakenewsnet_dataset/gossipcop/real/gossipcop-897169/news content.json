But he was a fighter\u2026 He was our light. He made our life better.\u201d\n\nThe ALS Ice Bucket Challenge went viral and raised $115 million during two months in 2014 \u2014 money that went largely to fund research. And Anthony Senerchia played a significant role in getting it started.\n\nWhen Jeanette Senerchia\u2019s cousin, golfer Chris Kennedy, was nominated early on to participate in the challenge, it was not yet specifically connected to ALS. But when Kennedy passed along the challenge to others, he chose the ALS Association as a beneficiary because of Anthony Senerchia\u2019s battle with the disease. It took off from there.\n\n\u201cWhat started out as a small gesture to put a smile on Anthony\u2019s face and bring some awareness to this terrible disease has turned into a national phenomenon,\u201d Kennedy told TIME in 2014, \u201cand it is something we never could have dreamed of.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Time.com.", "images":
