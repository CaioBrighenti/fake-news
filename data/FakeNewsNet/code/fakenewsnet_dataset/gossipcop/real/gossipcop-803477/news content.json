She also ranked first in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2016 and 2019), and was the youngest to be featured in the magazine's listing of the 100 most powerful women (2015).\n\nLife and career\n\n1989\u20132003: Early life\n\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\u00e9e Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[2] Swift, who has said she has Scottish heritage[3] was named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[4] She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor.[5] Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients.[6][7] She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns,[8] before transferring to The Wyndcroft School.[9] The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[10] where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[11]\n\nAt the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[12] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[13] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[14] She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events.[15][16] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career.[17] At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[18] However, she was rejected since \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\".[19]\n\nWhen Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \"Lucky You\".[20][21] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modelled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[22] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[23][24]\n\nTo help Swift break into country music, her father transferred to the Nashville office of Merrill Lynch when she was 14, and the family relocated to a lakefront house in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[6][25] Swift attended Hendersonville High School,[26] but after two years transferred to the Aaron Academy, which through homeschooling could accommodate her touring schedule, and she graduated a year early.[27]\n\n2004\u20132008: Career beginnings and Taylor Swift\n\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers.[28][29] She eventually formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[30] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[31] Rose thought that the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks\". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[32] but left RCA Records when she was 14.[16] She later recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through\".[33]\n\nSwift was at an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005 when she caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had met Borchetta in 2004.[34] Swift became one of the record label's first signings, and her father purchased a three percent stake in the fledgling company at an estimated cost of $120,000.[35][36] She began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing the record deal, and persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\".[16] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with writers Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[37] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[38] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as \"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice\".[39] Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and spent 157 weeks on the ranking, marking the longest stay on the chart by any release in the country in the 2000s decade.[40] As of August 2016 the album has sold over 7.75 million copies worldwide.[41]\n\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", and Swift and her mother helped \"stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio\".[42] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour, television appearances, and opening for Rascal Flatts on select dates of their 2006 tour.[43][44] Swift was hired to open for Rascal Flatts after they fired their previous opening act, Eric Church, for playing longer than his allotted time. Church jokingly told Swift that she should give her first gold record as a thanks for him getting fired. She eventually did send him her first gold record, with a note that said \"Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it. Taylor.\"[45] Borchetta has said that record industry peers disliked his signing of a 16-year-old singer-songwriter at first, but that Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\u2014teenage girls who listen to country music.[6] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All were highly successful on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart in the United States, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" both reaching number one. For the former, Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the chart.[46] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" became a moderate commercial success, reaching number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart in the United States.[47] Swift also released the holiday album Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and the EP Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[48][49] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other artists on their tours.[50]\n\nSwift won accolades for Taylor Swift.

Swift was the youngest artist ever to win Album of the Year.[76] During the ceremony, Swift sang \"You Belong with Me\" and \"Rhiannon\" with Stevie Nicks. Her vocal performance received negative reviews and a media backlash.[72][77] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found it \"refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub\" and described Swift as \"the most important new pop star of the past few years\".[78] Swift became the youngest ever artist to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association.[79] Fearless also won the Association's Album of the Year award.[80]\n\nSwift contributed backing vocals to John Mayer's \"Half of My Heart\", a single featured on his fourth album, Battle Studies (2009).[81] She co-wrote and recorded \"Best Days of Your Life\" with Kellie Pickler,[82] and co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\u2014\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\".[68] Swift also provided vocals for Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One\".[83] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which became her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.[84][85] While filming her cinematic debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift began a romantic relationship with co-star Taylor Lautner, but they broke up later that year.[86][87] The romantic comedy, released the following year, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role in which Los Angeles Times found \"serious comedic potential\".[88] In a scathing review, the critic for Variety deemed her \"entirely undirected\", arguing that \"she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy\".[89]\n\nSwift made her acting debut in a 2009 episode of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing a rebellious teenager. The New York Times noted that the character allowed Swift to be \"a little bit naughty, and credibly so\".[90] Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest for an episode of Saturday Night Live.[91] Entertainment Weekly described her as \"this season's best Saturday Night Live host so far\", noting that she \"was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines\".[92]\n\n2010\u20132014: Speak Now and Red\n\nIn August 2010, Swift released \"Mine\", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It entered the United States at number three, making Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 (after Mariah Carey) to debut multiple tracks in the top five in one year; the other was \"Today Was a Fairytale\" at number two.[93] Swift wrote the album alone and co produced every track.[94] Speak Now, released on October 25, 2010,[38] was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, and becoming the 16th album to achieve opening week sales of one million copies.[95] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week, earning Swift an entry in the 2010 Guinness World Records.

Claire Suddath of Time felt she \"delivered her comeback on-key and with a vengeance\";[100] Jayme Deerwester of USA Today wrote that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have \"made her a better songwriter and live performer\".[101] Swift won various other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone placed Speak Now at number 45 in its 2012 list of the \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\", writing: \"She might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click.\"[108]\n\nThe Speak Now World Tour ran from February 2011 to March 2012 and grossed over $123 million.[109] In November 2011, Swift released her first live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live.[110] The following month, she contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: \"Safe & Sound\", cowritten and recorded with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and \"Eyes Open\". \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[111] Swift contributed vocals to rapper B.o.B's \"Both of Us\", released in May 2012.[112] From July to September 2012, Swift dated political heir Conor Kennedy.[113] In August, Swift released \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", the lead single from her fourth studio album, Red.

In addition, UMG agreed to, in the event that it sells portions of its stake in Spotify, distribute proceeds among its artists and make them non-recoupable.[207] On December 31, Reputation Stadium Tour, a concert film based on the tour was released on Netflix.[208]\n\nSwift's second release with Republic Records, \"Me!\" served as the lead single from her upcoming seventh studio album titled Lover, featuring Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco, on April 26, 2019.[209][210][211] The song debuted at number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100, but jumped to number 2 in its second week, becoming the biggest single-week jump in the Hot 100's history.[212] The music video for \"Me!\" broke Swift's personal record by amassing 65.2 million views within its first day of release.[213] On June 14, she released the second single \"You Need to Calm Down\",[214] and on that same night, Swift gave a surprise performance at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, to commemorate Stonewall 50 - WorldPride NYC 2019.[215]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nOne of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[2] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own\".[216] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[217] She also attributes her \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother.[218] Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music,[219] and was introduced to the genre by \"the great female country artists of the '90s\"\u2014Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[220][221] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[222] Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it\".[223] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[224] The band's \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[225] Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Tammy Wynette.[15] She believes Parton is \"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\".[226] Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams,[227] Patty Griffin[228] and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.[6]\n\nSwift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones,[133] Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: \"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\".[6][229] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that\".[230] She admires Springsteen for being \"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\".[231] She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: \"It's not about fame for her, it's about music\".[232] \"[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out\", Swift says.[233] She admires Simon's \"songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person\".[234]\n\nSwift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has \"unwavering devotion\" for Spears.[235][236] In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional,[237] Fall Out Boy,[238] and Jimmy Eat World.[239] She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch,[239] Alanis Morissette,[240] Ashlee Simpson,[241] Fefe Dobson,[239] Colbie Caillat,[242] Beyonc\u00e9,[243] and Justin Timberlake;[244] and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys.[245] Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and \"Like a Prayer-era Madonna\".[246] Discussing Madonna, Swift said \"One element of Madonna's career that really takes center stage is how many times she's reinvented herself. It's easier to stay in one look, one comfort zone, one musical style. It's inspiring to see someone whose only predictable quality is being unpredictable.\"[247]\n\nMusical style\n\nSwift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock, and country.[248] She had described herself as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she described as a \"sonically cohesive pop album\".[249] Rolling Stone wrote: \"[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\"[250] According to The New York Times, \"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country\u2014a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar\u2014but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville\".[251] The Guardian wrote that Swift \"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory\".[252]\n\nSwift's vocals were described by Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter as \"sweet, but soft\".[253] The Los Angeles Times identified Swift's \"defining\" vocal gesture in studio recordings as \"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy\".[254] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, wrote: \"Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.\"[255] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice wrote that her phrasing was previously \"bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean.\"[256] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her live vocals are \"fine\", but they do not match those of her peers.[253] In 2009, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described Swift's vocals as \"flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt\".[257] However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[258]\n\nIn an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\"[6] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is \"not the best technical singer\", but described her as the \"best communicator that we've got\".[259] Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has \"put a lot of work\" into improving it.[260] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[261] She has said that she only feels nervous performing \"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows\".[262]\n\nSongwriting\n\nSwift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work.[263] In her songs, Swift often addresses the \"anonymous crushes of her high school years\" and celebrities.[264] Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends,[265] an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: \"Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.\"[266] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to \"mine her personal life for music ... is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers\".[267] Swift said that not all her songs are factual and that they are sometimes based on observations.[268] Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically \"because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus\".[269]\n\nSwift during her Speak Now World Tour in Pittsburgh , 2011\n\nFor a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated\u2014a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way\u2014that's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist. Swift in response to criticism of her songwriting[270]\n\nThe Guardian has praised Swift for writing about teenage years \"with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia\" over the course of her first two albums.[252] New York has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but \"none made great records so explicitly about their teens\". The magazine has also compared her work to Brian Wilson.[271] In Fearless, Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect \"between fairy tales and the reality of love\".[272] Her later albums address more adult relationships.[229] In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships,[273][274] alienation, fame, and career ambitions.[218] Swift frequently includes \"a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative\".[275]\n\nRolling Stone describes Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[276] According to The Village Voice, she uses third-verse point of view reversals frequently.[275] In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In The Guardian's words, \"she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot\".[252] Slant Magazine adds, \"to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album\".[277] Although reviews of Swift's work are \"almost uniformly positive\", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[6]\n\nFilmmaking\n\nSwift has collaborated with many different directors for her music videos, and over time she has become more involved as a filmmaker in regards to writing and directing. Swift has her own production house, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., to which the music video for \"Me!\" has been credited.[278] In 2010, she co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White.[279] In 2011, she continued to collaborate with White on the music videos for \"Mean\" and \"Ours\". Swift developed the concept and treatment of the former video.[280] In an interview, White elaborated that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[281] Swift wrote the concept of the \"Ours\" music video and then brought on White to direct, describing her vision of both videos as being \"storylines\".[282][283]\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos. They were split evenly between four from her album 1989 and four from her album Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's filmmaking abilities and her involvement in the craft.[284] In 2016, he described one of their early collaborations positively, explaining that, \"It was literally one of the first times I felt that someone actually spoke the language of filmmaking that I've been doing over the last 25 years.\"[285] During that same period, Swift worked with American Express for her \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed), and released the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience. Swift received starring and executive producer credit, and in 2015 won a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Interactive Program for the app.[286]\n\nIn 2018, Swift developed the concept and then wrote the treatment for the music video of the Sugarland song \"Babe\", which she also co-wrote.[287] She then co-starred in the video alongside the two members of Sugarland Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, and directed by Anthony Mandler. Nettles described it as \"cinematic\" and \"a period piece\", while Bush referenced its Mad Men influences.[288] Nettles also said that, \"I have a feeling we'll see her directing at some point soon, because she was really good at it.\"[289] In 2019, Swift co-directed the music video for \"Me!\" with Dave Meyer and \"You Need to Calm Down\" with Drew Kirsch. She also co-executive produced the latter with Todrick Hall.[290][291]\n\nPublic image\n\nSwift's personal life is the subject of constant media attention.[292] In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a \"slut-shaming\" remark directed toward her.[293] The New York Times asserted that her \"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \"quarter-life crisis\".[294] Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public,[292] as she believes that talking about it can be \"a career weakness\".[295]\n\nRolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: \"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.\"[296] The magazine also takes note of her \"ease with glad-handing\",[35] and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as \"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\".[297] While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who \"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\".[298] Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model.[299] Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans.[300][301] She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed \"Swiftmas\".[302] She considers it her \"responsibility\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans,[303] and has said that her fans are \"the longest and best relationship I have ever had\".[304]\n\nOften described by the media as \"America's Sweetheart\",[305] Swift insists that \"I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots,[306] although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol.[307] Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.[308] In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list.[309] In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards,[310] and ranked first in Maxim's Hot 100 list.[311]\n\nSwift has also appeared in various power listings. She was included in Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[312] From 2011 to 2015, she appeared in the top three of the Forbes Top-Earning Women in Music with earnings of $45 million, $57 million, $55 million, $64 million, and $80 million respectively.[313] Swift topped the list in 2016 with earnings of $170 million, and continued to appear in the top three in 2017 and 2018, earning $44 million and $80 million respectively.[314] Her 2016 earnings also topped Forbes' annual list of the 100 highest-paid celebrities\u2014a feat that entered the Guinness World Records[315]\u2014she topped the list again in 2019 with $185 million, and ranked among the top ten in 2011, 2013 and 2015.[316] In 2015, Swift became the youngest woman ever to be included on Forbes' 100 most powerful women list, ranked at number 64.[317] She was one of the finalists for Time Person of the Year in 2014, and was named so in 2017 as part of the \"Silence Breakers\" who spoke up about sexual assault.[318][319] In June 2017, Forbes estimated Swift's net worth to be $280 million.[320] The magazine later estimated it was $320 million in July 2018[321] and $360 million in June 2019.[322]\n\nOther ventures\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nSwift's philanthropic efforts have been recognized by the Do Something Awards and the Tennessee Disaster Services.[323][324] She has also received The Big Help Award for her \"dedication to helping others\" and \"inspiring others through action\",[325] and the Ripple of Hope Award because of her \"dedication to advocacy at such a young age [\u2026] Taylor is just the kind of woman we want our daughters to be\".[326] In 2008, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008.[327] Swift has performed in charity reliefs including Sydney's Sound Relief concert.[328] She also recorded a song for the Hope for Haiti Now album.[329] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV.[330] In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the United States, raising more than $750,000.[331] In 2012, Swift supported Architecture for Humanity's Restore the Shore MTV telethon in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.[332] In 2016, she made a $1,000,000 donation to Louisiana flood relief efforts and donated to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund.[333][334] In 2017, Swift made a donation to the Houston Food Bank after Hurricane Harvey.[335]\n\nSwift is a supporter of the arts and donated $75,000 to Nashville's Hendersonville High School in 2010 to help refurbish the school auditorium.[336] In 2012, she pledged $4 million to fund the building of a new education center at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville.[337] Also in 2012, Swift partnered with textbook rental company Chegg to donate $60,000 to the music departments of six US colleges.[338] Swift also promotes children's literacy.
