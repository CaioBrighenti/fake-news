The show was already renewed for season two, which will debut in the fall. NBC has upped the season two order to 18 episodes, up from 13. The series \u2014 which reunited stars Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally with creators/showrunners Max Mutchnick and David Kohan \u2014 hails from Universal Television.\n\n\u201cWill & Grace\u201d is among the more successful of the slew of series reboots in recent years. The show has averaged a solid 9.8 million viewers and 3.1 rating in the adults 18-49 demo in Nielsen\u2019s live-plus-seven ratings since its fall debut in the Thursday 9 p.m. time slot.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, we can\u2019t get enough of \u2018Will & Grace\u2019 and 23 more episodes is music to my ears,\u201d said NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt. \u201cWe\u2019re eternally grateful that Debra, Eric, Sean and Megan feel the same way and wanted to keep this good thing going. I\u2019m overwhelmed by the euphoric response the new show has received from the press and the audience, and my hat is off to the unrivaled writing team of Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, as well as the brilliant directing of Jimmy Burrows, for consistently delivering one of the best shows on television.\u201d\n\nThe season-three renewal was unveiled as cast and producers gathered Saturday night for a panel session held as part of the Paley Center for Media\u2019s Paleyfest at Los Angeles\u2019 Dolby Theatre.\n\nThe original \u201cWill & Grace\u201d ran on NBC from 1998 to 2006.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hbo-chernobyl.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10331334cg-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/chloe-dan-2nd-photo.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/conan-obrien-kumail-nanjiani.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/schitts-creek-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/9245539a-cropped-e1562834428290.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stephanieniznik.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/big-little-lies-season-2-2.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/big-little-lies-season-2-2.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nicholsfabian.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/maggie-gyllenhaal-the-deuce.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger-things.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/marc-guggenheim.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/influencer-drama-2019-james-charles-olivia-jade-something-navy.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/st3.jpeg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fwill-grace-nbc-season-3-renewal-1202729616%2F&ct=article&lob=pmc-core&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202729616&comment_count=20", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/will-and-grace.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jakeg.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/teckin-smart-power-strip-bgr.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-episode-6.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nicki-minaj-slams-fan-who-claims-shee28099d-e28098nevere28099-support-other-female-rappers-like-cardi-b-ftr.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/webp.net-resizeimage-20.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2037-_toy-story-4_-cast-explains-why-forky-isne28099t-named-sporky-youtube-f09f948a.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jacob-and-zach.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rexfeatures_10314204hj-e1561059816154.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lion-king.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/joker-movie-trailer-gq-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/cynthia_newpic.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10332596bb.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/theylive1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/will-and-grace.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/will-and-grace.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cynthia Littleton", "Business Editor", "Cynthia'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/will-grace-nbc-season-3-renewal-1202729616/", "title": "NBC Renews \u2018Will & Grace\u2019 for Season 3, Adds to Season 2 Episode Order", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "NBC has given a third season order to the \"Will &amp; Grace\" revival that has performed well for the network this season. \"Will &amp; Grace\" has been renewed for an 18-episode third season.
