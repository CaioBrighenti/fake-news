The timing seemed odd for even the hosts at The View, where Luyendyk and Burnham revealed their date -- but Kufrin isn't fazed.\n\nWhen asked by reporters during a conference call on Wednesday about her reaction to the timing of the announcement -- and Luyendyk calling it the \"perfect moment\" -- she said, \"I'm truly happy and I do wish them the best.\"\n\nThe brunette beauty also revealed that while she's been \"focused on my journey,\" she has stayed in touch with Luyendyk and Burnham \"a bit.\"\n\n\"I don't know if they'd invite me [to their wedding], but I guess, yeah, if they want me there, I'd want to share in their love, because I truly do wish them nothing but happiness,\" she shared.\n\nDuring a sitdown interview with ET's Lauren Zima, Kufrin added that Luyendyk's wedding date to Burnham is \"probably\" about one year to the date of her breakup from the race car driver. \"It doesn't bother me,\" she said of Luyendyk and Burnham's wedding plans, adding that her diplomatic responses aren't an attempt to take the high road.\n\n\"I don't think of it like that,\" she explained. \"I just want to do me, and I'm genuinely happy for them because everything played out for a reason and it happened for a reason to launch me now into this position to meet all these crazy great guys, and to truly find love again.\"\n\nKufrin had a big announcement of her own on Tuesday, as ABC confirmed that she is indeed engaged. She told ET ahead of night one filming The Bachelorette that her biggest fear was having a repeat of Luyendyk's Bachelor finale, and finding out that she wasn't the one for her final pick.\n\n\"It wasn't until I got to know the guys and realized who was genuinely here for me and the right reasons that that dissipated,\" she told reporters on Wednesday, also revealing that she had conversations with producers about possibly ending the season without a proposal.\n\n\"I was very upfront about if it's not 1,000 percent right, I don't want any party involved to feel any pressure to get down on one knee,\" she expressed.\n\nBut things did work out, and Kufrin is engaged. \"It's important to share since so many people have been on this journey with me from start to finish,\" she gushed.\n\nKufrin's season of The Bachelorettepremieres Monday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.
