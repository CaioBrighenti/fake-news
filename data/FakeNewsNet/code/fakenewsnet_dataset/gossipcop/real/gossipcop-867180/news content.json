This is my first experience around twins, and they\u2019re so different, and their personalities and they are wonderful.\u201d\n\nShe also joked that little Sir has the perfect mean mug \u201cThe boy has a stare, like a mean mug, like Jay sometimes, which is so cute, and the girl, she\u2019s just so happy all the time and so sweet. They are just adorable!\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z welcomed the twins back in June with the rapper explaining the meaning of their names during an interview with Rap Radar.\n\nRumi was named for their \u201cfavorite poet,\u201d the 13th-century Persian, while their son Sir\u2019s name came from sheer confidence: \u201cSir was like, man, come out the gate,\u201d Jay-Z said on Rap Radar. \u201cHe carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir.\u201d\n\nAnd, with the twins set to celebrate their first Christmas, Knowles-Lawson is preparing for a big family gathering with a massive meal. \u201cI\u2019m going to cook the biggest meal with everything I know how to cook. We\u2019re all going to be together and I cannot wait. It\u2019s really hard to get everyone together these days. It\u2019s becoming harder and harder!\u201d\n\nShare :", "images": ["https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-12.32.28-PM-860x860.png", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467550657/tinalead-900x600.jpg", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1158464164-860x860.jpg", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1088549752-860x860.jpg", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/the-squad-860x860.jpg", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1500019468/Beyonce twins_0_1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467550657/tinalead-900x600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.essence.com/celebrity/tina-knowles-lawson-twins-holidays/", "title": "Tina Knowles-Lawson Jokes That Sir Has A Cute \"Mean Mug\" While Talking About Beyonc\u00e9's Twins", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Mama Tina dishes on the twins' personalities and enjoying time with family during the holidays.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "<p>Tina Knowles-Lawson Dishes About Her Twin Grandchildren\u00a0And Their Personalities\u00a0</p>", "description": "Mama Tina dishes on the twins' personalities and enjoying time with family during the holidays.", "url": "https://www.essence.com/celebrity/tina-knowles-lawson-twins-holidays/", "site_name": "Essence", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467550657/tinalead-900x600.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467550657/tinalead-900x600.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/essence"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2453509358209265}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Mama Tina dishes on the twins' personalities and enjoying time with family during the holidays.", "title": "<p>Tina Knowles-Lawson Dishes About Her Twin Grandchildren\u00a0And Their Personalities\u00a0</p>", "site": "@essence", "creator": "@essence"}, "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-essence-fav-icon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.essence.com", "summary": ""}
