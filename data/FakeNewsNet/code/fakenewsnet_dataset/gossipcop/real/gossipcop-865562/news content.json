Despite reports to the contrary, the injury happened not during Infinity War but during filming for the upcoming comedy Tag. Still, Renner says, he doesn\u2019t expect his broken arms to affect filming on the upcoming superhero sequel.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t stop things that I need to do,\u201d Renner told reporters at the film festival, via The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI heal fast and am doing everything I can to heal faster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall heal up before Avengers starts up again,\u201d he added.\n\nRenner was in attendance to promote his role in Taylor Sheridan\u2019s new film Wind River, and he\u2019s currently filming Tag, a comedy based on a Wall Street Journal article about a group of friends who\u2019ve been playing an intense game of tag for the past 30 years. Ed Helms, Jon Hamm, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Annabelle Wallis, Rashida Jones, and Isla Fisher also star.\n\n\u201cI am doing a comedy that has a few stunts in,\u201d Renner told reporters. \u201cIt won\u2019t really affect my job. It affects how I get dressed in the morning \u2014 I cannot tie my shoes.\u201d\n\nImage zoom SMXRF/Star Max/GC Images\n\nProduction is already underway on Avengers: Infinity War, with a scheduled release date of May 4, 2018.
