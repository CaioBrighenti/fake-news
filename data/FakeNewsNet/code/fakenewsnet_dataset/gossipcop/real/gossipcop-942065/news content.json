The most iconic gowns of the century\u2014think: Grace Kelly\u2019s high-neck lace, Kate Middleton\u2019s modern long sleeves, Solange\u2019s minimalist cape and Bianca Jagger\u2019s bridal suiting\u2014will forever stand the test of time and, like in life, there\u2019s much to glean from history.\n\nOf course, the experts at the most renowned bridal salons in the country know a bit about that subject as they\u2019ve spent years working with the most innovative and talented designers\u2014and the most discerning brides to decide on their dream wedding day look. So whether you are searching for inspiration for your own upcoming wedding, happen to be a fashion merchandising history buff, or just love gazing at the most gorgeous dresses ever, you\u2019ll be interested to discover which designs top the best selling dresses of all time list. So we sought out the expert of experts: Mark Ingram, owner of the prestigious Mark Ingram Atelier in Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side; Dorothy Silver, Director of Merchandising, at the legendary Kleinfeld , a New York icon since 1941; and Elle Warren, Co-Owner of the tony Warren Barr\u00f3n in Dallas.\n\nThese three have been on the front lines and have much to say about their most coveted gowns and why these dresses mean to much to their brides\u2014and themselves.\n\nMark Ingram, Owner, Mark Ingram Atelier, founded in 2002, New York\n\nPinterest \u00a9DAN AND CORINA LECCA\n\nAnne Barge, style # 617\n\n\u201cWe named it \u2018Deliza\u2019 and we sold 46. We sold the first one in March 2011. It was an all-lace strapless mermaid dress that actually Anne Barge had been perfecting for years. It had a lot of style, a lot of shape. Lace was gaining in its popularity again in bridal then. Also, it was one of the first gowns with ivory lace and nude lining and it became a trend.\u201d\n\nPinterest Courtesy of Mira Zwillinger\n\nMira Zwillinger x Mark Ingram Beatrice Dress\n\n\u201cMira Zwillinger is relatively new on the scene and I was the first to have her in the United States. We met years ago when she was doing only ready-to-wear and we collaborated on a dress called the Beatrice. We sold 48 of this dress since 2013 and we are still selling it. We sold two last month. It\u2019s stunning. First of all, it\u2019s so featherweight and Mira Zwillinger is very unique in how she constructs her bodices\u2014almost like a pressed tulle that\u2019s molded to your body. It gives every bride a small waistline and the skirt is a perfect A-line shape. There\u2019s A-lines and there\u2019s A-lines. This is the A-line shape.\u201d\n\nDorothy Silver, Director of Merchandising, Kleinfeld, New York, founded in 1941\n\nPinterest Courtesy of Lazaro\n\nLazaro style #3108\n\n\u201cThis sherbert colored tulle ball gown with a beaded belt debuted in 2010. Lazaro introduced sherbert and pastel colors into bridal. We carried it in a plus size and regular size and we sold it to brides of all kinds of shapes and sizes. Brides loved it because of the simplicity of the ruched bodice and natural waist.\u201d\n\nPinterest Courtesy of Sottero and Midgley\n\nPinterest Courtesy of Sottero and Midgley\n\nSottero and Midgley, Adorae and Stella dresses\n\n\u201cKleinfeld has sold hundreds of these dresses from Sottero and Midgely by Maggie Sottero. The shape and form of these fit-and-flare dresses, plus the price point are key factors in the success of this dress.\u201d\n\nElle Warren, Co-Owner, Warren Barron, Dallas, founded in 2006\n\nPinterest Kevin Sturman / Courtesy of Vera Wang\n\nVera Wang, Gemma\n\n\u201cFor the past 10 years, Vera Wang has been the standard in the bridal industry and her Gemma gown did not disappoint. The gown features the famous \u2018Vera\u2019 mermaid fit, along with a thoughtfully draped raw-edge tulle detail\u2014bringing in a hint of that modern flare making it the perfect blend of classic and contemporary.\u201d\n\nPinterest Courtesy of Monique Lhuillier\n\nMonique Lhuillier, Severine\n\n\u201cThis is also another favorite amongst our brides. Monique is known for capturing everything feminine and romantic about bridal and Severine is no exception. The gown is a ballerina-inspired bodice covered in Alen\u00e7on lace paired with a soft blush A-line tulle skirt\u2014making it the perfect choice for all our classic brides who want that romantic look with a touch of whimsy.\u201d\n\nSee more : The Most Beautiful Celebrity Brides of All Time\n\nPinterest Courtesy of Romona Keveza\n\nPinterest Courtesy of Romona Keveza\n\n2 Romona Keveza 5-ply crepe gowns: style #RK7402 and RK6463\n\n\u201cThe new 5-ply crepe gowns by Romona Keveza come in an array of silhouettes and styles which make them appealing to many brides, while the signature 5-ply crepe gives them a rich texture\u2014taking them from simple to extraordinary. These gowns are clean with all the detail focused on the immaculate tailoring. Think: modern day Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. The underlying trait that makes brides say \u2018yes\u2019 to these dresses is that all of them complement a wide variety of body types . Tall or short, curvy or straight, all of these gowns really complement the bride to make her feel her most beautiful on her big day.
