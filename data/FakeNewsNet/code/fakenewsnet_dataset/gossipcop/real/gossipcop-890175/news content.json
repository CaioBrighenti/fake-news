They want to deliver something bigger and better than last year. I think it\u2019s going to be a fantastic season. It will be worth the wait.\u201d\n\nHolland also noted that the show will have more special effects work than previous seasons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting season, just takes a little more time,\u201d she said.\n\nEarlier this month, the show released a brief teaser featuring a commercial for the Starcourt Mall, a new addition to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n\nThe acclaimed series was nominated for five Emmys this year, including outstanding drama series, outstanding directing, and outstanding writing. Stars Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour also earned nominations for their performances, respectively.\n\nSeasons 1 and 2 are streaming now on Netflix.", "images":
