But that catapult into mega fame has drastically changed her friend group\u2014and how open she is to adding people to it, Hadid told Harper's Bazaar in its June 2017 issue. \"A lot of interesting things in friends come out,\" she said of what happened when she became famous. \"So in a way it's good because you learn that it's better to have a few really good friends than tons of friends you aren't really sure about. There are people who understand that I love them and who know that when I get back to town I'm going to call them, but sometimes I can't call every day because I'm in weird places. I've lost a lot of friends because I'll get busy for a short period of time, and they're not reaching out, but if I don't reach out, then it's like I've changed.\"\n\n\"I'm good with [the friends] I've got,\" Hadid adds.\n\nTaylor Swift, one of Hadid's besties, had nothing but glowing things to say about her friend. \"As a friend, Gigi is one of the first people I go to for advice,\" Swift wrote in an e-mail to Harper's Bazaar. \"She has this incredible ability to see all sides of a situation and simplify it for you, to see the complexity of people\u2026Gigi's #1 rule is to treat people the way she'd want to be treated, so she's on time (or early) to work, says hello to everyone on set, asks them how they are, and actually listens to their response. She is an innately kind and inclusive person who has managed to become a huge power player and businesswoman without ever compromising that.\"\n\nRead Hadid's full interview and see her entire space-themed NASA shoot here, at Harper's Bazaar.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/20/980x490/landscape-1494853364-hbz-june-july-2017-gigi-cover-09-1494617478.jpg?resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/20/980x490/landscape-1494853364-hbz-june-july-2017-gigi-cover-09-1494617478.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey", "News", "Strategy Editor", "Alyssa Bailey Is The News", "Strategy Editor At Elle.Com", "Where She Oversees Coverage Of Celebrities", "Royals", "Particularly Meghan Markle", "Kate Middleton ."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a45278/gigi-hadid-june-harpers-bazaar-interview/", "title": "Gigi Hadid Doesn't Have Time for New Friends", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Gigi Hadid Doesn't Have Time for New Friends", "description": "The model opens up on how fame has changed her squad and the way she views friendship.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a45278/gigi-hadid-june-harpers-bazaar-interview/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/20/980x490/landscape-1494853364-hbz-june-july-2017-gigi-cover-09-1494617478.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-03-19 05:22:42", "published_time": "2017-05-15 01:34:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/20/980x490/landscape-1494853364-hbz-june-july-2017-gigi-cover-09-1494617478.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Gigi Hadid on Why She Wants No New Friends - Taylor Swift on Gigi Hadid for Harper's Bazaar", "description": "The model opens up on how fame has changed her squad and the way she views friendship.", "keywords": "gigi hadid,taylor swift", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/20/480x480/square-1494853364-hbz-june-july-2017-gigi-cover-09-1494617478.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture,celebrities,gigi hadid,taylor swift", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-15T13:34:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/20/980x490/landscape-1494853364-hbz-june-july-2017-gigi-cover-09-1494617478.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/20/480x480/square-1494853364-hbz-june-july-2017-gigi-cover-09-1494617478.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Gigi Hadid Doesn't Have Time for New Friends", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494826440.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
