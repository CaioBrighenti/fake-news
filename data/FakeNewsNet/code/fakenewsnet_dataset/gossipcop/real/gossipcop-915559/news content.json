racist poison pen letter containing white powder was allegedly posted to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\n\nPolice are investigating the suspect package, treating it as a \"racist hate crime\", after it was sent to St James\u2019 Palace last week.\n\nThe letter was opened by a member of staff and intercepted before it reached the Prince and Ms Markle, with specialist officers called in to investigate.\n\nTests confirmed that the powder was harmless, with the couple informed about what had happened.\n\nThe episode will likely leave members of the Royal Household deeply concerned about security ahead of the Royal wedding on May 19th, with the couple due to make several public appearances before then.", "images":
