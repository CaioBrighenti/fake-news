Franken was a writer and performer on the NBC sketch comedy show primarily from 1975 to 1995.\n\n\"What Al did was stupid and foolish, and we think it was appropriate for him to apologize ...,\" the letter said. However, it continued, \"after years of working with him, we would like to acknowledge that not one of us ever experienced any inappropriate behavior; and mention our sincere appreciation that he treated each one of us with the utmost respect and regard.\"", "images": ["https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/lat_icons/app-bar-logo.svg?v=36", "https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/tinygif.gif", "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/Z_7DIKcjsVj9vpm6aOvDLBYWNao=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5a15a98c/turbine/la-lb-media-melissa-schuman-nick-carter-20171122-084457/900"], "top_img": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/Z_7DIKcjsVj9vpm6aOvDLBYWNao=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5a15a98c/turbine/la-lb-media-melissa-schuman-nick-carter-20171122-084457/900", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christie D'Zurilla", "Mark Ruffalo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-nick-carter-accused-of-rape-by-dream-1511368853-htmlstory.html", "title": "Nick Carter, accused of rape by Dream singer Melissa Schuman, is 'shocked and saddened'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "language": "English (United States), en-US", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2018 Los Angeles Times", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "date": "2017-11-22T17:55:00Z", "googlebot-news": "index", "twitter": {"title": "Nick Carter, accused of rape by Dream singer Melissa Schuman, is 'shocked and saddened'", "image": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/Z_7DIKcjsVj9vpm6aOvDLBYWNao=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5a15a98c/turbine/la-lb-media-melissa-schuman-nick-carter-20171122-084457/900", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@latimes", "creator": "@latimes"}, "fb_title": "Nick Carter, accused of rape by Dream singer Melissa Schuman, is 'shocked and saddened'", "og": {"url": "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-nick-carter-accused-of-rape-by-dream-1511368853-htmlstory.html", "title": "Nick Carter, accused of rape by Dream singer Melissa Schuman, is 'shocked and saddened'", "image": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/Z_7DIKcjsVj9vpm6aOvDLBYWNao=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5a15a98c/turbine/la-lb-media-melissa-schuman-nick-carter-20171122-084457/900", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "latimes.com", "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "tag": "la-et-entertainment-news-updates-november-2017, Music, Celebrity", "section": "Entertainment"}, "fb": {"app_id": 119932621434123, "page_id": 5863113009}, "author": "Christie D'Zurilla", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkidJ4QTH5SBKRCBDAWCP3Y66QUHWA", "test": "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-nick-carter-accused-of-rape-by-dream-1511368853-htmlstory.html", "ptype": "s"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.latimes.com", "summary": ""}
