Now, RadarOnline.com has learned the cause of his death.\n\nThe Chester County Coroner\u2019s Office told the site in a statement, \u201cThe cause of death was fentanyl, heroin and ethanol intoxication, with the manner of death being accidental.\u201d\n\nLancaster had a few arrests over the years related to alcohol and drugs, but his mother Carol told Radar last month that she believed he was sober at the time of his death and had died of heart failure.\n\nBrian was 23 when he appeared on \u201cRoad Rules\u201d in 1999.\n\nAfter the show, he got his master's degree in elementary education.\n\nHe is survived by his fianc\u00e9e Sarah and his parents, Dennis and Carol.\n\nIn his obituary, Lancaster was described as \"a spiritual explorer, dreamy stargazer, inquisitive world traveler and barstool philosopher who enjoyed a good mind meld.\u201d\n\nThe obituary added, \"Brian enjoyed the outdoors and was known in different circles as a tall-taled fisherman, free skier extraordinaire, daredevil skateboarder and ferocious backyard gardener. He loved being in nature and had a way with all living beings, making him somewhat of an animal whisperer.\"", "images": ["https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/iggy-azalea-carti-backgrid-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/05/16/elle-fanning-mega-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/kim-basinger-510x600.jpg", "http://warnerbros.112.2o7.net/b/ss/wbrosshowextra/1/JS-1.5.1--NS/s1562998943?AQB=1&ce=UTF-8&ns=warnerbros&pageName=articles%3Aarticle%3A%3Areality-star-brian-lancastera-s-cause-of-death-revealed&c1=Extra.us&v1=Extra.us&c2=article&v2=article&c3=articles&v3=articles&events=event6&AQE=1", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/05/11/scott-hutchison-frightened-rabbit-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/05/30/brian-lancaster-fb-825x580.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/cameron-boyce-insta-300x211.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000013&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/02/28/ed-sheeran-cherry-seaborn-insta-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/04/12/gettyimages-1141083562-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/10/extra-morningsave-sidebar-hp-placement-300x190-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/kumail-nanjiani-abc-1-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/06/24/mary-j-blige-splash-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/10/john-f-kennedy-jr-carolyn-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/diane-keaton-splash-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/michael-strahan-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/billy-eichner-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/02/22/r-kelly-getty-510x600.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/02/28/ed-sheeran-cherry-seaborn-insta-825x580.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2017/05/05/jack-schlossberg-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/05/07/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-getty-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/05/30/brian-lancaster-fb-1200x630.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/04/02/blac-chyna-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/04/05/brian-lancaster-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/09/05/christopher-lawford-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/05/29/blake-painter-discovery-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/08/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-backgrid-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/06/18/demi-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/11/nikki-bella-artem-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/larissa-lima-mega-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/06/26/kylie-insta-380x447.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.extratv.com/2018/05/30/brian-lancaster-fb-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://extratv.com/2018/05/30/reality-star-brian-lancasters-cause-of-death-revealed/", "title": "Reality Star Brian Lancaster\u2019s Cause of Death Revealed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"extratv": 15676578, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@extratv", "title": "Reality Star Brian Lancaster\u2019s Cause of Death Revealed", "description": "Former MTV \u201cRoad Rules\u201d star Brian Lancaster was just 43 years old when he passed away in Pennsylvania in March.
