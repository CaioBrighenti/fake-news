In June, Davidson got a tattoo of a black bunny mask, which looks similar to an accessory Grande wore on the cover art for her last album Dangerous Woman, and the initials \u201cAG\u201d on his hand.\n\nRELATED: Meet the Teens Who Were Born After Their Fathers Died on 9/11\n\nImage zoom Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande Robert Kamau/GC Images; Robert Kamau/GC Images\n\nImage zoom Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande Robert Kamau/GC Images\n\nDavidson also enlisted Jon Mesa \u2014 a tattoo artist and co-owner of Chinatown\u2019s No Idols Tattoo Shop \u2014 to cover up an inking of his ex-girlfriend Cazzie David\u2018s face.\n\n\u201cI did a huge coverup [adding a forest of trees],\u201d Mesa told New York Post\u2018s Page Six, adding, \u201cAfter we were done, I told Pete, \u2018Hey, dude, let\u2019s just stop with the girlfriend tats until after [Grande\u2019s] your wife.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe tattoo artist continued, \u201cRelationships come and go, and Pete is a really young man. I think that went in one ear and out the other.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jawad Elatab/SplashNews.com\n\nThe newly engaged couple, who have been packing on the PDA lately, were photographed locking lips in New York City while out on a shopping trip on Friday.\n\nThe pair have been spending time together in the Big Apple amid Davidson\u2019s break from Saturday Night Live. Grande, meanwhile, is weeks away from the release of her new album, Sweetener, on Aug. 17.\n\nThey\u2019ve also reportedly moved into a new apartment together, bringing their romance to an over-the-top luxury building in Manhattan.\n\nOn Thursday, they were spotted kissing again while they were out shopping with friends.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed Davidson and Grande\u2019s whirlwind engagement on June 11, just weeks after they began dating in May. Then, Davidson confirmed the engagement while making an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\n\u201cI feel like I won a contest, so sick,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cIt\u2019s f\u2014ing lit, Jimmy. It\u2019s so lit.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ariana-a.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630",
