I was trapped inside my own body. My throat hurt like hell. I looked down and I had all these tubes coming out of my mouth.\n\nSo I panicked.\n\nI started trying to pull them out, but I couldn\u2019t because my hands were so weak. The nurses came running in to stop me. You ever had a really bad dream, where you\u2019re trying to run away from a monster or some shit, and you just can\u2019t run? Your legs don\u2019t work like they should, and the monster is coming right behind you, and it\u2019s like you\u2019re in slow motion. That\u2019s what it felt like.\n\nI was laying there, looking up at the ceiling, and the doctors kept coming in and standing over me and saying some stuff. Then they\u2019d leave. Then they\u2019d come back. Leave, come back. Leave again, come back again. Or maybe I was just going in and out of sleep.\n\nMy ex-wife was there in the room with me. After all the shit I had done, I was surprised to see her. Honestly, that\u2019s when I knew that I was probably in bad shape.\n\nAt some point, the main doctor came in and told me what had happened. He said, \u201cMr. Odom, you\u2019ve been in a coma for the last four days. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t talk. So I just nodded.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that you\u2019re here. We didn\u2019t think you were going to make it.\u201d\n\nI was in total shock. Couldn\u2019t say any clever shit back. Couldn\u2019t ask questions. It was the first time in my life that I felt helpless. I felt like I was two inches tall. It was just \u2026 it was real.\n\nAt that point in my life, I was doing coke every day. Pretty much every second of free time that I had, I was doing coke. I couldn\u2019t control it.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to control it.\n\nI remember sitting there in bed, and for the first time in my life I couldn\u2019t talk my way out of the situation. I was trapped all day in my own thoughts. And I kept thinking about something that my grandmother used to say to me when I was a kid.\n\nI could see her face, like she was right there in the room.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s done in the dark,\u201d she would say, \u201cwill come out in the light.\u201d\n\nI think of all the sneaky shit I tried to get away with. All the times I did wrong. All the stuff I tried to hide. If it\u2019s not in the public light, it\u2019s in God\u2019s light.\n\nI was laying there in that bed, hooked up to all these machines, people all around me crying, and there was no running from it anymore. It was like God was telling me, \u201cWhatever the fuck you think you\u2019re doing, you need to slow down. Or it\u2019s gonna be worse than this.\u201d\n\nOnly one thing worse than this.\n\nNathaniel S. Butler/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nRick James said it best.\n\n\u201cCocaine is a hell of a drug.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a hell of a drug.\n\nIt will make you do things you never thought you\u2019d do. It will turn you into a different person. It will put you in situations where you say to yourself, \u201cHow the fuck did I get here?\u201d\n\nWhen I was in that hospital bed, I kept asking myself that question. And I kept thinking about all the people in my life who aren\u2019t here anymore. Mostly, I thought about my mother. My dad wasn\u2019t really around when I was a kid. He had his own problems with addiction. But my mother was my best friend in the world. She was just so caring. My first memory in life is hearing the sound of her voice. She had these really wide eyes and a real soft voice.\n\nIf we were at a family party everybody would ask me, \u201cLamar, where\u2019s your mother? Where\u2019s Cathy? Where\u2019s Cathy?\u201d\n\nShe was like the center of the universe in Jamaica, Queens.\n\nLinda Cataffo/NY Daily News/Getty Images\n\nI remember when I started playing peewee football, I was already big as hell. I could take care of myself. But I got hit on this one play, and I was just dinged up a little bit. I\u2019m on the ground for six seconds or seven seconds max, and just as I\u2019m about to get up, I hear my mom\u2019s voice. She\u2019s running from the sideline out onto the field. Sprinting, yelling, \u201cMookah! Mookah! Talk to me, baby!\u201d\n\nThat was her nickname for me.\n\nShe gets to me and I\u2019m like, \u201cMom, what are you doing? Are you crazy?\u201d\n\nI mean, this is New York City. Everybody\u2019s looking at me like, Yo. Come on, man.\n\nShe says, \u201cMookah, Mookah, are you O.K.? What hurts?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m fine. Get the hell off the field!\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s like, \u201cO.K.! O.K.! I\u2019m going! I just gotta make sure you\u2019re alright.\u201d\n\nThen she went back to the sidelines like it was nothing. That was my mother. She always had my back.\n\nWhen I was 12 years old, she got sick. I knew she had colon cancer, but I didn\u2019t really know how bad it was. She kind of kept it from me to protect me. I just remember that she went into the hospital for a while, and when I went to visit her, it seemed like she was getting \u2026 smaller. Like she was disappearing, you know what I mean?\n\nOne day, when my grandmother was driving me home from the hospital, she said, \u201cYou know, your mother is probably going to pass away soon. I just want you to be ready.\u201d\n\nThe day that she passed away, I remember going to see her, and I remember how the cancer had just ravaged her body. Like if I could go back to that time, and you could put me in that room, I probably wouldn\u2019t even recognize who she was. Her face was so small and she was bleeding out of her mouth. And she kept saying \u201cMookah, Mookah\u2026.\u201d\n\nI just sat right next to her bed, and one of the last things she said to me \u2026 I still think about it every day.\n\nShe said, \u201cBe nice to everybody, Mook.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think anything can prepare you for losing your mother at 12 years old. It leaves a mark on you. I don\u2019t care how strong you think you are.\n\nOtto Greule Jr./Getty Images\n\nThe only reason I was able to get through that time was because of my grandmother, and because of basketball. Those two things protected me. On the day my mother died, I went straight to the park to play ball. It was all I wanted to do. It was an escape for me.\n\nI remember the news had started to get around the neighborhood about my mom, and people started showing up at the court. Then more people. After a while, the whole block was out there with me.\n\nI had this feeling, like, It\u2019s gonna be alright. Your grandmother has your back. Your neighborhood has your back. God has your back.\n\nSo go on. Get on with it. Keep going \u2019til you get your suit and you shake that old man\u2019s hand.\n\nSee, I used to have this vision in my head, from the time I was 10 years old. I could already see David Stern up at the podium calling my name, saying what team I was going to, and me kissing my family. I could already see it.\n\nYou might think that being a kid from New York City, with drugs around all the time, that my problems started a long time ago. Or that they started when I got drafted by Los Angeles. But that wasn\u2019t the case. I never wanted to touch anything stronger than marijuana. I definitely never touched cocaine. I actually looked down on it.\n\nI didn\u2019t try it until I was 24 years old, when I was on summer vacation in Miami. And \u2026 I wish I could tell you there was a reason for it. There wasn\u2019t. It was just an asinine decision I made. If I knew that it was going to affect my life the way it did, I would\u2019ve never even thought about it. Never. But I did it. It turned out to be a life-altering decision.\n\nRight around that same time, my grandmother passed away. I lost a lot of family members in a short period of time. When I did coke, I felt good for a minute. I stopped having so much anxiety. I didn\u2019t think about the pain. I didn\u2019t think about death. So I kept doing it more and more, but I was still in control. It wasn\u2019t like an everyday thing.\n\nJeff Gross/Getty Images\n\nThen, about two years later, I got a phone call that changed my life. It was the summer of 2006. I had been out partying all night, and I hadn\u2019t gone home.\n\nMy son Jayden was six months old at the time. He was at home in his crib. I should\u2019ve been at home with him. But I was out, doing whatever.\n\nEarly in the morning, I got a call from his mother. She was panicking. I was like, \u201cYo, calm down. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\nAnd she said, \u201cJayden \u2026 he won\u2019t wake up.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cHe won\u2019t wake up?\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cYeah, the ambulance is here. They\u2019re taking him now.\u201d\n\nI was in Manhattan. I had to drive all the way to Long Island. When I got to the hospital, the doctors just told me that, you know, \u201cHe\u2019s not responding.\u201d\n\nThey said, \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cGone? What are you talking about? I just seen him. Gone?\u201d\n\nMan, my son was vivacious. Real lively. Whenever I used to walk into a room, he would just like \u2026 look at me, and stare. Of course, he couldn\u2019t talk, but he just used to stare. He used to use his eyes a lot \u2014 let me know that he kinda understood. Like, Yeah, that\u2019s my dad. What\u2019s up, Dad?\n\nI just seen him. Gone? How the fuck is that even possible? How can he be gone?\n\nI walked into the hospital room \u2026 and the hurt on his mother\u2019s face, I\u2019ll never forget that. How she couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nSix months old. Gone.\n\nHe\u2019d be 11 now.\n\nIcon SMI\n\nI used to think about what he would look like if he was still here. Actually, I still think about it almost every day.\n\nThe doctors told us that the cause was sudden infant death syndrome. It almost sounded made-up. No explanation. No answers. Just \u2026 gone. Like that. And you\u2019re supposed to just accept it. You\u2019re supposed to live with that.\n\nI think everything probably picked up at that point, with the drugs. Even subconsciously. You don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re doing it at that point. I think subconsciously, you make yourself an addict because of the trauma that you\u2019re going through.\n\nWith cocaine especially, there\u2019s a high, and then an emotional low. So it\u2019s like a roller coaster. You go high, and then you go low. High, low, high, low. After you do it, you feel shame. You think about all the reasons why you shouldn\u2019t have done it. Then the cycle starts again.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t understand. Anybody who\u2019s lived a complicated, drug-infused life like I\u2019ve lived knows the cycle \u2014 with women, cheating on my wife, shit like that. Nights when I should have been asleep. Nights when I stayed up sniffing coke. Lot of those nights. When your heart is beating fast. When you should know better. When you\u2019re just riding that roller coaster, man.\n\nYou think I wasn\u2019t feeling shame? You think I was blind to what I was doing?\n\nNah, I wasn\u2019t blind to it. Shame \u2026 pain. It\u2019s part of the whole cycle. My brain was broken. As the years went on, and I got into my 30s, my career was winding down, and things just got out of control.\n\nWhen I was like 32, 33 \u2026 I just wanted to get high all the time. That\u2019s it, just get high. And things got dark as hell.\n\nNoah Graham/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nOne of the darkest places I\u2019ve ever been was when I was in a motel room, getting high with this chick, and my wife (at the time) walked in. That probably was like rock bottom.\n\nFirst of all I was in a motel.\n\nA motel.\n\nI\u2019m a millionaire. I\u2019d made it out of Jamaica, Queens, and won two NBA titles. And I\u2019m in a motel, with some random person, doing coke. But I just wanted to get high with this girl, and I had no other place to go. I couldn\u2019t take her home. You know, I was being a scumbag. Nothing else I got for that. No excuses. No bullshit. That\u2019s just the truth.\n\nMy dick and my habit took me down all the roads that you don\u2019t ever wanna go down. A lot of great men are fools to that. Fools to that. There are probably a lot of young dudes out there who hear my story and think that it could never happen to them. That they\u2019re untouchable.\n\nMan \u2026 Nobody is untouchable. Nobody in this life is immune to pain.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s crazy, because my uncle Mike was a correction\u2019s officer at Riker\u2019s Island. He was a tough motherfucker. He was that uncle who used to lift his shirt up when I was in middle school and be like, \u201cYou think you\u2019re tough? Go ahead. Give me your best shot. Hard as you can.\u201d\n\nWham. I\u2019d hit him full-force, and it wouldn\u2019t even faze him.\n\nThey used to have a family night for all the guards and C.O.\u2019s at Riker\u2019s like once a month, and he used to take me along with him. I was always so intrigued by the inmates, because they were some geniuses, for real. Uncle Mike would take me to this room where they had all the confiscated weapons that these dudes would make. If you gave these guys a toothpick, they\u2019d find a way to make it into a weapon. They\u2019d take parts from the toilet or an alarm clock and sharpen it into a shank.\n\nI remember having this realization when I was looking at the stuff they used to make: These guys were smart as hell. Some of these dudes could have been engineers. How the hell did they get here?\n\nI told myself that I\u2019d never go to prison. I\u2019d never mess up like that.\n\nBut you know what? Life is a lot harder than you think it\u2019s gonna be.\n\nWhen you\u2019re an addict, nothing can get through to you. I never thought I was going to die. I never thought I\u2019d be in a coma. I didn\u2019t think I had a problem. But then I woke up in a bed with tubes coming out of my mouth \u2014 and it was real.\n\nThe doctors told me that right before I woke up from the coma, my kids had come by to see me. And that broke my heart, because I had seen my own mother on her deathbed, with tubes coming out of her mouth.\n\nMy kids are the only things that kept me going. I\u2019ve been a big strong dude my whole life, so anytime my kids see me in a weak point like that is definitely hard for me \u2014 even to talk about now.\n\nSteve Granitz/WireImage\n\nMy son Lamar Jr. is 16. He\u2019s shy and loves basketball. Like me reincarnated. Only a more handsome version.\n\nMy daughter, Destiny, is 18. She\u2019s beautiful and smart. And she doesn\u2019t take any shit. When I was able to talk again, she told me straight up, \u201cDad, you need to get yourself help or I\u2019m not going to talk to you again.\u201d\n\nSo I went to rehab, and in rehab you learn to submit to everything. I\u2019ve always been a really anxious person. I\u2019ve been a worrier my whole life. But I\u2019m learning to release everything. Or at least I\u2019m trying to learn.\n\nMy kids even came to a few therapy sessions with me. And that was especially important, because they got to kind of let loose, telling me how my addiction affected them, too.\n\nAfter one of the sessions, my daughter told me, \u201cThis was good, but I don\u2019t ever want you to be in here again.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sober now. But it\u2019s an everyday struggle. I have an addiction. I\u2019ll always have an addiction. It never goes away. I mean, I want to get high right now. But I know that I can\u2019t if I want to be here for my children.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s crazy \u2026 when I was in the hospital, and I couldn\u2019t even walk, all these people came to see me that I hadn\u2019t seen in a minute. All these old teammates came. Kobe came. I got texts from all these guys, like, \u201cDamn dog, the news was saying you were dead. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\nIt kind of reminded me of who I was, and what I\u2019ve meant to some people.\n\nI shook hands with death. But you know what? Ain\u2019t no coming back from that. Even though my funeral would probably be a good funeral, and there\u2019d probably be a lot of people who hadn\u2019t seen each other in a long time. But it ain\u2019t time for that yet.\n\nWalter Iooss Jr./The Players' Tribune\n\nI still got my kids. I\u2019m still here. And damn, I\u2019m still pretty handsome.\n\nI\u2019ve been through so much that now I just want that little piece in the world \u2026 that little piece \u2026 where I don\u2019t have to worry.\n\nEvery morning when I wake up, I look at the same pictures.\n\nPictures of people who are gone. My mother. My grandmother. My son Jayden. My best friend Jamie.\n\nPeople who are still here. My two beautiful kids.\n\nI just look at their faces for a few minutes, and it\u2019s like a reminder of what life is supposed to be about. I feel warm. I feel an energy. I feel love. That shit gets me through the day.\n\nIt\u2019s like taking my vitamins.\n\n", "images": ["https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/Odom-Drugs-Pull.jpg?width=1000", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/GettyImages-652261860.jpg?width=1000", "https://storage.googleapis.com/www-theplayerstribune-com/uploads/Lamar-Odom-sig.png", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/forward.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/www-theplayerstribune-com/uploads/LAMAR-ODOM.jpg", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/a95a2ae9-59211020113466_rockets_at_lakers.jpg?width=1440", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/GettyImages-492662720a.jpg?width=1000", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/flags/Global.png", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/tpt-logo-thetribune.svg", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/flags/US.png", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/apostrophe_footer.png", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/check.svg", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/ic_search_white_24px.svg", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/GettyImages-6310711.jpg?width=1000", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/GettyImages-88190249.jpg?width=1000", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/tpt-logo-players.svg", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/GettyImages-392771.jpg?width=1000", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/static/images/ic_menu_white_24px.svg", "https://cdn.theplayerstribune.com/uploads/01_PlayersTribune_02871.jpg?width=1000"], "top_img": "https://storage.googleapis.com/www-theplayerstribune-com/uploads/LAMAR-ODOM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lamar Odom"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/lamar-odom-done-in-the-dark", "title": "Done in the Dark", "meta_data": {"description": "When I woke up in the hospital room in Nevada, I couldn\u2019t move.
