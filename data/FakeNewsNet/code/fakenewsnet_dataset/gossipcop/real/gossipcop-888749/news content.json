In an interview on The Howard Stern Show, Jeffrey Dean Morgan revealed that costar Andrew Lincoln accidentally broke his nose during while they were acting out a climactic fistfight between Negan and Rick for a scene in last December\u2019s mid-season finale.\n\n\u201cI knew immediately, when the scene started and the cameras started rolling, that we were too close to each other,\u201d Morgan, who plays Negan, told Stern. \u201cWe\u2019re toe-to-toe. I punch, he punches, and neither of us moves. We\u2019re both taking punches, you know what I mean? And on like the second punch, he just cracked me on the bridge of my nose. I think I dropped to a knee. But immediately, when you get hit in the nose, your eyes water. I stood up and I was like \u2018Uh, dude.\u2019 He was more upset than I was!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Gene Page/AMC\n\nMorgan previously told EW (see the video above) that one of his favorite things about playing the villainous Negan is watching the other cast members\u2019 reactions to his character\u2019s sadism \u2014 especially Lincoln.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m doing my job the more mad Andy Lincoln gets,\u201d Morgan told EW. \u201cSo if off camera he\u2019s screaming and swearing in between takes, I know that me and Negan are doing our job, and I\u2019ve gotten him pretty riled up. And then, of course, I have to go up and apologize and we go back to being friends between takes. But it\u2019s been intense, and that is fun.\u201d\n\nHear more of Morgan\u2019s interview with Stern above. The Walking Dead season finale airs this Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on AMC.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/twd_808_gp_0802_0127-rt.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/bts-season-5-reedus-lincoln-laugh.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2698px%2C1417px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/twd_408_gp_0730_0497-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C277px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/twd_905_jld_0620_03956_rt.jpg?crop=0px%2C211px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/twd_808_gp_0802_0127-rt.jpg?crop=0px%2C87px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/twd_509_gp_0819_0110.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/sn119-006c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6eeced293de3b25cebd3d7472270c707?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/twd_808_gp_0802_0127-rt.jpg?crop=0px%2C87px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christian Holub"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/09/andrew-lincoln-broke-jeffrey-dean-morgan-nose-walking-dead/", "title": "The Walking Dead: Andrew Lincoln broke Jeffrey Dean Morgan's nose", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Andrew Lincoln,Jeffrey Dean Morgan", "news_keywords": "Andrew Lincoln,Jeffrey Dean Morgan", "description": "Rick and Negan's fight during 'How It's Gotta Be' apparently got a little too real.", "og": {"title": "Andrew Lincoln broke Jeffrey Dean Morgan's nose during a 'Walking Dead' fight", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/09/andrew-lincoln-broke-jeffrey-dean-morgan-nose-walking-dead/", "description": "If the fights on\u00a0The Walking Dead look intense and realistic, well, that's because sometimes they actually are.
