Instead, in order to honor her commitment to the awards show, she apparently decided to perform the interpretative dance.\n\nAt a show that saw Kendrick Lamar sing with someone who literally set themselves on fire, and Shawn Mendes turning on the charm in a rendition of his hit song \u201cThere\u2019s Nothing Holding Me Back,\u201d Lorde\u2019s performance definitely stood out, and not really in a good way. It seemed odd and perhaps underwhelming, especially since her album Melodrama sparked so much excitement and garnered critical praise earlier this year.\n\nBut considering the circumstances, it\u2019s impressive that Lorde performed at all.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64721771/GettyImages_157527152.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64722028/869480766.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64721025/1478617763_et_phone_home.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64716839/Screen_Shot_2019_07_13_at_11.45.48_AM.7.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64722501/GettyImages_1155382545.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0cMTWVHuaFi91Ff9z-JneZ7lqZs=/0x0:3168x1782/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56389259/839997484.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64722635/GettyImages_1155408293.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0cMTWVHuaFi91Ff9z-JneZ7lqZs=/0x0:3168x1782/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56389259/839997484.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aug"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2017/8/27/16212692/mtv-vma-2017-lorde-performance-flu", "title": "VMA 2017: Lorde had the flu.
