Don\u2019t forget to subscribe for more exclusive interviews and photos, only in EW.\n\nHayley Mills had no idea she\u2019d won an Oscar until it arrived on her doorstep. At 14, the actress nabbed the Academy\u2019s last juvenile award \u2014 a special prize, first given in 1935, for child performers like Shirley Temple and Judy Garland \u2014 for her turn as the perpetually sunny heroine of Pollyanna. But not only did she miss the 1961 ceremony, she didn\u2019t realize it had occurred at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t know very much about the Oscars,\u201d Mills admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t know very much about anything, really. So it was all a big surprise.\u201d\n\nOf course, Mills has a much clearer understanding now, at 71, of what her achievement meant. Here, she looks back on her early career, the moment she received her Oscar, and where the trophy \u2014 a miniature version of the statuette \u2014 went.\n\nImage zoom Loomis Dean/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Pollyanna was the first of six features you made with Walt Disney. What do you think now of your performances as a child actor?\n\nHAYLEY MILLS: The majority of the movies that I made when I was a child [were] very well-written. I worked with wonderful, experienced actors and actresses and excellent directors. If you can\u2019t turn in a halfway decent performance with that kind of support around you, obviously you aren\u2019t supposed to be doing it. I started acting at a time when children were younger. Television wasn\u2019t such a big thing, there were no iPhones or iPods or computers, and we stayed living in our imaginations as children. I don\u2019t think we grew up as quickly. So [acting] was just a short step from the games I played, the imaginary games which all children do.\n\nDo you have any fond memories of your time on Pollyanna?\n\nMaking Pollyanna was a wonderful experience. I\u2019d made one movie before in England, and we shot a lot of it on location in Wales, and it was terribly cold. It was what I was familiar with. It was England. And suddenly I found myself for the first time in my life in not just California, but Hollywood, and that had a huge impact. I was there with my mother and my little brother, and to be on Walt Disney\u2019s studios, that was, you know, I didn\u2019t really have that much to compare it with.\n\nWe stayed in the famous Chateau Marmont hotel in those little cabins and looked down over Sunset Boulevard. I spent most of my time I think in Schwab\u2019s, the pharmacy, sitting on those stools and having ice cream sodas and hot fudge sundaes, and getting carried away by all the comics. Walt Disney took us to Disneyland and we stayed there overnight, and my brother who was 9 at the time decided that he wanted to live in Disneyland and we had great difficulty dragging him out. California and Hollywood in those days, it was magic for a child.\n\nImage zoom Buena Vista/Getty Images\n\nYou worked with Oscar winners on that set, including Jane Wyman (above) and Karl Malden.\n\nI remember Jane Wyman with enormous affection. She was warm and sweet and kind and lovely to me. And Karl Malden used to make me laugh a lot. He always said, when we did a scene together, the scene was about our two noses, because I had \u2014 and still have [laughs] \u2014 not the most aristocratic nose in the business, and neither did Karl.\n\nWatch the full episode of Hollywood\u2019s Greatest Untold Stories now on PeopleTV.

And my boots were very new and stiff, and my clothes was itchy, and all I could think about really was how desperately I wanted to get to the catering truck because down the hill, there it was. I\u2019d never seen such amazing looking American food, and I was distracted to say the least. They didn\u2019t get a single shot in the can in the morning.\n\nThey did eventually \u2014 and you went on to win the juvenile Oscar. At the ceremony, Annette Funicello accepted the trophy on your behalf from Shirley Temple. Do you remember why you couldn\u2019t make it to the show?\n\nI was actually at boarding school in England, and I didn\u2019t know anything about it until it turned up. Like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s sweet. What\u2019s that?\u201d I was told, \u201cWell, this is a very special award,\u201d but it was quite a few years before I began to appreciate what I had.\n\nWhen did that finally happen?\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t until the 75th Oscar ceremony, where I was one of the [former] winners on stage. The curtains parted, and I found myself staring out at the Kodak Theatre, and I looked straight at Richard Gere and [Martin] Scorsese, and nearly fainted. I thought, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m actually a part of this!\u201d I hadn\u2019t ever felt that connection, and it was extraordinary. My heroes were on that stage with me, and I was considered to be one of their number!\n\nWhere is your Oscar now?\n\nI\u2019m terribly embarrassed to say this, because it looks so careless, but it has disappeared. In the late \u201980s, I came to California to do a television series [Good Morning, Miss Bliss]. When I came back from that first year, my little statuette had disappeared, and I never found it. And you know, it\u2019s not something you can replace. They\u2019ve broken the mold. I spoke to the Academy, and I said, \u201cWell, look, give me a big one then!\u201d [Laughs] They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d But I\u2019d say for 25 years it was on the mantelpiece in my drawing room, and I was always very proud of it.\n\nAt the time, how did winning the Oscar affect the way you viewed your career? Did it change the way you viewed it at all?\n\nIt didn\u2019t change the way I viewed my career, and maybe that was one of the reasons why my parents decided A, not to tell me about it, and B, therefore, not to send me or let me go to the ceremony, because I was very young\u2026 It\u2019s part of their attitude towards me when I was a child, [that] I should be kept as unaffected by the world that I was now moving in as possible. So, I went off to my boarding school, and when I came back from making a movie in Hollywood, I went back to boarding school.\n\nAfter Pollyanna, you went on to make more hits like The Parent Trap, before successfully transitioning into adult parts. You\u2019re now in the Off-Broadway play Party Face. Why did you want to continue acting after being a child star?\n\nGosh, I started acting when I was 12, and I was very, very lucky to be in wonderful films, and it set me on a path which I am very grateful for. It wasn\u2019t always clear to me where I should go, and where the path was leading. Once I started becoming an adolescent and then moving into the adulthood and dealing with life on very, very different levels, there were times where it got confusing and I lost my bearings and I didn\u2019t know who I was was or what I should do or what parts I should play or if I should give it up altogether. When my first son was born, I decided that I would give it up, and I didn\u2019t work for over a year, and then a very interesting little movie came along and I went, \u201cOooh I\u2019d love to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd then I brought my then-1-year-old son with me on location, and it was miserable for him. It was in the middle of winter in the north of England, and it rained constantly. He was stuck in the trailer, there was mud up to here [gestures] and [I thought], \u201cWhat am I doing to my little boy?\u201d [Laughs] But this is what I do, and I realized that I\u2019m just, I\u2019m not equipped to do anything else.\n\nI\u2019m very good at being out of work. [Laughs] I\u2019ve got four grandchildren now, and that\u2019s an amazing, fabulous experience, and I can\u2019t wait to see them all again, and the fact that I\u2019m still working at this age is extraordinary, you know? I am so surprised and so grateful that I am still paying the bills by doing this! Every job one does, you learn more and more and more, and of course the irony is that the older one gets and the more experience you\u2019ve had as an actress, the better you get, and the fewer the parts there are to pour all you\u2019ve learned into them\u2026 But, you know, if you\u2019re still reasonably compos mentis and healthy, you have a lot to offer as an actor, so I\u2019m very lucky.\n\nMills is now appearing off-Broadway in Party Face on Stage II at City Center through Apr 8, 2018.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1148924365.jpg",
