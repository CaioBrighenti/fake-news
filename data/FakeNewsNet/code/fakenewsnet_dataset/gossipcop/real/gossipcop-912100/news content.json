She's already revealed that she wants to incorporate her beloved pooches into the ceremony, and that she may or may not have multiple ceremonies worldwide . Next up, Hilton is starting to brainstorm her wedding day look(s). And, yes, unsurprisingly, there will apparently be multiple.\n\n2017 saw a rise in wedding day outfit changes , with brides like Serena Williams and Kate Upton taking the second (and even third) wedding dress plunge. So, naturally, Paris Hilton is quick to hop on the multiple wedding gown bandwagon for her upcoming nuptials, because this celeb has never been known to do things in moderation.\n\nThe socialite turned reality TV star turned singer turned businesswoman told E! News that she has yet to pick a designer for her future gown, but she already knows that having only one just won't cut it. \"I'm getting so many different calls from designers,\" she said. \"Now I'm looking through all the designs and trying to pick which one, but there are so many gorgeous choices. It's hard to pick.\" She also added, \"I love an outfit change. It's important to have the pre-wedding dress, the wedding dress, and the after party.\" Naturally.\n\nPerhaps Paris might follow in her sister, Nicky's, footsteps, who sported a long sleeve Valentino number with a whopping $77,000 price tag (no, that's not a typo) to her 2015 wedding. Nicky also said I do to her husband, James Rothschild, at Kensington Palace which, let's be real, will be a hard venue to top. But, knowing Paris, she'll wow us regardless.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nThe 36-year-old revealed her engagement to Zylka via Instagram on January 2. The actor popped the question during a ski trip in Aspen, Colorado, treating his leading lady to an ultra-extravagant TWENTY carat pear-shaped sparkler that cost $2 million . Because, when you're dealing with Paris Hilton, it seems nothing less than the absolute best will suffice. With an engagement ring like that, we have high expectations for the couple's actual wedding, especially with A-listers like Kim Kardashian slated to make the guest list cut .\n\nSee more: Paris Hilton and Cardi B Just Realized They Have the Same Engagement Ring\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nEven though she has certain wedding planning aspects underway, Paris also confessed to E! News how difficult it's been putting plans into motion for her big day. \"My schedule is so crazy,\" she said. \"I have friends and family all over the world and I really want it to be the perfect day. Hopefully somewhere close so that everyone can make it from my family.\" She also revealed that her mom, Kathy, will help with the planning.\n\nOur only criteria for Paris Hilton's three wedding day looks? That they're \"hot.\"", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5b8bfa44dfeec92d9e3d42f4/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-983680836.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b918f99e9c103590b3339ce/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-2974538.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a4bdee78d0f6f2efa1a4829/master/pass/paris-hilton-engaged.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5bedd4f8289eca2d88822698/1:1/w_125/TN_11.JPG", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a4bdee78d0f6f2efa1a4829/1:1/w_767/paris-hilton-engaged.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a4bdee78d0f6f2efa1a4829/master/pass/paris-hilton-engaged.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/paris-hilton-wants-multiple-wedding-dresses", "title": "Can You Guess How Many Wedding Dresses Paris Hilton Will Wear on the Big Day?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Although Paris Hilton got engaged to Chris Zylka only a month ago, the hotel heiress is already planning her wedding day look(s).", "og": {"description": "Obviously, just one wedding dress wouldn't satisfy this heiress.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a4bdee78d0f6f2efa1a4829/master/pass/paris-hilton-engaged.jpg", "title": "Just Guess How Many Wedding Dresses Paris Hilton Wants", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/paris-hilton-wants-multiple-wedding-dresses", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obviously, just one wedding dress wouldn't satisfy this heiress.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a4bdee78d0f6f2efa1a4829/master/pass/paris-hilton-engaged.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Just Guess How Many Wedding Dresses Paris Hilton Wants", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/paris-hilton-wants-multiple-wedding-dresses", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "News,Celebrity Weddings", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,News,Celebrity Weddings"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
