Then she moved away from him.\n\nIn an email on Friday, Ms. Kester said the Variety account was accurate, and that she had been motivated to come forward to serve as a role model for her daughter.\n\nA third woman, who was not identified, said she met Mr. Hoffman when she was given a nonspeaking part in \u201cIshtar\u201d in a scene filmed at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. Mr. Hoffman offered to give her a ride home after a party, and they climbed into the back seat of a full station wagon, where he groped her. She described later visiting his apartment in \u201ca kind of fugue state\u201d set off by her encounter with Mr. Hoffman and abuse she suffered as a child. They had sex.\n\nAsked by Variety if she would describe the encounter in the station wagon as nonconsensual, she said \u201cyes.\u201d As for the encounter at the San Remo, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Variety reported.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter also published similar accounts on Thursday, including from Ms. Thomas, Ms. Kester and Kathryn Rossetter, an actress who said Mr. Hoffman groped her repeatedly while they were both in a Broadway production of \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d in 1983.\n\nThe reports follow an essay for The Hollywood Reporter last month by Anna Graham Hunter, who said that the actor groped her and used sexually explicit language in front of her during the making of the 1985 television film \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d when she was a 17-year-old production assistant. Ms. Thomas said the essay was what prompted her to come forward.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Hoffman responded to Ms. Hunter\u2019s account with a statement saying: \u201cI have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christine Hauser"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/dustin-hoffman-sexual-misconduct.html", "title": "Three More Women Accuse Dustin Hoffman of Sexual Misconduct, Variety Reports", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-12-15T21:33:38.000Z", "modified": "2017-12-16T00:32:53.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/christine-hauser", "tag": "#MeToo Movement"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005607229, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/41c659a1-6eb9-5178-a39a-00885e5cb7d2", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/60b32251a28e4262bed833953504f80a", "description": "The allegations included encounters in a car, a recording studio and a hotel room, where he allegedly exposed himself to a teenager.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Christine Hauser", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Dustin Hoffman,Sexual harassment,Actor,Variety,MeToo Movement", "pdate": 20171215, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/dustin-hoffman-sexual-misconduct.html", "type": "article", "title": "Three More Women Accuse Dustin Hoffman of Sexual Misconduct, Variety Reports", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "The allegations included encounters in a car, a recording studio and a hotel room, where he allegedly exposed himself to a teenager."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/dustin-hoffman-sexual-misconduct.html", "title": "Three More Women Accuse Dustin Hoffman of Sexual Misconduct, Variety Reports", "description": "The allegations included encounters in a car, a recording studio and a hotel room, where he allegedly exposed himself to a teenager.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Dustin Hoffman at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year.
