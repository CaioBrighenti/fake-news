Season 3 of NBC\u2019s hit family drama will delve even deeper into the Pearson patriarch\u2019s past, revealing how Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) overcame a troubled childhood to become Super Dad to the Big Three, what kind of relationship he had with his little-discussed little brother, Nicky, and exactly what happened to the siblings in Vietnam. Before you tune in to the season premiere on Sept. 25 at 9 p.m. ET/PT, read what the Emmy-nominated Ventimiglia has to say about Jack\u2019s journey.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: With the specter of Jack\u2019s death looming over the series, season 2 was a somewhat heavier season, though the season 2 finale \u2014 with the wedding of Kate [Chrissy Metz] and Toby [Chris Sullivan] \u2014 was a little lighter. How would you characterize season 3 thus far?\n\nMILO VENTIMIGLIA: The heavy moments so far haven\u2019t outweighed the joyous ones. There are definitely tears because we are This Is Us, but they\u2019re not quite buckets of tears like when Jack died. It feels like they are heavy moments that are leading somewhere, but also they\u2019re still hopeful and exciting and a lot of that comes through relationships coming together, i.e. Jack and Rebecca [Mandy Moore] in the beginning.\n\nWhat themes are emerging in season 3?\n\nDiscovery of the past. New burgeoning love. I\u2019ll stick with those two, respectfully, for Jack.\n\nJack has a lot of baggage from his past \u2014 including his time in Vietnam. Dan [Fogelman, the show\u2019s creator] says we\u2019re going to get a fuller picture of Jack this year. What is that picture starting to look like to you?\n\nIt\u2019s starting to look like a pretty rough upbringing. What we\u2019ve known of Stanley Pearson [Peter Onorati], he wasn\u2019t a model father, and I think we\u2019re going to start to uncover and unpack Jack\u2019s childhood \u2014 up until his teens and early twenties \u2014 and how that upbringing impacted Jack and his brother. The things that cross his path and really cemented in stone this man who loves his wife and loves his family and really puts that at the front of his existence \u2014 we\u2019re going to see the creation of that, from his younger years all the way up until the Jack that we met in the pilot.\n\nMichael Angarano has been cast as Nicky. We\u2019ve only seen Nicky as a young boy. What is young adult Nicky like? What is the dynamic of their relationship as adult brothers?\n\nThey\u2019re very close. They had that shared experience of being raised by their father, so they really had to look out for another, but they also are different spirits. Jack is very much still the older brother that looks out for his younger brother. At the same time, in what I\u2019ve read so far of those scenes, Jack leaves room for his younger brother to be his own man and to stand up for himself. But Jack kind of can\u2019t help but always want to do better for his brother.\n\nKevin is off to Vietnam, presumably to learn more about Jack\u2019s past. How would you characterize the revelations and surprises that are in store for viewers? When Dan first told you about it, you said that \u201cHoly s\u2014\u201d was your reaction.\n\nIt\u2019s still the same. It\u2019s still a \u201cHoly s\u2014!\u201d reaction to what\u2019s going on with Jack and Nicky, particularly relating to Vietnam and how Jack lost his brother. It\u2019s going to take a moment to set the character up, and really understand the challenges that he\u2019s been through as an individual. We can only assume that he\u2019s seen the same that Jack has seen, but they are individuals so it\u2019s going to take us a moment to set that up. The first time we see him on camera is going to paint a pretty clear picture of what his demons are, and what his struggles in life are. But just like classic This Is Us, we\u2019re going to bounce around in time and see a greater look at a new Pearson.\n\nWhere do this season\u2019s emotional gut punches rank for you?\n\nDefinitely up there. Knowing that Jack, 36 and older, he\u2019s a bit more stoic, so I have to imagine that as a younger man, you experience these things and you don\u2019t quite have with your guard with regards to your emotion. There is a lot of emotion in store for Jack Pearson, especially around wartime, especially around his brother, and the circumstances that follow him home from war\u2026 War is war, there are people in the thick of it or the thin of it, but regardless if you\u2019re wearing a uniform, you\u2019re going to see the worst of it, and Jack definitely is in the thick of it, but at the same time it\u2019s always been interesting to me to know why specifically Jack so casually says that he\u2019s a mechanic. The thing that he\u2019s really protecting his family from knowing \u2014 that\u2019s the stuff that\u2019s interesting to me.\n\nDan said that the show is going to focus an episode on Vietnam. What can you hint about that?\n\nFrom the very last episode of the second season, you see Kevin and Zoe [Melanie Liburd], and Kevin holding the photograph of his father. It\u2019s a journey of discovery for both Pearson men.\n\nWhat were your first thoughts when Dan told you he wanted the show to spend a significant chunk of time on this Vietnam story with Jack and make it a significant part of season 3?\n\nI was pretty grateful because there\u2019s a lot to learn about Jack in his younger years that influence this father that we all love. We need to see that. We need to see Jack before Rebecca. We need to see a Jack that is in some happy times as well as some hard times. We also need to see the discovery of love [between] Jack and Rebecca. So playing the younger years of Jack, I\u2019m just very much looking forward to.\n\nWhat was the piece of research that you did that was most illuminating?\n\nThe most impactful \u2014 I did read Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s book [The Things They Carried, and O\u2019Brien is a consultant for this season], and those stories are so amazing and disturbing because they\u2019re real. Also, I had my father \u2014 my father being a two-time Vietnam vet \u2014 I heard his experiences and he told me his stories, so I always had that growing up.\n\nWhat was his reaction when you told him that the show was going to explore this story line?\n\nI think he\u2019s as interested as anybody else. And he has his view on his time spent just like any veteran would have their view on the time spent, as would any American who lived through that time in the \u201960s and early \u201970s. He\u2019s curious to see how it\u2019s all going to unfold for Jack. There have been movies about Vietnam, but I think the reminder [is] that war is something that is absolute destruction, for a good reason or an unknown reason. War is not a good thing. It\u2019s a very hard, destructive process, and no one really \u201cwins\u201d in the end.\n\nThe season premiere shows the first date of Jack and Rebecca. What surprised you about this story?\n\nWhat surprised me was the magic was there, but it took a while for the prestige to come to light.\n\nThere were some new mysteries dropped into the season 2 finale, not necessarily involving you. Was there a relief in that? Like, \u2018Okay, you guys take on some of the mystery\u2019?\n\n[Laughs] To be honest, I\u2019m thankful that the show\u2019s mystery is a little more about other people, the dying question being, \u2018Who is Randall [Sterling K. Brown] saying that Tess [Iantha Richardson] needs to go see?\u2019 Thank god I don\u2019t have to Fort Knox that secret this year too much. I\u2019ll leave it to everyone else.\n\nI\u2019ll ask you one question. How big is this thing?\n\nIt\u2019s pretty huge. It\u2019s pretty great.\n\nFor season 3 intel from creator Dan Fogelman, head over here.\n\nFor even more hints from Mandy Moore, click here.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/602b73f362605bc89706a277f90e2fb1?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/nup_179168_47451.jpg?crop=150px%2C55px%2C909px%2C908px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/netflix-tvs.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/angel2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/hulu.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/terror_202_ea_0124_0196_rt.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/euphoria-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/nup_183539_3802.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/nup_183539_3802.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/this-is-us3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/nup_183539_3802.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Snierson"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/24/this-is-us-milo-ventimiglia-season-3-preview/", "title": "This Is Us: Milo Ventimiglia teases season 3 surprises and brother Nicky's demons", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Fall TV,Milo Ventimiglia", "news_keywords": "Fall TV,Milo Ventimiglia", "description": "The star of NBC's family drama is relieved that he doesn't have to 'Fort Knox' the season's biggest mystery.", "og": {"title": "'This Is Us' star Milo Ventimiglia hints that Jack's brother Nicky has 'demons'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/24/this-is-us-milo-ventimiglia-season-3-preview/", "description": "Jack Pearson's heart may have given out last season, but the beat went on for\u00a0This Is Us viewers \u2014 and\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/nup_183539_3802.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/24/this-is-us-milo-ventimiglia-season-3-preview/", "description": "The star of NBC's family drama is relieved that he doesn't have to 'Fort Knox' the season's biggest mystery.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/nup_183539_3802.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/24/this-is-us-milo-ventimiglia-season-3-preview/", "title": "'This Is Us' star Milo Ventimiglia hints that Jack's brother Nicky has 'demons'", "description": "The star of NBC's family drama is relieved that he doesn't have to 'Fort Knox' the season's biggest mystery.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/nup_183539_3802.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537761600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
