Following the success of Lambert\u2019s latest album, The Weight of These Wings, the country star revealed that she struggled just making it through her daily life while living on Shelton\u2019s sprawling ranch.\n\nLambert admitted that things got so rough with Shelton that it started to affect her music. She recalled a time when she was contracted to write a car commercial song and she barely got it done in time. It was at that moment that she realized something needed to change.\n\n\u201cI remember I had to write a song for a Dodge RAM commercial. It was hard. I barely got it out, and I was like, \u2018Man, I need some fuel. I have to go fall in love with it again,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cSo Nashville does that for me.\u201d\n\nLambert and Shelton have been separated for close to two years. Although Lambert has been more open about the split this year, she doesn\u2019t like talking about the breakup. Instead, the country star lets her music do the talking.\n\n\u201cIf you want to hear my side of the story or my opinion of what happened, it\u2019s all on there,\u201d she shared. \u201cThere\u2019s no mystery anymore\u2014take from it what you will.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of her music, People reports that Lambert did not want to write a typical breakup album. Instead, Lambert wanted to sing about everything that was going on in her life at the moment, including the good and bad.\n\n\u201cI walked in with guns blazing,\u201d Lambert explained. \u201cI just knew one thing: I didn\u2019t want a breakup record. I was like, \u2018Let\u2019s feel it all.\u2019 I was ready to have the days where I can\u2019t even stand up and the days where I\u2019m celebrating.\u201d\n\nYou ain\u2019t missing nothing, love is so damn hard, take it from me darlin\u2019, you don\u2019t want a heart. -Miranda Lambert pic.twitter.com/38A9WOBKpW \u2014 Country Music Quotes (@Country_Voices) July 27, 2017\n\nLambert added that she doesn\u2019t always feel as confident and fiery as she lets on. While she has her ups and down like anyone else, Lambert explained how the split changed her perspective on life. Lambert no longer takes emotional hardship for granted and understands herself at a deeper level.\n\nWhile Lambert is still enjoying the success of her latest album, she has found love with boyfriend Anderson East. The couple is currently enjoying their romance in Nashville and Lambert occasionally takes a break on her massive farm close to the city limits.\n\nShe may have been bored on Shelton\u2019s ranch, but Lambert enjoys her time alone on the farm, where she can wear whatever she wants and spend all day playing with her dogs.\n\nAlthough Lambert isn\u2019t afraid to sing about most subjects, she doesn\u2019t like to write about politics. In fact, Lambert believes bringing politics into music just creates a divide amongst fans who just want to have a good time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, as many of you already know, Miranda Lambert\u2019s ex-husband has also moved on since the divorce. Shelton is currently dating No Doubt alum Gwen Stefani.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RHOA-Porsha-Williams-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1a5f14b8152552942e79d873deb34999?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Miranda-Lambert-Reportedly-Needed-Fuel-To-Get-Through-Her-Daily-Life-In-Oklahoma-With-Blake-Shelton.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Scheana-marie-robert-parks-valletta-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/DuB5fgVV4AAVoBP-300x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Miranda-Lambert-Caught-Drowning-Her-Sorrows-All-Alone-Wheres-Brendan-McLoughlin_-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jenelle-evans-1-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Voice-Head-Honcho-Carson-Daly-Tells-Blake-Shelton-Not-To-Let-Gwen-Stefani-Go-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/camille-grammer-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Miranda-Lambert-Reportedly-Needed-Fuel-To-Get-Through-Her-Daily-Life-In-Oklahoma-With-Blake-Shelton.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Lynn Gintonio", "Ann Mose", "Gloria Meredith", "Annie Smith"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/miranda-lambert-reportedly-needed-fuel-to-get-through-her-daily-life-in-oklahoma-with-blake-shelton-56331/", "title": "Miranda Lambert Reportedly Needed \u2018Fuel\u2019 To Get Through Her Daily Life In Oklahoma With Blake Shelton", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "blake shelton, gwen stefani, miranda lambert,", "keywords": "celebrity news, blake shelton, gwen stefani, miranda lambert,", "description": "Miranda Lambert\u2019s life in Oklahoma with Blake Shelton was harder than anyone thought.
