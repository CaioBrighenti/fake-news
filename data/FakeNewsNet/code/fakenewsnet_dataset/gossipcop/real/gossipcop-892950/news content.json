Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nJason Momoa and Lisa Bonet secretly got married this October.\n\nAlthough they normally keep things pretty low-key, Momoa opened up about their love to James Cordon.\n\nHe said he's had a crush on her since he was 8 years old, and that he freaked out when they first met.\n\nActors Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet have been one of Hollywood's cutest and most interesting couples for more than a decade now. And although they usually keep things pretty private, following the news of their recent secret wedding, Momoa has been sharing some sweet tidbits about their relationship.\n\nMomoa, 38, appeared on \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" and when Corden congratulated him on his recent nuptials, he happily flashed his new wedding ring. Though he and Bonet, 49, have been together for about 12 years, Momoa told Corden that their love story actually began 30 years ago, when he saw her on TV.\n\n\"Listen it was more than [love at first sight]. Ever since I was 8 years old and I saw her on the TV I was like, 'Mommy, I want that one,'\" Momoa gushed. \"I was like, 'I'm going to stalk you for the rest of my life, and I'm going to get you.' I'm a full-fledged stalker.\"\n\n\"But yeah, I've just always wanted to meet her. She was a queen, always,\" he continued.\n\nDespite Momoa's apparent convictions to making Bonet his wife one day, the story of how they actually met is a lot cuter. Momoa said that they met through mutual friends at a jazz club and he, understandably, freaked out about meeting his childhood crush.\n\n\"I literally turned around and I see her and she goes, ya know, 'I'm Lisa,'\" he recalled. \"I turned around to my friend and I was like 'ahhh!' I had f------ fireworks going off inside man.\"\n\nThese two love a good brew.

You ordered a Guinness tonight,\" Corden said.\n\n\"I beyond love Guinness,\" Momoa said, gesturing to his mug. \"She ordered a Guinness and I ordered grits. We had Guinness and grits, and the rest is history.\"\n\nThe two have two children together, Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha Momoa and Lola Iolani Momoa, and he serves as step-dad to Bonet's daughter, actress Zo\u00eb Kravitz.\n\nBased on their long partnership and how lovingly Momoa talks about Bonet, I think it's safe to say that they will be sharing many more pints of Guinness and many more bowls of grits together as a married couple.\n\nYou can watch the whole segment below:", "images": ["https://amp.insider.com/images/5a09b43f9153328e008b46e0-1920-960.jpg", "https://amp.insider.com/images/5a09b433cb66d023008b46f4-750-562.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.insider.com/images/5a09b43f9153328e008b46e0-1920-960.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kristin Salaky"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/how-did-jason-momoa-lisa-bonet-meet-get-married-2017-11", "title": "This former 'Game of Thrones' star says he's been in love with his wife since he was 8 years old \u2014 and the story of how they finally met is adorable", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.insider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#111111", "date": "2017-11-13", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-13", "news_keywords": "Jason Momoa, Relationships, Dating, Love, Celebrity Couples, Kristin Salaky", "sailthru.tags": "Jason Momoa, Relationships, Dating, Love, Celebrity Couples, Kristin Salaky", "description": "Jason Momoa shared how he and now-wife Lisa Bonet fell in love over grits and Guinness.", "sailthru.description": "Jason Momoa shared how he and now-wife Lisa Bonet fell in love over grits and Guinness.", "title": "This former 'Game of Thrones' star says he's been in love with his wife since he was 8 years old \u2014 and the story of how they finally met is adorable", "sailthru.verticals": "health, culture", "sailthru.title": "This former 'Game of Thrones' star says he's been in love with his wife since he was 8 years old \u2014 and the story of how they finally met is adorable", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/5a09b43f9153328e008b46e0-1920-960.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.insider.com/images/5a09b433cb66d023008b46f4-1920-1440.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.insider.com/images/5a09b433cb66d023008b46f4-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Health", "sailthru.author": "Kristin Salaky", "og": {"title": "This former 'Game of Thrones' star says he's been in love with his wife since he was 8 years old \u2014 and the story of how they finally met is adorable", "description": "Jason Momoa shared how he and now-wife Lisa Bonet fell in love over grits and Guinness.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thisisinsider.com/how-did-jason-momoa-lisa-bonet-meet-get-married-2017-11", "image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/5a09b43f9153328e008b46e0-1920-960.jpg", "site_name": "INSIDER"}, "author": "Kristin Salaky", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.insider.com/how-did-jason-momoa-lisa-bonet-meet-get-married-2017-11", "title": "This former 'Game of Thrones' star says he's been in love with his wife since he was 8 years old \u2014 and the story of how they finally met is adorable", "description": "Jason Momoa shared how he and now-wife Lisa Bonet fell in love over grits and Guinness.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/5a09b43f9153328e008b46e0-1920-960.jpg", "creator": "@kristinsalaky", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "INSIDER": "Snapchat", "This former 'Game of Thrones' star says he's been in love with his wife since he was 8 years old \u2014 and the story of how they finally met is adorable": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510549200.0, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
