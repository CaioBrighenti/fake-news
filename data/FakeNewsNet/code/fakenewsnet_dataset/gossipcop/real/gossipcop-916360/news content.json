Not only getting to work with you... but, getting to know you. You, my friend, are an incredible young man. Well before joining this cast I was a fan... a fan that loved watching you grow up in front of a camera. From the moment you first put on the way too large sheriffs hat as a boy... to the end, the hat so befitting of the man Carl had become. Wiser and more compassionate than all of us. You held all of our hearts. Honestly... a huge reason I wanted so badly to join this band of misfits... was because I was such a fan of the Negan Carl relationship in the comics... that storyline was one of my favorites, as I know it was one of yours. I\u2019ll forever be dissaponted we only scratched the surface of what could have been. BUT... I can take total solace in the fact that you are out there... doing your thing. You\u2019ve grown into an amazing young man as well as a powerful actor... the world is your oyster Riggs. We all get to sit back and watch you kill it. So.. know you are missed on the show... but know you have a big ole group of family all here for you if needed... and eagerly awaiting whatever comes next. Love you Riggs. See you soon.\n\nA post shared by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (@jeffreydeanmorgan) on Feb 25, 2018 at 9:09pm PST", "images": ["https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557171.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1232984.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/assets/images/longroom_logo1.png", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557089.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1244778.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557175.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557105.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557024.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1556971.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557188.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1122836.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557062.jpg", "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018126/rs_600x600-180226061528-600.the-walking-dead-carl.ch.022618.jpg?fit=around%7C450:350&crop=450:350;center,top&output-quality=100", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1232953.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557148.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557178.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557004.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1232964.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557126.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1117582.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1556966.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557190.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557210.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557147.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557187.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557193.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/an_pw/piwik.php?action_name=nsrc_img&idsite=1&rec=1&bots=1"], "top_img": "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018126/rs_600x600-180226061528-600.the-walking-dead-carl.ch.022618.jpg?fit=around%7C450:350&crop=450:350;center,top&output-quality=100", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.longroom.com/discussion/907781/carls-the-walking-dead-death-the-cast-and-crew-mourn-and-tease-vengeance", "title": "Carl's The Walking Dead Death: The Cast and Crew Mourn and Tease \"Vengeance\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Long Room", "title": "Carl's The Walking Dead Death: The Cast and Crew Mourn and Tease \"Vengeance\"", "url": "https://www.longroom.com/discussion/907781/carls-the-walking-dead-death-the-cast-and-crew-mourn-and-tease-vengeance", "description": "lastly-\n\nnone of us could have done this without you. it was always for the fans, and it always will be.", "image": "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018126/rs_600x600-180226061528-600.the-walking-dead-carl.ch.022618.jpg?fit=around%7C450:350&amp;crop=450:350;center,top&amp;output-quality=100"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.longroom.com", "summary": ""}
