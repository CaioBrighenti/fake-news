But that\u2019s chump change compared to the website\u2019s value and how much it\u2019s earned Paltrow.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to say precisely what Gwyneth Paltrow has earned from Goop, the private startup has been on a roll as of late. This year, it received an infusion of $50 million in investment cash, bringing its total valuation to $250 million. And the actress\u2014who\u2019s spending a lot less time on the big screen\u2014stands to gain a lot as founder and CEO. Her personal net worth was estimated at $140 million in 2014.\n\nIf Goop and Paltrow\u2019s second career are still a bit unfamiliar to you, here\u2019s a brief rundown of how she built her wellness empire.\n\n2008: Goop starts as a modest newsletter\n\nThe beginnings of Goop seem almost laughably humble in retrospect. Paltrow, an Oscar winner who rode the success of Shakespeare in Love to lucrative projects including the role of Pepper Potts in the Iron Man movie franchise, started Goop with the aims of recommending things\u2014from a detox plan to her own recipes for turkey rag\u00f9 and banana-nut muffins. She personally sent out the Goop newsletter from her kitchen, finding a select audience of people who wanted to live, or at least eat and train, like her. She had about 150,000 subscribers in 2009. She remembers sitting at home in London around this time and being thrilled when $45 came in as a result of an advertising partnership.\n\nGoop sort of gets it name from Paltrow herself, who goes by \u201cG.P.\u201d and especially in those early days, the brand and its face were virtually synonymous. \u201cMy life is good because I am not passive about it,\u201d she wrote in a website posting. \u201cI want to nourish what is real, and I want to do it without wasting time.\u201d Then, as now, the Goop content is free, even if the promoted products can be exorbitantly costly, like $956 toilet paper.\n\nPredictably, Goop also faced backlash that hasn\u2019t died, though back then it was more about Paltrow\u2019s ostentatious display of wealth and privilege.\n\n2014: Goop makes a hard push into e-commerce\n\nThe next logical step for Goop was to actually sell the things it recommended. As part of this mission, the company brought in Lisa Gersh, former CEO and president of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, to be its chief executive. Goop expanded its e-commerce offerings, shipping its own wares. The site now sells everything from fashion to vitamins and household goods, including some products it manufactures itself, geared toward customers aspiring to the ideal Goop life. But many items\u2014including, say, a $725 pajama set\u2014certainly aren\u2019t suitable for everyone\u2019s wallets.\n\n\u201cOur stuff is beautiful,\u201d Paltrow said, according to The New York Times. \u201cThe ingredients are beautiful. You can\u2019t get that at a lower price point. You can\u2019t make these things mass-market.\u201d\n\n2017: Goop Wellness launches\n\nGoop-branded products quadrupled in sales revenue in 2017, when the company brought in an estimated $45 to $60 million, a jump from $15 to $20 million the year before.\n\nIn an effort to ramp up its own product offerings, in the same year it started Goop Wellness, a set of vitamins that, in the vague wording of a press release, are \u201csupplement regimens that address the acute needs of modern women.\u201d The Times reports that Goop says it sold $100,000 of the vitamins in their first day on the market.\n\nThe criticisms against Goop became more worrying. In 2017, the watchdog group Truth in Advertising Inc. filed a complaint with California health regulators charging that the site was making dubious health claims about its products, which became the basis of the lawsuit that Goop just settled. The vaginal jade eggs it sold were said to \u201cincrease vaginal muscle tone, hormonal balance, and feminine energy in general.\u201d (Those claims have been removed from Goop\u2019s site.)\n\n2018: Tripled revenue and global expansion\n\nAt least so far, the scandals don\u2019t seem to have slowed down Goop\u2019s gravy train. Its latest round of funding has brought its total investment to $82 million, and Goop told Fortune that it has tripled its revenue for the past two years and is on track to more than double revenue in 2018.\n\nGoop even hosts wellness summits now, with tickets ranging from $500 to $4,500. In exchange, fans of the brand experience products, panels, doctors, and \u201chealers.\u201d And it has a print magazine, putting Paltrow alongside the likes of Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey in the media realm. The company also has plans for an international rollout.\n\nAs for the $250 million valuation, if Goop sells or goes public\u2014assuming the controversy doesn\u2019t make it go bust\u2014Paltrow stands to gain quite a good chunk of that coin. And that $140 million net worth might keep rising.", "images": ["http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1012_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/money-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1012_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/180910-gwyneth-paltrow-goop.jpg?quality=85"], "top_img": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/180910-gwyneth-paltrow-goop.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Schrodt"], "canonical_link": "http://money.com/money/5390761/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-net-worth/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Is Valued at $250 Million.
