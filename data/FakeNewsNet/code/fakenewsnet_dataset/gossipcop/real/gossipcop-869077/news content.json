They also cooked their own food -- like corn and hot dogs -- over a camp fire.\n\nWATCH: Gosselin Family Celebrates Sextuplets' 13th Birthday With Glamping and Camping Parties!\n\nMeanwhile, the girls decided to have fun \"glamping.\" They made flower crowns with arts and crafts kits and got mani-pedis from an on-site manicurist. Their fancy dinner was filet mignon served on a table, just like how elegant people camp.\n\nFinally, after all the fun and games, it was time for their cakes. That's right, two awesome cakes to commemorate the milestone birthday. For the boys, there was a cake decorated with fire, while the girls enjoyed a regal, two-tiered pink cake, complete with a pink tent on top and the number 13.\n\nI can\u2019t believe they're 13!

We always have the big birthday party at home on their birthday, [I] got 'em for every year,\" Kate shared. \"This year [was] much like last year, obviously the difference is that Collin wasn't there.\"\n\n\"I am comforted with the fact that my kids, all of them, each unique child, is receiving exactly what they need and that hasn't changed,\" she continued. \"I've said that before, I'll say it again. It's a bittersweet moment [and] we've had many of them. You can't do anything without realizing he's missing, so we may not say it, but it's always there.\"\n\nFor more from Kate on her difficult decision to enroll her son in a special needs program, watch the video below.", "images": ["https://www.wusa9.com/img/resize/content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/07/25/et_072417_Kate_HU_10121569_ver1.0.png?mode=pad&bgcolor=000000&scale=both&width=750&height=422", "https://www.wusa9.com/img/resize/content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/07/25/et_072417_Kate_HU_10121569_ver1.0.png?mode=pad&bgcolor=000000&scale=both&width=1140&height=641", "https://cdn.tegna-media.com/wbir/assets/attheborder-352x52.png", "https://www.wusa9.com/content/logos/mobile/wusa.png"], "top_img": "https://www.wusa9.com/img/resize/content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/07/25/et_072417_Kate_HU_10121569_ver1.0.png?mode=pad&bgcolor=000000&scale=both&width=1140&height=641", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Author", "Zach Seemayer", "Published", "Am Edt July", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wusa9.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/kate-gosselin-gets-emotional-while-celebrating-the-sextuplets-birthday-without-collin-on-kate-plus/65-459298593", "title": "Kate Gosselin Gets Emotional While Celebrating the Sextuplets' Birthday Without Collin on 'Kate Plus", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1170", "site": "wusa9.com", "fb": {"app_id": 143217143049026}, "og": {"site_name": "WUSA", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.wusa9.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/kate-gosselin-gets-emotional-while-celebrating-the-sextuplets-birthday-without-collin-on-kate-plus/65-459298593", "title": "Kate Gosselin Gets Emotional While Celebrating the Sextuplets' Birthday Without Collin on 'Kate Plus", "description": "Kate Gosselin celebrated her sextuplets 13th birthday on Monday's all new episode of Kate Plus 8, but one of the reality star's children was noticeably missing from the festivities --", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wusa9.com/img/resize/content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/07/25/et_072417_Kate_HU_10121569_ver1.0.png?mode=pad&bgcolor=000000&scale=both&width=1140&height=641", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "7/25/2017 5:44:00 AM"}}, "description": "Kate Gosselin celebrated her sextuplets 13th birthday on Monday's all new episode of Kate Plus 8, but one of the reality star's children was noticeably missing from the festivities --", "category": "entertainment", "twitter": {"title": "Kate Gosselin Gets Emotional While Celebrating the Sextuplets' Birthday Without Collin on 'Kate Plus", "image": {"src": "https://www.wusa9.com/img/resize/content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/07/25/et_072417_Kate_HU_10121569_ver1.0.png?mode=pad&bgcolor=000000&scale=both&width=360&height=203"}, "card": "summary", "site": "WUSA9", "description": "Kate Gosselin celebrated her sextuplets 13th birthday on Monday's all new episode of Kate Plus 8, but one of the reality star's children was noticeably missing from the festivities --", "domain": "www.wusa9.com"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500975840.0, "source": "https://www.wusa9.com", "summary": ""}
