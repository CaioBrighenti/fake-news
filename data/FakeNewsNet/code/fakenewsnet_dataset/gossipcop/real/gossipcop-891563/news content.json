Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nLast week, Kim Kardashian West was accused of cultural appropriation over her Aaliyah Haughton Halloween costume, which was meant to resemble the late singer's outfit from her \"Try Again\" music video.\n\nOn November 3, the reality TV star apologized for the costume on her website \u2014 but now people are taking issue with her response.\n\n\"I saw online that some people thought my costume was in poor taste and I am truly sorry if that offended anyone, but I wasn't dressing up as a race or culture but rather as a woman whom I admire,\" she wrote.\n\nKim went on to say that she didn't intend to offend anyone with her costume. \"We don't see color in my home. It's all love and respect,\" she wrote.\n\nNow, people are taking issue with her apology.\n\nThis was one of Kim's four elaborate, musician-inspired Halloween costumes.\n\nAlthough she dressed as Cher and Madonna without incident, the reality TV star faced additional accusations of cultural appropriation over her Selena Quintanilla costume.\n\nHowever, Kim did not address those claims in her apology.\n\nInstead, she concluded her statement by repeating what she said on Twitter earlier that week: \"We are just paying homage to people and artists we love and respect \u2014 it's that simple!\"\n\nYou can read Kim's full apology here:\n\n\"Aaliyah was such an amazing singer and she will forever be a music legend. I saw online that some people were offended by my Aaliyah costume and I am sorry if that offended anyone, but I wasn't dressing up as a race or culture, but rather as a woman I admire and think is amazing, so I don't agree honestly. I play all kinds of music in my home and I like for my kids to be exposed to many different artists as options for our Halloween costumes. We don't see color in my home. It's all love and respect. Kourtney was Michael Jackson for one of her costumes and she wasn't criticized. My son was Axel Rose. We are just paying homage to people and artists we love and respect \u2014 it's that simple!\"\n\nA representative for Kim Kardashian West declined to comment following INSIDER's request.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a0084dd42fd751409205db7-1136-568.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a0084dd42fd751409205db8-750-562.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a0084dd42fd751409205db7-1136-568.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susanna Heller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/kim-kardashian-aaliyah-halloween-costume-apology-2017-11", "title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-11-06", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-06", "news_keywords": "Design, Celebrity, Kardashians, Kim Kardashian, Aaliyah, Halloween 2017, Halloween Costume, Susanna Heller", "sailthru.tags": "Design, Celebrity, Kardashians, Kim Kardashian, Aaliyah, Halloween 2017, Halloween Costume, Susanna Heller", "description": "The reality TV star apologized for her Aaliyah Haughton Halloween costume, but some people think her apology did more harm than good.", "sailthru.description": "The reality TV star apologized for her Aaliyah Haughton Halloween costume, but some people think her apology did more harm than good.", "title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a0084dd42fd751409205db7-1136-568.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59ca783aba785e6cbe07134d-960-719.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59ca783aba785e6cbe07134d-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "sailthru.author": "Susanna Heller", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "description": "The reality TV star apologized for her Aaliyah Haughton Halloween costume, but some people think her apology did more harm than good.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-aaliyah-halloween-costume-apology-2017-11", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a0084dd42fd751409205db7-1136-568.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Susanna Heller, INSIDER", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-aaliyah-halloween-costume-apology-2017-11", "title": "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume: 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'", "description": "The reality TV star apologized for her Aaliyah Haughton Halloween costume, but some people think her apology did more harm than good.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a0084dd42fd751409205db7-1136-568.jpg", "creator": "@susiehheller", "site": "@"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "Kim Kardashian apologizes for her controversial Aaliyah Halloween costume": {" 'We don\u2019t see color in my home'": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509944400.0, "source": "http://uk.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
