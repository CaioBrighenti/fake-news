We loved her on Alias, and she stole our hearts in 13 Going On 30. And now, she's giving new meaning to the term #momgoals with her turn on social media. Jennifer Garner is a mom to three kids -- Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6 -- whom she shares with her ex, Ben Affleck. Ben and Jen announced their split in 2015, but didn't actually make it official until 2017. During that time, many outlets blamed Ben's infidelities as the cause of their split. (Jen subsequently won the public over with her grace and composure in the face of such a tough time.) She remains steadfast in her kids-first approach to co-parenting with Ben and is the epitome of what it means to be a loving and caring person and the ultimate mom friend.\n\n\n\nJennifer joined Instagram a little less than a year ago, and we are so glad she did as we get to peel a few layers back and see more of her goofy and lovable personality. She makes being a single mom look easy and fun -- which is no easy task. Jennifer's posts have moms everywhere collectively laughing or nodding their heads in agreement. From struggling to wrap presents, to donning her old marching band uniform, or helping her kids sell Girl Scout Cookies, she is a celebrity mom we just love to root for and relate to and really is as good as gold. Whether she's hanging out with Ina Garten or reading stories to her dog, Jennifer Garner is truly the mom friend we all wish we had. She's definitely worth following for some laughs and inspiration.\n\n\n\nHere are many times Jennifer Garner proved to be beyond relatable and the ultimate mom friend we don't deserve.\n\n", "images": ["https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/22/08/x4/h3/phrynyaqok2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/23/16/qs/qz/phu43xilwc2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/23/16/2w/22/phqth2ypus2qbwe.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2219521341664693&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/22/08/5g/w4/phq666zxwc2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/23/16/6n/2o/phum0ssmo82qbwe.png", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2620772835795&event=pagevisit&noscript=1", "https://ugc-01.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/630/600/70/2018/08/24/15/61/j9/ph8u7hqfgo2qbwe.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/24/10/3b/03/ph4ps5kx2c2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/383/215/70//2015/10/20/11/do/yt/phbepbrf481.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/383/215/70//2019/04/26/22/e2/cb/pokbz62bcww.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/383/215/70//2018/05/16/16/aa/1x/po5lgozegwb1.png", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2620772835795&noscript=1", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/23/16/85/2n/phns7pieos2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/24/17/77/aj/phzl0m2zok2qbwe.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035453&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_wn=", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/383/215/70//2015/09/10/14/7v/8f/phhy7kg0kc1.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/24/09/4r/8y/phjzo256kg2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/383/215/70//2015/12/07/13/c1/3l/phdiclqm0w1.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bnzfTM78T_ems.gif", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/22/08/76/8n/phxrrf21kw2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/22/08/f3/gu/phf2h5600k2qbwe.png", "https://bcp.crwdcntrl.net/5/c=9173/b=54110582", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/23/16/6q/00/phmqqumm4g2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/383/215/70//2015/08/07/10/9g/z2/phhz78cxcs1.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/23/16/56/yv/phw0ctq70g2qbwe.png", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/crop/500/500/70/2019/07/12/09/5m/ki/phy76jz00s.jpg", "https://ugc-02.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/740/1500/75/2018/08/24/16/dc/78/ph73jalsoc2qbwe.jpg", "http://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=00ac890c0d35e84369869b88ad0fd5b301"], "top_img": "https://ugc-01.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/630/600/70/2018/08/24/15/61/j9/ph8u7hqfgo2qbwe.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thestir.cafemom.com/celebrity_moms/214044/jennifer-garner-relatable-mom-friend", "title": "17 Times Jennifer Garner Proved to Be the Relatable Mom Friend We Can't Help but Love", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Jennifer Garner is truly a class act and a gem of a mother.", "news_keywords": "jennifer garner, jennifer garner instagram, jennifer garner 2018, jennifer garner and ben affleck 2018, once upon a farm jennifer garner, jennifer garner ben affleck, ben and jennifer garner, jennifer garner and ben affleck", "og": {"site_name": "CafeMom", "title": "17 Times Jennifer Garner Proved to Be the Relatable Mom Friend We Can't Help but Love", "type": "article", "url": "https://thestir.cafemom.com/celebrity_moms/214044/jennifer-garner-relatable-mom-friend", "image": "https://ugc-01.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/630/600/70/2018/08/24/15/61/j9/ph8u7hqfgo2qbwe.jpg", "description": "Jennifer Garner is truly a class act and a gem of a mother."}, "twitter": {"site": "@cafemom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "17 Times Jennifer Garner Proved to Be the Relatable Mom Friend We Can't Help but Love", "description": "Jennifer Garner is truly a class act and a gem of a mother.", "image": "https://ugc-01.cafemomstatic.com/gen/constrain/630/600/70/2018/08/24/15/61/j9/ph8u7hqfgo2qbwe.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 100561773354557}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://thestir.cafemom.com", "summary": ""}
