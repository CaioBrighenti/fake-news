In a clip posted to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Instagram, the duo did a little jump for the camera to show their excitement for the movie.\n\nBlue wore a beige dress with a tie detail around her neck, covering up with a black jacket with multiple patches. Beyonc\u00e9, 36, also posted several snaps of her ensemble, a white dress with a blue flower pattern and ruffled skirt. The dress had a plunging neckline and showed plenty of leg. Beyonc\u00e9 finished off her outfit with neutral heels and a pair of small frame sunglasses, which are quickly becoming part of her signature look.
