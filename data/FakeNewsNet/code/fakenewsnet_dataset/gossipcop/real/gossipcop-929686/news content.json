Not long after, Mill had a homecoming-like reception at the Wells Fargo Center ahead of the hometown team\u2019s Game 5 against the Miami Heat. (Mill also served as the pregame bell ringer.)\n\nMill, 30, was sentenced in November 2017 for a minimum of two years for violating probation in a 2008 gun and drug case by getting arrested twice.\n\nMeek Mill is in the building for Game 5. pic.twitter.com/m8oH7j1BwX \u2014 NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) April 24, 2018\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank God, my family, my friends, my attorneys, my team at Roc Nation including JAY-Z, Desiree Perez, my good friend Michael Rubin, my fans, The Pennsylvania Supreme Court and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time,\u201d Mill said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE, which was also tweeted by the hitmaker.\n\n\u201cWhile the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive. To the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s office, I\u2019m grateful for your commitment to justice \u2013 not only for my case but for others that have been wrongfully jailed due to police misconduct,\u201d he continued.\n\nImage zoom Meek Mill Bobby Metelus/Getty Images for New Era Cap\n\n\u201cAlthough I\u2019m blessed to have the resources to fight this unjust situation, I understand that many people of color across the country don\u2019t have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues. In the meantime, I plan to work closely with my legal team to overturn this unwarranted conviction and look forward to reuniting with my family and resuming my music career,\u201d Mill concluded his statement.\n\n\u201cAs our office has made clear in recent court filings, the Pa. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on Meek Mill being released on bail is consistent with the position of the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office,\u201d a spokesperson for the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office told PEOPLE in a statement.\n\nRELATED: Superior Court Rejects Meek Mill Bail Request but Orders Philadelphia Judge to Act \u2018Without Delay\u2019\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Meek Mill Sentenced to 2 to 4 Years in State Prison for Violating Probation\n\nNews of Mill\u2019s release was first announced by Philadelphia 76ers co-owner Michael Rubin and reported by TMZ.

As we have said all along, Meek was unjustly convicted and should not have spent a single day in jail.\u201d\n\nAdding, \u201cWe are also pleased that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has noted that Judge Brinkley may opt to remove herself from presiding over any further proceedings in Meek\u2019s case in the interests of justice. Meek is excited to be reunited with his family, and we, along with Meek, intend to continue to shine the light on a justice system in need of reform to prevent any other citizen from being put through what Meek has endured.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Meek Mill and JAY-Z Johnny Nunez/WireImage\n\nRELATED: JAY-Z Writes Op-Ed About Meek Mill and the \u2018Absurd\u2019 Flaws in the Criminal Justice System\n\nMill was previously in jail for eight months and on probation for five years due to a 2008 conviction for gun and drug charges. In 2016, Mill was placed under 90 days of house arrest for violating probation due to unapproved travel.\n\nIn March 2017, he was charged with misdemeanor assault after an altercation with employees at St. Louis International Airport. The charges were dropped after he agreed to perform community service.\n\nThen in August 2017, PEOPLE confirmed that Mill was charged with reckless endangerment in New York City. He later pleaded guilty to reckless driving.\n\nImage zoom Meek Mill Pennsylvania Department of Corrections\n\nAfter news of the November 2017 sentencing, many celebrities, including JAY-Z, voiced their support for Mill while criticizing the legal system.\n\nIn addition, a petition was created on Change.org, titled \u201cSomebody Save Meek Mill,\u201d that called for Tom Wolf, Governor of Pennsylvania, to reevaluate the rapper\u2019s sentencing.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ed-sheeran.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630",
