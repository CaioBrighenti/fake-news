It has the slightly pejorative connotation of something ordinary\u2014the antithesis of the magic and wonder that fabulous design is meant to inspire. Yet, when one enters the Manhattan home of actress Julianne Moore, the first impression is of surprising normality. Teenagers buzz about, doing whatever it is that teenagers do, and dogs bark affectionately for attention. The rooms possess the kind of engaging homeyness that emerges, seemingly without effort, in spaces where someone has paid close attention to proper scale, proportion, and period detail. There is no indoor lap pool, Turkish-style hammam, James Turrell skyspace, or any other conspicuously lavish signifier of luxury. It feels like a home\u2014delightfully, unapologetically normal.\n\n\u201cFor years I dreamed about living in a townhouse in the West Village,\u201d says the Oscar-winning actress, who lights up the big screen this fall with a hat trick of high-profile films: Todd Haynes\u2019s Wonderstruck, George Clooney\u2019s Suburbicon, and Matthew Vaughn\u2019s Kingsman: The Golden Circle. \u201cThe first time I walked into this one, I knew this was it\u2014I fell in love,\u201d Moore recalls. That was 15 years ago. At the time, the five-story house had been carved up into apartments, but the original front-and-back-parlor configuration was intact, as were the floors, shutters, fireplaces, and staircase. \u201cThere was enough character left that we could bring the house back to its Greek Revival roots without destroying the soul and texture of the building,\u201d Moore says.\n\nBottega Veneta black-and-tan butterfly dress; Giavanni Rossi heels; Chopard rings Photo by Alexi Lubomirski\n\nBefore the renovation began, Moore married her longtime partner, writer/director Bart Freundlich, in the garden at the rear of the house. Both of their children\u2014Cal, now 19 and a sophomore in college, and Liv, a 15-year-old high school student\u2014were present for the low-key ceremony, effectively putting the family\u2019s stamp on the property even before the clan moved in. In fact, the renovation itself was something of a family affair, orchestrated by Bart\u2019s architect brother, Oliver Freundlich, and his then-partners Ben Bischoff and Brian Papa, in collaboration with Moore, a passionate design junkie.\n\nThe makeover lasted a year and a half, after which the actress stocked the house with an enticing array of decorative treasures that evidence a distinct predilection for organic forms, warm materials, and spruce midcentury lines: a George Nakashima cocktail table, lamps by Isamu Noguchi, a Florence Knoll credenza with rattan doors, and a host of un-pedigreed but sympathetic vintage finds. \u201cI like things that have real personality and authenticity,\u201d Moore says. \u201cI hate a knockoff.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d2600f3ff54e1077a904a1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1117-AD-MOOR04-01_sq.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d25feb2e3c9565b2d88f01/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1117-AD-MOOR02-01_sq.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d2603f2e3c9565b2d88f0d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1117-AD-DNJM02-04.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d14c7086036b50008c0cc96/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/01%2520New%2520Museum_Daytime%2520View%2520Down%2520Prince%2520Street_OMA%2520and%2520Bloom-web.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0bb7c954d1b1089590f282/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/OT1247633.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0173486fc8633db117e621/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/1-Facade.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d03aff9b451b323dc1ae0b1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1148946770.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-reverse.13d6d4955ed232771a3c921b77513eaddd3ac58b.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d2600f3ff54e1077a904a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/1117-AD-MOOR04-01_sq.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d029605b451b373751adfb4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/380%2520S%2520Arroyo%2520Blvd_039.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-header.4beb0fb9c7bbd6bb98b552777bf0f8c6e71764c1.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d25fe83ff54e1077a9049b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1117-AD-MOOR01-01_sq.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d266b72e3c9565b2d88f1c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1117-AD-COVR02-01_sq.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d2640f2e3c9565b2d88f1a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1117-AD-DNJM01-06_sq.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0ce71abc91491c4b1a1daf/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/OT1256443.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d260402e3c9565b2d88f0f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1117-AD-DNJM02-10.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d25fe93ff54e1077a9049d/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/1117-AD-MOOR07-01_sq.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d07c5bac9f2f252a1f26cdd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-584261880.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0906b0aee365c0d7ac25c7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Charles%2520Zana%2520Portrait%25202%2520(1).jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59d2600f3ff54e1077a904a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/1117-AD-MOOR04-01_sq.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Madeleine Luckel", "Joyce Chen", "Jordi Lippe-Mcgraw", "Mayer Ru", "Fran\u00e7ois Dischinger", "Alexi Lubomirski", "Shoko Wanger", "Fred A.
