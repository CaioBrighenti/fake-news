We\u2019re gonna have to do a simulation.\u201d\n\nHold on. So Phelps wasn\u2019t going to actually race a shark in a TV event titled \u201cPhelps vs. Shark: Great Gold vs. Great White\u201d?! Why was the hour-long special billed as such?\n\nWhile common sense probably could have saved any disappointment \u2014 along with preshow interviews where Phelps assured everyone that he wouldn\u2019t really race next to a shark in open water \u2014 many viewers were not pleased.\n\nMichael Phelps race against a computer generated shark will go down as one of TV's most hyped flops. #gullibleTVviewers \u2014 PhantomAcct (@phantomacct) July 24, 2017\n\nphelps racing a fake shark is like when ur teacher says there's gonna be a sub but shows up the next day \u2014 \u30ea (@reqnna) July 24, 2017\n\nMichael Phelps has been hyping up that he's going to race a shark for months now. He did it tonight and it was a damn CGI shark #FakeNews \u2014 Cole Hill (@theSwoleCole) July 24, 2017\n\nMy friend was genuinely upset when I told her Phelps' shark was CGI lol \u2014 stupider time (@knifexparty) July 24, 2017\n\nThroughout the episode, viewers watched as Gutteridge and the team collected data about the swim speed of sharks, which is apparently very hard to do, because sharks don\u2019t typically swim in a straight line.\n\nSo, Gutteridge said, instead of Phelps and a shark swimming side by side, the scientists would use the speed data they obtained to create a computer-generated image of a shark racing. And Phelps would compete against that.\n\nUnacceptable, said the Internet.\n\nYOU SAID HE WOULD FACE A SHARK, NOT A CGI SHARK \u2014 Cindy (@ESPNCindy) July 24, 2017\n\nCall me crazy but I thought they were gonna put Phelps up against a real shark not a simulation. I feel robbed. #SharkWeek #PhelpsVsShark pic.twitter.com/XgdEphkl6m \u2014 \ud835\udcdc\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcf0 \ud835\udcd2.

Phelps lost.\n\nThe computer simulated great white shark swam 100 meters in 36.1 seconds. Phelps, fitted in a special wet suit and monofin that bound his feet together, took 38.1 seconds to swim the same distance. So close \u2014 but no dice.\n\nIT WAS A FAKE SHARK. Phelps raced a fake shark....and lost.\n\nI feel cheated #SharkWeek2017 pic.twitter.com/nEABV6PRNZ \u2014 Jessica Morrey (@JessicaMorrey) July 24, 2017\n\nwe just wasted a hour waiting to see micheal phelps swim against a computer generated shark, and lose \u2014 casmier (@kylecasmier) July 24, 2017\n\n#Spoiler #PhelpsVShark was essentially 58 minutes of fishing for sharks & 38 seconds of #Phelps in the water LOSING to a CGI #Shark. \ud83e\udd88\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb \u2014 James Campbell (@WHOtheFisJC) July 24, 2017\n\nReactions from the shark community after the Phelps/fake shark competition. pic.twitter.com/8vziyzWOjr \u2014 Bud Crawford Stan Account (@MikeSciandra) July 24, 2017\n\nPhelps looked disappointed, though not surprised. Earlier in the episode, when he saw a simulation of a 20-foot great white shark competing in an Olympic swimming pool, he knew it was a long shot. After all, the shark\u2019s average speed of 25 miles per hour was more than four times Phelps\u2019s own top speed in the pool.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the first thought that went through my head when I saw the shark, there\u2019s probably very little chance for me to beat him,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least Discovery had a sense of humor about this special, such as when the narrator mentioned Phelps\u2019s many Olympic accolades: \u201cSharks don\u2019t care about medals.\u201d And for those still upset about the CGI shark situation, just remember that whenever Discovery hypes something crazy happening with an animal \u2014 well, there may be a twist that makes it not quite as exciting as it seems.\n\nThe people mad Phelps raced an fake shark are the same people mad they used computer graphic plates in the live action Beauty and the Beast \u2014 Alfred Cohol (@Hombrevender) July 24, 2017\n\nRead more:\n\nShark weak: Michael Phelps loses race to computer-generated great white\n\nThe Phelps vs. shark charade was another bizarre episode of humans racing animals\n\nMichael Phelps\u2019s \u2018Shark Week\u2019 race against a great white has an intense trailer", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yDzxO8C486sCbyLZoqOrjlYpAGs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRZVLUGB4A6JBMB5VKGHSMARPY.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yDzxO8C486sCbyLZoqOrjlYpAGs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IRZVLUGB4A6JBMB5VKGHSMARPY.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture", "July", "Emily Yahr Is An Entertainment Reporter For The Washington Post.
