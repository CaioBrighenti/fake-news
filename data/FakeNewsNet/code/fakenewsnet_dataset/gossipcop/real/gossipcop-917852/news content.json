Did he just say Beau or Birthday? Ha ha... Daddy @imdeanmcdermott and I \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc76\ud83c\udffcYou SO much!!\" the former Beverly Hills, 90210 star captioned the clip.\n\nThe video comes after ET confirmed that police were called to the 44-year-old actress's family home in Woodland Hills, California, on Thursday, responding to a disturbance call earlier in the day.\n\nMcDermott also shared an equally adorable video of him singing happy birthday to his son.\n\nHe captioned the post, \"Time flys!!! This little dude is 1 today!!!! Happy Birthday Beau Dean McDermott!! We love you!! #littlerockstar #firstbirthday.\"\n\nA source told ET earlier this week that Spelling had a meltdown at her home due to multiple stress factors that she's currently dealing with.\n\n\u201cThere are several things that led up to this, and she really couldn't take the pressure any longer,\u201d the source said of Spelling. \u201cTori tries to be the best mom she can be, but with five children and terrible financial issues, her marriage has suffered tremendously.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, she and her husband have also been arguing over money and their five children. McDermott had left the house for a couple of days for a break, which is why when he came home on Wednesday night, Spelling thought there was a break-in.\n\nAn LAPD spokesperson confirmed to ET that there was a call for service of a burglary at Spelling's address on Wednesday night, but it was determined that there was no crime.\n\n\"She had no idea he had walked in the door and it scared her,\" the source said. \u201cShe is obsessed with trying to make her relationship with Dean work despite all their issues. Her breakdown came after she and Dean had been fighting. She literally was hysterical and, sadly, the kids were home and everyone was scared. ... She is under far too much pressure.\"\n\nFor more on the situation, watch below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nTori Spelling Had a 'Breakdown' Due to Stress of Marriage, Finances and Kids, Source Says (Exclusive)\n\nCorinne Olympios Says Tori Spelling Seemed 'Distant' Prior to Police Being Called to Her House (Exclusive)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Tori Spelling Says She's Open to Having a 6th Child, Gushes Over Relationship With Dean McDermott", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x169/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1242911076001_5743303108001_5743300171001-vs.jpg?itok=PlEmS6tF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2016-11/tori_spelling_538752936.jpg?itok=xFc90RBz", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-11/tori_spelling_538752936.jpg?itok=_OJoMvlg"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-11/tori_spelling_538752936.jpg?itok=_OJoMvlg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/tori-spelling-returns-to-social-media-following-alleged-breakdown-97505", "title": "Tori Spelling Returns to Social Media Following Alleged Breakdown", "meta_data": {"title": "Tori Spelling Returns to Social Media Following Alleged Breakdown | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tori-spelling-returns-to-social-media-following-alleged-breakdown-97505", "title": "Tori Spelling Returns to Social Media Following Alleged Breakdown", "description": "Police were called out to her California home on Thursday after responding to a disturbance call.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-11/tori_spelling_538752936.jpg?itok=_OJoMvlg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Police were called out to her California home on Thursday after responding to a disturbance call.", "title": "Tori Spelling Returns to Social Media Following Alleged Breakdown", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Liz Calvario\u200d \u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tori-spelling-returns-to-social-media-following-alleged-breakdown-97505", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-11/tori_spelling_538752936.jpg?itok=_OJoMvlg"}, "description": "Police were called out to her California home on Thursday after responding to a disturbance call.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Tori Spelling", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Tori Spelling"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
