You can see it right here. It\u2019s a little white circle,\u201d Glanville says in the video. \u201cI had laser hair removal on my upper lip, oh gosh, 2009, maybe 2008, and I got a third-degree burn. And my face on the right side doesn't move the way my face on the left side moves.\u201d\n\nYou May Also Like: This Botched Laser Hair Removal Proves It's a Treatment You Should Take Seriously\n\nNeedless to say, with laser hair removal being such a sought-after treatment, we were a little unnerved (ha!) to hear of this potentially paralyzing side effect. We tapped a couple facial plastic surgeons to get a better understanding of facial anatomy.\n\n\u201cTimeline-wise, it's not clear when the facial paralysis started after laser hair removal. However, while anything can happen, it would be unusual for facial paralysis to result from laser treatments, as the facial nerve is usually deeper to the level of the burn,\u201d explains Beverly Hills, CA facial plastic surgeon, Kimberly Lee, MD. \u201cWith deeper burns, sensory nerve endings can be affected, which can lead to numbness. The facial nerve is a motor nerve that is deeper and more robust than sensory nerves. To affect this nerve, the burn would have to be quite deep and substantial and would have to be located in the course of the nerve itself.\u201d\n\nNew York facial plastic surgeon Matthew White, MD agrees that while laser hair removal certainly isn\u2019t risk-free, it\u2019s not likely to cause facial paralysis. \u201cThe lasers used for hair removal can\u2019t penetrate deeply enough to damage the facial nerves directly,\u201d he explains. \u201cHowever, a laser could reactivate a virus, which can lead to Bell\u2019s Palsy, [a condition that does cause paralysis].\u201d\n\nBottom line: While it\u2019s not so clear-cut what might have happened, Glanville\u2019s experience is a reminder that all cosmetic procedures come with some risk of side effects. Seeing a qualified professional is crucial to ensuring you get the best results.", "images": ["https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/36264-hair-zoomed.jpg.256x195_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/83993-selfiesplasticsurgeryjpg.jpg.256x195_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/79202-thinhairmainpng.png.204x150_q80_crop-smart.png", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/38760-52857-traceeellisross-1pngpng.png.383x305_q80_crop-smart_upscale.png", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/21099-beauty2019png.png.204x150_q80_crop-smart.png", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/14407-birthcontrolherojpg.jpg.204x150_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/16419-vickipng.png.383x305_q80_crop-smart_upscale.png", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newbeauty.com/tt-banner-left-v10.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newbeauty.com/tt-banner-right-v10.jpg", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/41457-brandipng.png", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/41457-brandipng.png.660x0_q80_crop-scale_upscale.png", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/67482-shutterstock_557345986jpg.jpg.256x195_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/97556-heropng.png.204x150_q80_crop-smart.png", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/1797-47090-kellydodd-1pngpng.png.383x305_q80_crop-smart_upscale.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21004701&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1572440699746061&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/54779-thumb almonds.jpg.256x195_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/70895-hero2png.png.204x150_q80_crop-smart.png"], "top_img": "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/41457-brandipng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carolyn Hsu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newbeauty.com/blog/dailybeauty/12114-brandi-glanville-claims-laser-hair-removal-paralyzed-half-her-face/", "title": "Brandi Glanville Claims This Noninvasive Procedure Paralyzed Half Her Face", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Brandi Glanville reveals that she had suffered third-degree burns from a laser hair removal treatment gone wrong, causing facial paralysis on half of her mouth.", "og": {"title": "Brandi Glanville Claims This Noninvasive Procedure Paralyzed Half Her Face", "site_name": "NewBeauty", "image": "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/41457-brandipng.png", "url": "https://www.newbeauty.com/blog/dailybeauty/12114-brandi-glanville-claims-laser-hair-removal-paralyzed-half-her-face/", "description": "Facial plastic surgeons aren\u2019t so sure, however.", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 957932114216881}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewBeauty", "creator": "@NewBeauty", "title": "Brandi Glanville Claims This Noninvasive Procedure Paralyzed Half Her Face", "description": "<p>Facial plastic surgeons aren\u2019t so sure, however.<br></p>", "image": {"src": "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/41457-brandipng.png"}}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRpp9Ah_7h0"], "publish_date": 1522641600.0, "source": "https://www.newbeauty.com", "summary": ""}
