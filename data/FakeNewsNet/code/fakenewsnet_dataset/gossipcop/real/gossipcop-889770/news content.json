Bell and Kunis provide some chuckle-worthy answers and commentary until one woman, Ayesha Dixon, stands up to ask a question. Dixon takes the mic but doesn\u2019t ask the ladies a question. Instead, she expresses gratitude and specifically thanks DeGeneres for \u201cchanging her life.\u201d\n\nCut to DeGeneres, Hahn, Bell and Kunis insisting that Dixon come onstage so they can all give her a hug. Naturally, Ellen then reveals she has a little something up her cashmere cardigan sleeves and\u2014whaddaya know\u2014out walks Dixon\u2019s mom from backstage.\n\nFighting back tears, Dixon talks about her 2-year-old daughter and how she struggles to keep up with her bills. Right on cue, Kunis reaches behind DeGeneres\u2019s couch and pulls out a large red stocking with $25,000 in cash. She says, \u201cOur movie is all about celebrating moms and celebrating how hard it is to be a mom. So we just wanted to help you out a little bit, because you\u2019re an awesome mom and you\u2019re an awesome mom. So, for you guys, don\u2019t peek. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Next, Bell reaches behind the couch and pulls out another stocking stuffed with $25,000 in cash.\n\nCome on, you saw this one coming. Hahn chimes in and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you guys. I do not mean to be a downer, but I\u2019m feeling a little bit left out at the moment.\u201d That\u2019s right: She, too, reaches behind the couch and pulls out a third stocking stuffed with $25,000.\n\nAnd then there was one. Of course DeGeneres gets in on the action (it is her show, after all) and gives Dixon a fourth $25,000-stuffed stocking for a grand total of $100,000.\n\nJust your average Friday of being awesome for DeGeneres and the Bad Moms.\n\nA Bad Moms Christmas hits theaters on November 3.\n\nRELATED: Ellen DeGeneres Crashes Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Show Wearing That Plunging Green Versace Dress", "images": ["https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2019_02/pw_white_logo.png?auto=format,compress&cs=strip", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1305835412842913&ev=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15961801&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.purewow.com/v_2013/images/snapcode.svg", "https://d3d127vhjgkwcw.cloudfront.net/images/articles/2017_10/Mila_Kunis_Kristen_Bell_Ellen_DeGeneres_surprise_600.jpg", "https://d3d127vhjgkwcw.cloudfront.net/images/articles/2017_10/alexander_skarsgard_category.jpg", "https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2019_02/fb_login.png?auto=format,compress&cs=strip", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1305835412842913&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://d3d127vhjgkwcw.cloudfront.net/images/articles/2017_11/theCoterie-logo.svg", "https://d1glun6kjhlyhe.cloudfront.net/v_2013/images/thegist-white-salmonbar.svg", "https://d1glun6kjhlyhe.cloudfront.net/v_2013/images/subscribe-mailbox-icon.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d3d127vhjgkwcw.cloudfront.net/images/articles/2017_10/Mila_Kunis_Kristen_Bell_Ellen_DeGeneres_surprise_600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Greta Heggeness"], "canonical_link": "https://www.purewow.com/news/mila-kunis-kristen-bell-ellen-surprise-single-mom", "title": "Ellen & the 'Bad Moms' Teamed Up to Surprise a Single Mom", "meta_data": {"thumbnail": "https://purewows3.imgix.net/images/articles/2017_10/Mila_Kunis_Kristen_Bell_Ellen_DeGeneres_surprise_400.jpg?auto=format,compress&fit=min&w=176&h=127", "title": "Ellen & the 'Bad Moms' Teamed Up to Surprise a Single Mom - PureWow", "description": "Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn took a break from their 'Bad Moms' antics to give one lucky single mom an early Christmas gift.", "keywords": "news, celebrity , entertainment, movies, Kathryn Hahn, Bad Moms, Ellen DeGeneres, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, A Bad Moms Christmas, Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell", "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-27T17:12:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-27T18:12:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PureWow"}, "google-site-verification": "_IUzbA1brhr5VAZoM_6knrRArtmPwibJlBjtditOZeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 410092635715198, "admins": 6908585, "pages": "134570403224681,251502288549594,1733023133584949,547492415455789"}, "og": {"site_name": "PureWow", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.purewow.com/news/mila-kunis-kristen-bell-ellen-surprise-single-mom", "title": "Dazzling Humans Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis & Kathryn Hahn Surprise a Single Mom on \u2018Ellen\u2019 and It's Beautiful", "image": {"identifier": "https://d3d127vhjgkwcw.cloudfront.net/images/articles/2017_10/Mila_Kunis_Kristen_Bell_Ellen_DeGeneres_surprise_600.jpg", "height": 315, "width": 600}, "description": ""}, "twitter": {"card": "player", "site": "@PureWow", "title": "Dazzling Humans Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis & Kathryn Hahn Surprise a Single Mom on \u2018Ellen\u2019 and It's Beautiful", "description": "", "url": "https://www.purewow.com/news/mila-kunis-kristen-bell-ellen-surprise-single-mom", "player": {"identifier": "https:https://www.youtube.com/embed/vca66JrHG3s", "width": 480, "height": 300}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509138720.0, "source": "https://www.purewow.com", "summary": ""}
