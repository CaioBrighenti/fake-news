Among the named alleged accomplices was Riverdale actor Ross Butler. In an October 9 court filing, reviewed by Spin and first reported by The Blast, Butler denies the wild allegations in Silva\u2019s suit, but admits he visited Silva\u2019s house with Lutfi on the night in question. That\u2019s about the only detail Butler\u2019s version of the story shares with Silva\u2019s account.\n\nSilva and Frances Bean Cobain have fought legally for years over the rights to her father\u2019s famous 1959 Martin D-18E guitar, which is rumored to be worth millions. Silva, who plays in The Eeeries, has said that Frances Bean gave the guitar to him as a wedding present. Love told TMZ in 2016 that the instrument was a \u201ctreasured heirloom of the family\u201d and that Frances \u201cnever planned on doing that.\u201d In May, the guitar was awarded to Silva in a divorce settlement.\n\nButler\u2019s role in the saga is not exactly clear. In his recent court filing, the actor declares that on June 2, 2016, Lutfi picked him up in a car driven by one Yan Yukhtman, another defendant named in Silva\u2019s suit. Lutfi allegedly told Butler that he was concerned about Frances Bean and her then-husband Silva after receiving \u201ctroubling text messages,\u201d and headed to the house for a check-in. Blankets or sheets covered all of the home\u2019s windows, Butler says, and no one responded to their knocks on the front door, but they heard sounds from upstairs. At this point, Butler says he returned to the street and Lutfi \u201cwent to investigate\u201d; his statement doesn\u2019t clarify whether Lutfi physically entered the building. About five to ten minutes later, an alarm in the house sounded, Butler heard the front door open and someone call for him to come inside, and he entered the house, where he claims to have been \u201cgreeted calmly and amicably by Silva.\u201d\n\nAccording to Butler\u2019s declaration, the house was \u201cmessy\u201d and had a \u201cbad odor\u201d and Silva appeared \u201cfrail, emaciated\u201d and smelled, too. Silva and Lutfi allegedly spoke for a few minutes in the kitchen, during which time Butler noticed a second person, referred to as Mr. Munsey, leave the house. Eventually Silva, Lutfi, and Butler left, too, planning to get food and continue their conversation. But before they drove away, Munsey pulled up next to Lutfi\u2019s car and announced he had called the police. Officers arrived, questioned everyone, and left. At that point, according to Butler, Silva and Lutfi went back inside and Butler himself left. He denies conspiring to commit any crime against Silva, breaking or entering the house, attempting to murder Silva, hacking Silva\u2019s phone, and all other criminal allegations made in the original lawsuit. He is asking for all claims against him to be dismissed.\n\nThe next hearing for the case is scheduled on December 7.
