It\u2019s not lost on me that God gave me this opportunity, this platform to speak about these issues. I really feel like it was a calling, it\u2019s not an accident I came on this show,\u201d Hargitay told E! News at The Joyful Heart Foundation gala. \u201cI always wanted to be on service, but it\u2019s hard. You say, \u2018What do I do? How do I be of service?\u2019 and this was an opportunity.\u201d\n\nHargitay said she was unaware of the sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse statistics until she started on SVUand she wondered why more people weren\u2019t talking about the \u201cepidemic in our country.\u201d And then SVU became a platform and a venue to encourage dialogue, to shed light on issues often swept under the rug for a variety of reasons. Hargitay started The Joyful Heart Foundation because of what she learned from her time playing Benson. \u201cThe Joyful Heart Foundation is about the possibility, it\u2019s about joy, it\u2019s about reclaiming your life,\u201d she said. Law & Order: SVU will return for a season 19 on NBC, making it the longest-running drama currently on air.", "images": ["https://www.y103fm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ed-married-214x140.jpg", "https://www.y103fm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rih-troll-214x140.jpg", "https://www.y103fm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Y-Banner_Jan2018.jpg", "https://www.y103fm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/klum-married-214x140.jpg", "https://www.y103fm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/y-logo-150x150.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/44eb7b971486eeb94d1257c9c7e8e74e?s=100&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.y103fm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mariska-Hargitay.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.y103fm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/y-logo-150x150.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gaynelle Marshall"], "canonical_link": "https://www.y103fm.com/entertainment/why-mariska-hargitay-considers-law-order-svu-her-calling/", "title": "Why Mariska Hargitay Considers Law & Order: SVU Her \u201cCalling\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.0.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.y103fm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/y-logo.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495631535.0, "source": "https://www.y103fm.com", "summary": ""}
