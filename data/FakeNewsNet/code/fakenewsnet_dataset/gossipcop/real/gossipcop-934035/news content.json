More specifically, she carried them with her: Lively had a Judith Leiber clutch custom-made with the Reynolds family crest.\n\nIf you look closely, you'll see that Lively's rhinestone-embellished handbag has intricate scenes depicted on either side. On the front, it's classic \"sacred heart\" iconography behind a veiled woman, in keeping with the theme of this year's Costume Institute exhibit, \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"; on the other, there's a riff on a medieval family crest, which, at the very center of a scroll, reads \"Reynolds.\"\n\nHere's a close-up of both sides of Lively's clutch.\n\nCourtesy of Judith Leiber\n\nCourtesy of Judith Leiber\n\nThe Reynolds crest is in the shape of a cross, and on each of the four points there's a jewel with a letter in the middle: B, R, J, and I\u2014the first initials of each member of the Reynolds-Lively family. Does this count as James and Ines's first Met Gala appearance?", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed39295117594719a051/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955783218.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d971f11040d8257aedec62/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/pne%2520day.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1ca44da581030009968476/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1159638751.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d07fc5dcf7bcf330891a7a3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1139930852.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d2602e96966c50008c493a7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1153778350.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed392865d05a333a2d8c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Seamless%252520Sacred%252520Heart%252520Back%252520MET.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f3c61d01a66b5bdeb03d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955783218.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d12639bbcde9d0c440cd5e6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kylie-jenner.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed391d01a66b5bdeb037/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955778036.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed39295117594719a052/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Seamless%252520Sacred%252520Heart%252520Front%252520MET.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa", "Anna Moeslein", "Andrea Par", "Molly Jong-Fast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/blake-lively-met-gala-2018-outfit-hidden-message", "title": "The Hidden Message You Probably Missed in Blake Lively's Met Gala 2018 Outfit", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "At the 2018 Met Gala, Blake Lively carried a clutch decorated with the initials of her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and their daughters, James and Ines.", "keywords": "snd,Blake Lively,met gala,Ryan Reynolds", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Ryan Reynolds and the couple's daughters were with her in spirit.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "You Probably Missed the Sweet Family Tribute in Blake Lively's Met Gala Outfit", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/blake-lively-met-gala-2018-outfit-hidden-message"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ryan Reynolds and the couple's daughters were with her in spirit.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "You Probably Missed the Sweet Family Tribute in Blake Lively's Met Gala Outfit"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
