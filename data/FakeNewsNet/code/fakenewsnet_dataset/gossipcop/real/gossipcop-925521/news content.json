Since Ledger's passing, life has not been the same for his former girlfriend Michelle Williams, who's the mother to his 12-year-old daughter, Matilda. \"It just won't ever be right,\" Williams has said of raising their daughter alone.\n\nBut when the milestone anniversary of Ledger's death rolled around, Williams' close friend Busy Philipps did her best to comfort her grieving pal, flying to San Francisco to be by her side. On that January day, Philipps \u2014 who has a huge following on social media \u2014 posted a photo of Williams nuzzling her shoulder. Her caption: \"It's OK.\" She'd also posted an Instagram story of herself crying as she drove around listening to a song that reminded her of Ledger.\n\nA post shared by Busy Philipps (@busyphilipps) on Jan 22, 2018 at 10:27pm PST\n\nReactions to the posts were mixed, with some fans seeming to think that Philipps was capitalizing on the tragedy for her own personal gain. \"I think some people felt like I was being exploitative,\u201d she told The Cut. \u201cI\u2019ve never even really spoken about [Ledger\u2019s death], because I never would want to have it be misconstrued in that way, but it was the ten-year anniversary.\"\n\nReportedly crying through the rest of her statement, Philipps said: \"It\u2019s just been a long ten years, you know? That anniversary just brought up a lot of \u2026 I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s been ten years. I was pregnant with Birdie. I had seen him a couple months earlier, and you know, [Williams and Ledger] were broken up. I\u2019ve never talked about it. I\u2019ve never shared it, because I\u2019m hyper protective of [Williams] and her daughter. But I also think \u2026 I think it\u2019s okay. Everyone\u2019s allowed to have their own feelings about something that happens.\"", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-05/bravo-con-homepage_1_0.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/personal-space-busy-phillips-heath-ledger.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/briana-ryan-culberson-grocery-shopping.jpg?itok=QiQLmgVL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/1021/703/190709_3985566_Andy_Cohen_Reacts_to_Lisa_Vanderpump_s_Absen.jpg?itok=lNfk2wvQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=8qj_CxiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2016/11/personal-space-michelle-williams.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/personal-space-amanda-batula-kyle-cook.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/08/peronal-space-dorinda-medley-luann-friendship-1.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/bethenny-frankel-dennis-boyfriend-relationship.jpg?itok=lhAbi1mh", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=sLRmUfZw", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/10/dish-101317-michelle-williams-busy-philipps.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=xsrzukj3", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/225/655/190710_3986181_What_You_Didn_t_See_Ashley_Jacobs_Do_at_the_.jpg?itok=6y25G9ie", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/shep-jax-brittany-wedding-gift.jpg?itok=GZKJCd9z", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/tommy-mj-mercedes-javid-parenting.jpg?itok=FAqXUSFV", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/personal-space-married-5-times-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/dorit-kemsley-morgan-stewart-look-alikes_0.jpg?itok=uElmmY9J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/12/personal-space-teresa-guidice-gia-college.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/brandi-redmond-baby-rhod-adoption.jpg?itok=g7_Bn4aE", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/field_blog_image/2018/04/personal-space-busy-phillips-heath-ledger.jpg?itok=8fhfaqfV"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/personal-space-busy-phillips-heath-ledger.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenny Berg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/busy-philipps-responds-to-backlash-over-post-on-anniversary-of-heath-ledgers-death", "title": "Busy Philipps Responds to Backlash Over Her Post on the Anniversary of Heath Ledger's Death", "meta_data": {"title": "Busy Philipps Responds to Backlash Over Heath Ledger Post | Personal Space", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "It's been 10 years since Heath Ledger died of an accidental drug overdose.
