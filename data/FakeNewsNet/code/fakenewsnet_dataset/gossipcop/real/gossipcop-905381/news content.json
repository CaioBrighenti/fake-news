{"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018", "text": "On a moist South Florida morning at the end of a relentless hurricane season, their wedding only a week away, Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian are seated side by side at their long kitchen table discussing the Marshmallow Test. Some 50 years ago, in a famous experiment, the Stanford University psychologist Walter Mischel invited children to choose between a small immediate reward, such as a marshmallow, or, if they could sit and wait for fifteen minutes, a larger prize. The children who found ways to stave off temptation\u2014by singing songs or pulling pigtails\u2014went on to have higher SAT scores and lower body-mass indexes than their ravenous peers.\n\n\u201cI would have eaten that marshmallow,\u201d says Serena, who, in conspicuous contrast to that image, sips a radioactive-looking broth, which she nudged her chef to prepare after reading online that ginger and turmeric were supposed to aid in breast-milk production. She positions this tincture on a stack of gold lam\u00e9 swatches: Golden Harvest, Gold L\u2019Amour, Golden Daydream, Victorian Gold. One of these will be selected for the tablecloths at the wedding dinner. Thinking better of her coaster choice, she shifts her glass to a stack of photocopied pages from assorted newborn instruction manuals. Serena loves printing and collating and stacking. She loves paper. She is the analog to her husband-to-be\u2019s digital.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Alexis shoots back. \u201cYou would never eat that marshmallow. You would stare down that marshmallow like it was the enemy. It would be Serena versus the marshmallow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she admits with a squeak of laughter. \u201cBut it would have been fear. I would have been scared to eat it. I would have been like, Am I supposed to eat this? Am I going to get in trouble if I eat this?\u201d\n\nWatch Serena Williams Absolutely Tear Up an Airport Runway:\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that a high capacity to delay gratification\u2014to place discipline and self-sacrifice in the service of a dream that shimmers in the distance like a mirage\u2014is among the distinguishing characteristics of the elite athlete. Serena is a special case, of course, an athlete whose unique gifts fused with years of hard work to produce an avalanche of victories\u2014more, she swears, than she ever dreamed of as a braided nine-year-old captured uncomfortably in the pages of her local newspaper. A more painful vision of reality has also encroached over the years: the drive-by murder of her older sister Yetunde Price, in 2003; a slip on a piece of broken glass at a Munich restaurant that led to pulmonary embolisms, which in turn led to a year on the sidelines (and then, somehow, after age 30, the five most brilliant seasons of her career). One gratification she always knew she\u2019d be keeping on the back burner was motherhood. But on September 1, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. arrived. Serena calls her Olympia. Alexis prefers Junior.\n\nMonths earlier, when she was pregnant, Serena had confessed to me that she worried intensely about whether she\u2019d make a good mother. She is a perfectionist, she is rule-bound (\u201cAm I allowed to eat that marshmallow?\u201d), and her longtime fans know that her fiery self-belief is sometimes undercut with self-doubt; in fact, that tension is part of what makes a Serena Williams match such nail-biting entertainment. Two rather harrowing months after giving birth, though, Mother has her sea legs\u2014just in time to get those legs back onto the tennis court. From her new vantage point, Olympia is both irresistible temptation and ultimate reality check.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not spending a day apart until she\u2019s eighteen,\u201d Serena says, only half-joking. \u201cNow that I\u2019m 36 and I look at my baby, I remember that this was also one of my goals when I was little, before tennis took over, when I was still kind of a normal girl who played with dolls. Oh, my God, I loved my dolls.\u201d She breaks into the jingle for Baby Alive, the doll with an eerie array of lifelike bodily functions: \u201cI love the way you make me feel,\u201d she croons in a cracking falsetto. \u201cYou\u2019re so real.\u201d Serena named her Baby Alive Victoria, drawn even then to triumphal monikers. Suddenly, shrieking with laughter, she\u2019s on YouTube watching eighties TV commercials in which little girls in soft focus change their dolls\u2019 wet diapers.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, there\u2019s something really attractive about the idea of moving to San Francisco and just being a mom,\u201d she says. Reddit, the news aggregator of which Alexis is a cofounder, is based there, and they\u2019ve just found a house in Silicon Valley. \u201cBut not yet. Maybe this goes without saying, but it needs to be said in a powerful way: I absolutely want more Grand Slams. I\u2019m well aware of the record books, unfortunately. It\u2019s not a secret that I have my sights on 25.\u201d She means 25 Grand Slam victories, which would surpass the record of 24 held by the Australian tennis legend Margaret Court and make her the undisputed greatest of all time. (Serena, already widely regarded as the best there ever was, currently owns 23.) \u201cAnd actually, I think having a baby might help. When I\u2019m too anxious I lose matches, and I feel like a lot of that anxiety disappeared when Olympia was born. Knowing I\u2019ve got this beautiful baby to go home to makes me feel like I don\u2019t have to play another match. I don\u2019t need the money or the titles or the prestige. I want them, but I don\u2019t need them. That\u2019s a different feeling for me.\u201d\n\nSerena changes into leggings and a T-shirt, and we walk over to the manicured red clay tennis court belonging to a neighbor, hers whenever she wants it. It\u2019s only the third time she\u2019s picked up a racket since giving birth. Her father, Richard Williams, drops by to have a look and to offer a pointer or two. Get your racket back earlier, he advises. Alexis has brought his drone, which sounds like a swarm of bees as it whirs above the court grabbing video footage of the champion and her hitting partner. (\u201cSerena doesn\u2019t dwell on this stuff, but I\u2019m making a point to document it all,\u201d he explains.) She\u2019s not serving yet, and there\u2019s no split-step as she prepares for another ground stroke, but the shots hiss into the corners, and she\u2019s pleased. Just a week earlier, Serena walked the length of a neighborhood block for the first time since returning from the hospital.\n\nThough she had an enviably easy pregnancy, what followed was the greatest medical ordeal of a life that has been punctuated by them. Olympia was born by emergency C-section after her heart rate dove dangerously low during contractions. The surgery went off without a hitch; Alexis cut the cord, and the wailing newborn fell silent the moment she was laid on her mother\u2019s chest. \u201cThat was an amazing feeling,\u201d Serena remembers. \u201cAnd then everything went bad.\u201d\n\nThe next day, while recovering in the hospital, Serena suddenly felt short of breath. Because of her history of blood clots, and because she was off her daily anticoagulant regimen due to the recent surgery, she immediately assumed she was having another pulmonary embolism. (Serena lives in fear of blood clots.) She walked out of the hospital room so her mother wouldn\u2019t worry and told the nearest nurse, between gasps, that she needed a CT scan with contrast and IV heparin (a blood thinner) right away. The nurse thought her pain medicine might be making her confused. But Serena insisted, and soon enough a doctor was performing an ultrasound of her legs. \u201cI was like, a Doppler? I told you, I need a CT scan and a heparin drip,\u201d she remembers telling the team. The ultrasound revealed nothing, so they sent her for the CT, and sure enough, several small blood clots had settled in her lungs. Minutes later she was on the drip. \u201cI was like, listen to Dr. Williams!\u201d\n\nBut this was just the first chapter of a six-day drama. Her fresh C-section wound popped open from the intense coughing spells caused by the pulmonary embolism, and when she returned to surgery, they found that a large hematoma had flooded her abdomen, the result of a medical catch-22 in which the potentially lifesaving blood thinner caused hemorrhaging at the site of her C-section. She returned yet again to the OR to have a filter inserted into a major vein, in order to prevent more clots from dislodging and traveling into her lungs. Serena came home a week later only to find that the night nurse had fallen through, and she spent the first six weeks of motherhood unable to get out of bed. \u201cI was happy to change diapers,\u201d Alexis says, \u201cbut on top of everything she was going through, the feeling of not being able to help made it even harder. Consider for a moment that your body is one of the greatest things on this planet, and you\u2019re trapped in it.\u201d\n\nThe first couple of months of motherhood have tested Serena in ways she never imagined. \u201cSometimes I get really down and feel like, Man, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s that same negative attitude I have on the court sometimes. I guess that\u2019s just who I am. No one talks about the low moments\u2014the pressure you feel, the incredible letdown every time you hear the baby cry. I\u2019ve broken down I don\u2019t know how many times. Or I\u2019ll get angry about the crying, then sad about being angry, and then guilty, like, Why do I feel so sad when I have a beautiful baby? The emotions are insane.\u201d Her mother, Oracene Price, has been staying in Florida to help out. She has encouraged Serena to relax around her daughter and is making the case for a strict parenting style in an era in which children often have the last word. \u201cObedience brings protection; that\u2019s what my mom told me,\u201d Serena says. \u201cThat\u2019s straight from the Bible, and she wrote it down on paper and gave it to me. I was always obedient: Whatever my parents told me to do, I did. There was no discussion. Maybe I had a little rebellious phase in my 20s, when I tried liquor for the first time. Maybe having a baby on the tennis tour is the most rebellious thing I could ever do.\u201d\n\nOracene says that she mainly bites her tongue, that daughters don\u2019t tend to respond well to parenting advice from their own moms. Her primary concern right now is that Serena find a healthy equilibrium. \u201cSerena works herself too hard,\u201d Oracene explains. \u201cShe\u2019s always been that way, ever since she was a little girl. She\u2019s going to need to learn to slow down. She\u2019s responsible for another life now. You should see how they travel with that baby. They pack everything! It\u2019s a bit extravagant for me. But once she\u2019s back on the tour, she\u2019ll find a balance.\u201d\n\nHer tennis friends have been broadly supportive, especially the dads. Stanislas Wawrinka gave Olympia a pair of tiny blue Tod\u2019s driving loafers, and Novak Djokovic continues to send articles in accordance with his everything-natural philosophy. Serena and Novak call their babies doubles partners since they were born a day apart. Roger Federer, in some respects her only real rival on the tour\u2014the person she\u2019s always sought to keep pace with, the person she refuses to retire before\u2014now has two sets of twins. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair,\u201d Se\u00adrena complains. \u201cHe produced four babies and barely missed a tournament. I can\u2019t even imagine where I\u2019d be with twins right now. Probably at the bottom of the pool.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg is a longtime hero of Serena\u2019s, and in the last year she has offered invaluable advice about marriage and motherhood. The two met years ago after Serena, in an interview, was asked to name someone she\u2019d like to have dinner with and chose Sandberg. \u201cI saw that, and I called her and said, \u2018I\u2019d love to have dinner with you!\u2019 \u201d Sandberg recalls. They did not become close until after Sandberg\u2019s husband, Dave Goldberg, died unexpectedly in 2015. \u201cSerena really stepped up. I\u2019d get texts and emails from her from all over the world telling me how strong I was at a time when I didn\u2019t feel strong. She had experienced loss in her own life, and I think she knew what to do.\u201d\n\nMany of her friends from women\u2019s tennis\u2014Caroline Wozniacki, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Angelique Kerber\u2014have reached out to remind her how much she\u2019s been missed this year. This is hugely important to Serena, who insists that contrary to the rumors, this is a group of women that genuinely cares for and respects one another. \u201cI really believe that we have to build each other up and build our tour up,\u201d she says. \u201cThe women in Billie Jean King\u2019s day supported each other even though they competed fiercely. We\u2019ve got to do that. That\u2019s kind of the mark I want to leave. Play each other hard, but keep growing the sport.\u201d\n\nBack at the house, Olympia has awoken from her nap. Serena lays her on a play mat in the TV room so that they can do some tandem exercises while Chip, the Yorkie, runs in circles around them, eager to get in on the action. Mother tests out a few crunches, but her stomach is still too weak; baby kicks out her chubby legs a few times, which proves irresistible to Serena, who rolls over and grabs them. \u201cThey\u2019re not calves!\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re not ankles! What are they? That\u2019s right\u2014Mommy loves your cankles!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she got them from me,\u201d says Alexis, overhearing, from the next room.\n\nOlympia tries to wriggle out of the baby gym, with its dumbbell-shaped rattles, but Serena says not so fast. \u201cSome other seven-week-old is in the gym right now working,\u201d she jokes. But she has no wish to push her daughter onto the court. To her mother\u2019s horror, Olympia sat transfixed by the Argentine star Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro recently. \u201cI was distraught when I saw her,\u201d says Se\u00adrena. \u201cI would hate her to have to deal with comparisons or expectations. It\u2019s so much work, and I\u2019ve given up so much. I don\u2019t regret it, but it\u2019s like Sliding Doors: Go through a different door and lead a different life. I\u2019d like her to have a normal life. I didn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obviously going to have a very special life,\u201d Alexis says, \u201cbut there are enough cautionary tales about kids who grow up in the spotlight. How do you make your kid live in reality when your own reality is so . . . unreal? This kid is going to have more Instagram followers than me in about three weeks.\u201d (At press time, baby was narrowing her father\u2019s lead.)\n\nThe biggest question in women\u2019s tennis last year was who would end up number one in Serena\u2019s absence, and the answer didn\u2019t become clear until the penultimate day of the season, when Serena\u2019s friend Simona Halep, of Romania, snuck off with the crown. It could have been anybody, really, including the tour\u2019s elder stateswoman, Venus Williams, who at age 37 was a couple of victories from the number-one ranking. The fact that Venus\u2019s extraordinary year coincided with Serena\u2019s absence from the tour is not lost on her younger sister. \u201cI know that her career might have been different if she had had my health,\u201d Serena says, clinging to the fantasy of sisterly parity. \u201cI know how hard she works. I hate playing her because she gets this look on her face where she just looks sad if she\u2019s losing. Solemn. It breaks my heart. So when I play her now, I absolutely don\u2019t look at her, because if she gets that look, then I\u2019ll start feeling bad, and the next thing you know I\u2019ll be losing. I think that\u2019s when the turning point came in our rivalry, when I stopped looking at her.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that dominant number ones like Serena are rare, and no one has made a bold declaration during her absence. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d she muses. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a clear number one since I was there. It will be cool to see if I get there again, to what I call my spot\u2014where I feel I belong. I don\u2019t play to be the second best or the third best. If there\u2019s no clear number one, it\u2019s like, yeah, I can get my spot back. But if there is a clear number one, that\u2019s cool, too, because it\u2019s like, yeah, I\u2019m gonna come for you.\u201d\n\nSerena is never more lethal than when she zeroes in on a target. (Just ask Maria Sharapova.) She had hoped to defend her Australian Open title in January, but the recent medical gantlet has forced her to move her return date to March, where she\u2019d like to play for the trophy at Indian Wells. She has set her sights beyond the tennis court as well. She will debut a new clothing line in March on her website. She continues to invest in tech ventures owned or led by women and African Americans. Her philanthropic endeavors focus on education and helping victims of violence and trauma. Although she thinks she\u2019d be a terrible tennis coach, she imagines it would be gratifying to mentor an emerging player. (She admires the young and powerful Russian Daria Kasatkina.) And she would like to have more children, though she\u2019s in no rush.\n\n\u201cI remember how stressed I was about getting to Grand Slam number eighteen, tying Chrissie and Martina,\u201d she says. \u201cI had lost every Grand Slam that year. I was in the U.S. Open, and Patrick [Mouratoglou], my coach, said, \u2018Serena, this doesn\u2019t make sense. You\u2019re so stressed about eighteen. Why not 30? Why not 40?\u2019 For me, that clicked. I won eighteen, nineteen, and 20 right after that. Why would I want to stand side by side when I can stand out on my own? I think sometimes women limit themselves. I\u2019m not sure why we think that way, but I know that we\u2019re sometimes taught to not dream as big as men, not to believe we can be a president or a CEO, when in the same household, a male child is told he can be anything he wants. I\u2019m so glad I had a daughter. I want to teach her that there are no limits.\u201d\n\nRecently Serena agreed to sit on the board of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative, whose mission is to nurture a more diverse and inclusive corps of future leaders. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling people that I think Serena, with her prowess and her platform, can do more than I ever dreamed of\u2014not just for women or for people of color but for all people,\u201d says King. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out who I\u2019m going to pass the torch to. Serena\u2019s speaking like a leader and talking about making a difference in the world. Personally I\u2019d like to see her get into politics. Why not run for president? But first I\u2019d like to see her break every record\u2014to be the big kahuna.\u201d\n\nFor guests at Serena and Alexis\u2019s wedding, on a Thursday last November at New Orleans\u2019s Contemporary Arts Center, it was hard not to be knocked over by the collective power of the assembled women, among them Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Caroline Wozniacki, Eva Longoria, Kim Kardashian West, and Ciara. The Tony Award\u2013winning singer-actress Cynthia Erivo delivered a knockout rendition of \u201c(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\u201d at the reception. \u201cI never wanted a traditional wedding,\u201d Serena says. \u201cI wanted a strong wedding.\u201d\n\nStrength is much more than a mere physical detail for Serena Williams; it is a guiding principle. She had it in mind last summer as she considered what to call her baby, Googling names that derive from words for strong in a mix of languages before settling on something Greek. But with Olympia home and healthy and the wedding behind her, it\u2019s time to shift focus to her day job. She knows that she\u2019s hurtling toward immortality, and she doesn\u2019t take it lightly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing tennis since before my memories started,\u201d she says. \u201cAt my age, I see the finish line. And when you see the finish line, you don\u2019t slow down. You speed up.\u201d\n\nGet the February issue now.\n\nWatch: Serena Williams & Alexis Ohanian on Their Future Plans:", "images": ["https://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/pass/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/pass/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rob Haskell", "Mario Testino"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback", "description": "Serena Williams, Vogue\u2019s February 2018 cover star discusses her difficult delivery for the first time and when she hopes to make her triumphant return to tennis.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/pass/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback - Vogue", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/pass/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Serena Williams, Vogue\u2019s February 2018 cover star discusses her difficult delivery for the first time and when she hopes to make her triumphant return to tennis."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "description": "Serena Williams, Vogue\u2019s February 2018 cover star discusses her difficult delivery for the first time and when she hopes to make her triumphant return to tennis.", "keywords": "Magazine,Sports,Serena Williams,_sensitivecontent,_syndication_noshow,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Magazine,Sports,Serena Williams,_sensitivecontent,_syndication_noshow,mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Magazine", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515589216.573, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
