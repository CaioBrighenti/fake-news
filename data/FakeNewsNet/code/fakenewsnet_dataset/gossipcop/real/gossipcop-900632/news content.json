They haven't.\n\n\"But it's good, it's good,\" Sheeran said.\n\nSheeran wouldn't reveal the name of his Bond song because \"someone might steal it.\" (Robb Cohen/Robb Cohen/Invision/AP)\n\nIt's understandable why Sheeran or any other musician would want to write and perform a song for the iconic film series \u2014 it would add the singer to a collection of superstars like Tina Turner, Madonna, Shirley Bassey and Paul McCartney. In recent years Bond songs like Adele's \"Skyfall\" and Sam Smith's \"Writing's on the Wall\" netted Oscars.\n\nSheeran wouldn't reveal the name of his song because \"someone might steal it.\"\n\nDaniel Craig wanted to 'make history' with James Bond\n\n\"With Bond, I've had a theme tune written for about three years, just in case!\" - @EdSheeran on the #LateLate pic.twitter.com/MDA1GzVhmt \u2014 The Late Late Show (@RTELateLateShow) December 15, 2017\n\nCurrent Bond leading-mad Daniel Craig announced in August that he signed on to reprise his role for the fifth time (25th for the franchise as a whole). The upcoming flick doesn't yet have a director or title but is set to premier Nov. 8, 2019.\n\nHere's hoping that if Bond producers do get in touch with Sheeran's people that the collaboration is better received than Sheeran's \"Game of Thrones\" musical cameo.\n\nSign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!", "images":
