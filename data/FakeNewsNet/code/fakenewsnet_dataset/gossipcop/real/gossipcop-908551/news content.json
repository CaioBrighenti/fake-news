We\u2019ve done this movie and it was received in such an amazing, wonderful way, and we want to stay humble and grateful, and we\u2019re going to have another movie, so who knows? Maybe the next one!\u201d\n\nPreviously, EW spoke to Gadot at length for our Entertainers of the Year issue, and she walked us through her ups and downs of 2017 while ushering Wonder Woman to the big screen.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ouat-ts4-us.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1138984915-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bet.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1157866573.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ramy_105_bn_0972r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tracy-morgan_credit-paul-mobley.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/emmy-women.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tca.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1156593961.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2701px%2C1418.025px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/greys-anatomy-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-687357612.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/amazon.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/iasip_1310_9787r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/amy-pohler.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-56654121.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1149708303.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8507038badc1c41adb48fd6b51538fbd?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/awardist-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1156599506.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1150406283-1.jpg?crop=92px%2C121px%2C2608px%2C1369px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tout-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-687357612.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1157887505.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2311-136363.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/ww.jpg?crop=451px%2C99px%2C676px%2C677px&resize=150%2C150"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/gettyimages-687357612.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/oscars/2018/01/25/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-oscars/", "title": "Gal Gadot reacts to Wonder Woman Oscars snub", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot, Oscars", "news_keywords": "Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot, Oscars", "description": "As you might expect, Gal Gadot had a rather graceful response when asked by a reporter about Wonder Woman being shut out of the Oscars", "og": {"title": "Gal Gadot reacts to 'Wonder Woman' Oscars snub", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2018/01/25/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-oscars/", "description": "Gal Gadot is opening up about Wonder Woman being snubbed in the Oscar nominations.
