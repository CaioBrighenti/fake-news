He would smile at me and wave, and I would hurry past him, my blood running cold, my guts carrying the burden of what only he & I knew- that he expected me to shut my mouth and smile back.\u201d\n\nShe ended the post with a call to action. \u201cLadies, let\u2019s end this silence so the next generation of girls won\u2019t have to live with this bulls\u2014.\u201d\n\nAlyssa Milano sparked the movement after tweeting a note that read, \u201cSuggested by a friend: \u2018If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote \u201cme too\u201d as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.'\u201d\n\nNumerous women have come out in recent weeks with allegations of sexual harassment by Harvey Weinstein, although claims have not been limited to the mogul. Bj\u00f6rk recently shared that she was harassed while working on one of her two films, and Roy Price was recently put on leave from Amazon after Isa Hackett came forward with allegations against the executive.", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/america-ferrera-reuters.jpg",
