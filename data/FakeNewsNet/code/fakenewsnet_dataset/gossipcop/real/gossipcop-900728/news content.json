I LOVE U!!! SELFIE OR HUG?\"\n\nAs soon as he saw it, he invited Cruz to join him onstage. \"You beat cancer twice, I gotta give you at least a hug,\" he exclaimed. \"You must know, you beat cancer twice, you can do anything. In those dark times, you just remember to smile. Always smile!\"\n\nIn an adorable moment captured by fans on social media, HOVA wrapped his arms around Cruz for a sweet hug.
