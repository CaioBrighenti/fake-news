I grew up Catholic, and I went to Catholic school, so the story of Jesus and the crucifixion are very near and dear to my heart. I still go to Catholic Mass with my parents when I go home. The ritual and the familiarity and the comfort of our church community growing up is something I look back on really fondly now, even though I don\u2019t go to church any more.\n\nOn musicals It\u2019s this medium that exists somewhere between feet-on-the-ground and lifting off. It\u2019s sort of elevated reality, where you get to tell really beautiful stories, but everything is slightly surreal, and I really love what unlocks emotionally for people.\n\nOn Mary Magdalene She\u2019s actually a very powerful figure, and she is really motivated by her love for Jesus and his message. Historically, she was definitely a disciple and a believer and a champion of his message. She\u2019s got laser focus on her support of Jesus, in my interpretation, and that\u2019s how I\u2019m coming to it, with a pure sense of the ultimate kind of love for someone.\n\nOn \u2018Superstar\u2019 I rented the film \u2014 I was probably 12 or 13 and I was really into a lot of Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s musicals at the time, and I was listening to everything I could get my hands on. I remember just being really emotional about the music. What was so avant-garde and so revolutionary about Tim and Andrew\u2019s approach was that they really emphasized the humanity of these figures that have become so mythologized for us over the years. For someone who grew up in the church, as intimate as your relationship to Jesus can be, it\u2019s really interesting and nuanced to look at him as a human and to look at Mary as a human and Judas as a human.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30superstar3/30superstar3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30superstar1/merlin_136098780_28087ab7-d09b-4c56-aa4f-2ddc83b32094-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30superstar3/merlin_136098801_2f504f65-8277-44b8-bdb0-be4aab04507f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30superstar3/30superstar3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Paulson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/john-legend-and-the-jesus-christ-superstar-cast-on-faith-and-musicals.html", "title": "How John Legend, Sara Bareilles and Co-Stars See \u2018Jesus Christ Superstar\u2019 Roles", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-03-29T12:00:06.000Z", "modified": "2018-04-02T18:29:19.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/michael-paulson", "tag": "Lloyd Webber, Andrew"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005810002, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/b5e7fb34-aff0-58f3-85df-b199f8013803", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/0b12a4aab1cf4004acfe2743c0b5c1ac", "description": "Mr. Legend, Sara Bareilles, Alice Cooper and Brandon Victor Dixon, the lead actors in NBC\u2019s upcoming live performance of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d discuss the play, their faith and musical theater.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30superstar3/30superstar3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Michael Paulson", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30superstar3/30superstar3-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Theater,TV,Jesus Christ Superstar,John Legend,Sara Bareilles,Brandon Victor Dixon,Alice Cooper,Andrew Lloyd Webber", "pdate": 20180329, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/john-legend-and-the-jesus-christ-superstar-cast-on-faith-and-musicals.html", "type": "article", "title": "How John Legend, Sara Bareilles and Co-Stars See \u2018Jesus Christ Superstar\u2019 Roles", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30superstar3/30superstar3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "Mr. Legend, Sara Bareilles, Alice Cooper and Brandon Victor Dixon, the lead actors in NBC\u2019s upcoming live performance of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d discuss the play, their faith and musical theater."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/john-legend-and-the-jesus-christ-superstar-cast-on-faith-and-musicals.html", "title": "How John Legend, Sara Bareilles and Co-Stars See \u2018Jesus Christ Superstar\u2019 Roles", "description": "Mr. Legend, Sara Bareilles, Alice Cooper and Brandon Victor Dixon, the lead actors in NBC\u2019s upcoming live performance of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d discuss the play, their faith and musical theater.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30superstar3/30superstar3-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "A live concert version of &ldquo;Jesus Christ Superstar&rdquo; will air Sunday night on NBC."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005810002"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "arts", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/john-legend-and-the-jesus-christ-superstar-cast-on-faith-and-musicals.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005810002", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/john-legend-and-the-jesus-christ-superstar-cast-on-faith-and-musicals.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/john-legend-and-the-jesus-christ-superstar-cast-on-faith-and-musicals.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522296000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
