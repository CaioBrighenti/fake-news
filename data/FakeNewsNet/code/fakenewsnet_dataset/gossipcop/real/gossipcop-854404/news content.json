On Twitter, \"Aquaman\" director James Wan shared a new photo of Amber Heard's Mera, which shows the character in her full Atlantean outfit. The costume appears to be directly inspired by her look in the comics.\n\nThe photo shows Mera in a skin-tight green outfit plated with scales. At her waist, she wears her trademark Atlantean symbol, forged out of gold. She appears to have just emerged from the water, as her long red hair is wet and her sleeves are dripping.\n\nLady MERA swept in from the sea. First day with the exquisite Amber Heard.

In \"Justice League,\" she'll sport a more armored and dangerous look than the far less menacing one above.\n\nHaving first appeared in 1964\u2019s \u201cAquaman\u201d #11 published by DC Comics, and written and drawn by Jack Miller and Nick Cardy, respectively, the former queen of the mysterious Dimension Aqua (Xebel), and queen of Atlantis, also took up the mantle of a Red Lantern for the \u201cBlackest Night\u201d event series, and later became a member of Justice League United. \u201cAquaman\u201d director James Wan has stated the relationship between Mera and Aquaman will start out a little rough in the film.\n\nRELATED: Aquaman: Amber Heard Trains with Black Manta Actor in New Photo\n\nProduction on \u201cAquaman\u201d is already underway at Village Roadshow Studios in Queensland, Australia, most recently used for Disney\u2019s \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d and Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cThor: Ragnarok.\u201d Filming will also take place in Newfoundland, Sicily and Tunisia.\n\nArriving on December 21, 2018, \u201cAquaman\u201d stars Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Amber Heard as Mera, Patrick Wilson as Orm, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko and Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna.\n\nHasbro Reportedly Plans Power Rangers Movie Reboot, With New Cast", "images": ["https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/th-logo-full-white.7684e614.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/sr-logo-full-white.b0cc2b44.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-white.642d3d01.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/hc-logo-full-white.5f66cfe4.svg", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/91f52889f6a04390a65ad2591c59986e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tq-logo-full-white.7436bde3.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-white.04a6f0d4.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/ts-logo-full-white.54beb4cf.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tg-logo-full-white.fc9e742a.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/cb-logo-full-white.afca2e29.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-white.fe72c74c.svg", "https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aquaman-Mera-costume-feature.jpg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-white.8242bbb9.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tr-logo-full-white.090c581a.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1639279299697145&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aquaman-Mera-costume-feature.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Stone", "Brandon Staley", "Narayan Liu", "Meagan Damore"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbr.com/aquaman-mera-costume-photo/", "title": "Aquaman: New Photo Shows Mera's Costume Is Straight from the Comics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Aquaman director James Wan shared a new photo of Amber Heard's Mera, which shows the character in her full Atlantean outfit.", "og": {"title": "Aquaman: New Photo Shows Mera's Costume Is Straight from the Comics", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aquaman-Mera-costume-feature.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}, "url": "https://www.cbr.com/aquaman-mera-costume-photo/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Aquaman director James Wan shared a new photo of Amber Heard's Mera, which shows the character in her full Atlantean outfit.", "site_name": "CBR"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-18T16:05:11Z", "section": "Movies"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1754119328184357, "pages": 10765693196}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495123511.0, "source": "https://www.cbr.com", "summary": ""}
