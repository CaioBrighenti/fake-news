{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tiffany-Haddish", "text": "Tiffany Haddish, in full Tiffany Sarac Haddish, (born December 3, 1979, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), American comedian who was known for her unflinching candor and disarming authenticity. She shot to stardom with her no-holds-barred performance as Dina in the raunchy comedy Girls Trip (2017).\n\nHaddish\u2019s father, who was Eritrean, left the family when she was still a toddler. After her mother suffered brain damage in a car accident, Haddish spent several years in foster care before going to live with her grandmother as a teenager. Her penchant for making her classmates laugh led her social worker to point her toward the Laugh Factory Comedy Camp, a free summer program offered by the comedy club chain Laugh Factory to teach underprivileged children how to perform stand-up comedy. The camp proved to be a transformative experience for Haddish.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Haddish focused on forging a career in comedy, using her life as source material. Although she made headway, she earned so little money that at times she was forced to live in her car. Her first big break came in 2006 when she was a contestant on the television comedy competition show Who\u2019s Got Jokes? Two years later she appeared on Def Comedy Jam and the reality-show spoof Reality Bites Back. During this time, Haddish began to be cast in a number of sitcoms, and she also acted in such films as the comedies Meet the Spartans (2008) and The Janky Promoters (2009), which was written by and starred rapper and actor Ice Cube.\n\nHaddish gained a larger audience with recurring roles on the spoof comedy series Real Husbands of Hollywood (2013\u201314), starring Kevin Hart; Tyler Perry\u2019s If Loving You Is Wrong (2014\u201315); and The Carmichael Show (2015\u201317). She also became a sought-after guest for talk shows, appearing on Chelsea Lately, hosted by Chelsea Handler; The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; and The Arsenio Hall Show.\n\nGet unlimited access to all of Britannica\u2019s trusted content.

The following year she gave her breakout performance in Girls Trip, in which she costarred with (and stole the show from) Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, and Jada Pinkett Smith. In the wake of that success, Haddish starred in a TV comedy special, Tiffany Haddish: She Ready! From the Hood to Hollywood, became the first female African American comedian to host Saturday Night Live (SNL), and published a memoir, The Last Black Unicorn, all in 2017. For her work on SNL, she won an Emmy Award for outstanding guest actress in a comedy series. In 2018 Haddish began costarring with Tracy Morgan in the TV sitcom The Last O.G. Her movie roles that year included a teacher with unconventional methods in Night School, a long-suffering wife of an outspoken liberal in the holiday farce The Oath, and a recently paroled ex-convict who helps her straightlaced sister with her love life in Tyler Perry\u2019s Nobody\u2019s Fool. Haddish then appeared in the comedy special Kevin Hart\u2019s Guide to Black History and lent her voice to the animated feature The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part (both 2019).", "images": ["https://cdn.britannica.com/s:180x300,q:1/96/7796-004-67C1F2DE.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/marketing/newsletter-icon-white-SM.png", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:65x65,q:1/04/194504-117-6A31F64C.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/mendel/250-anniversary/thistle-gradient-half.png", "https://cdn.britannica.com/31/198731-004-F72994CE.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/marketing/GoH_Slider-revised.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:250x600,q:1/75/152975-004-7212D406.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:65x65,q:1/83/71383-117-D15B7519.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=154643575315468&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.britannica.com/mendel/250-anniversary/eb-mendel-anniversary-11-13-18-a2-resized.png", "https://cdn.britannica.com/marketing/GOH-300x90.gif", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:250x600,q:1/85/202285-004-82517C3C.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:180x300/14/198514-004-E7146601.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/marketing/header-subscribe.png", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:250x600,q:1/37/195437-004-72460684.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:180x300/28/79828-004-B39AFD52.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:65x65,q:1/91/195191-117-94569EAF.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:300x300,q:1/31/198731-004-F72994CE.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/marketing/bboy-print2.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:65x65,q:1/42/100242-117-3B30C720.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:180x300/09/09-004-29EC7FB9.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/s:180x300/37/157837-004-7FDE44F9.jpg", "https://cdn.britannica.com/marketing/extension-CHROME.png", "https://cdn.britannica.com/marketing/thistle-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.britannica.com/31/198731-004-F72994CE.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tiffany-Haddish", "title": "Tiffany Haddish | Biography, Career, & Facts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 74442380906, "app_id": 1887621861548296}, "description": "Tiffany Haddish: Tiffany Haddish, American comedian who shot to stardom with her no-holds-barred performance as Dina in the raunchy comedy Girls Trip (2017).
