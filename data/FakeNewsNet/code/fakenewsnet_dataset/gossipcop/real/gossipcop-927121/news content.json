A duet with McEntire and a beloved member of her family -- especially when said family member is Kelly Clarkson.\n\nFor an ACM Flashback performance at the 2018 Academy of Country Music Awards, McEntire, who doubled as the evening's host, took the stage with Clarkson to perform a stunning rendition of her 1993 smash.\n\n\"Does He Love You\" is the heartbroken tale of a woman scorned, but there's nothing scorned about the success of the track: It went on to take home a Grammy for Best Country Vocal Collaboration in 1994 and peaked atop Billboard's Country Airplay chart.\n\nClarkson and McEntire are super close, and McEntire told People how thrilled she was to reunite with her daughter-in-law on stage just before heading to Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena for the show.\n\n\"We have performed together many, many times,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to [tour together] anytime she wants to do that again, so getting back on stage with her is going to be a blast because she sings her butt off and she\u2019s cute as a button.\"\n\nShe did, indeed, sing her butt off -- and McEntire did, too.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/02-Kelly-Clarkson-and-Reba-McEntire-2018-acm-performance-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/02-Kelly-Clarkson-and-Reba-McEntire-2018-acm-performance-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Hughes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8338240/kelly-clarkson-reba-mcentire-2018-acm-awards-performance", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & Reba McEntire Soar On 'Does He Love You' ACM Awards Duet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & Reba McEntire's 2018 ACM Awards Performance: 'Does He Love You' Duet", "description": "What's better than Reba McEntire's \"Does He Love You\" sung by the fiery country queen herself?
