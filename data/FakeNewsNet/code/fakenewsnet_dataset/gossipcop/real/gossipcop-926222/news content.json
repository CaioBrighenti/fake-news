Faris, who appeared in the popular early 2000\u2019s \u201cScary Movie\u201d franchise and can currently be seen on the silver screen sleeper hit \u201cOverboard,\u201d a remake of the iconic 1980s comedy, purchased the property in late 2005 for $1.995 million and shared it with her first ex-husband, actor Ben Indra, before she shared it with her now second ex-husband, sit-com actor turned action flick star Chris Pratt. Tucked into a secluded cul-de-sac on two street-to-street parcels that together span nearly an acre of mostly hillside land, the single-story, 1950s ranch-style residence has three bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms in 2,563-square-feet.\n\nWith a chunky fireplace and lustrous, honey-toned hardwood floors that run throughout the house, the combination living and dining room opens through a wall of wood-trimmed floor-to-ceiling picture windows to a lagoon-style swimming pool and flagstone paved terrace surrounded by tropical plantings. Upgraded with up-to-date appliances and loads of storage, the kitchen includes a breakfast area with glass sliders to a small terrace perfect for a barbecue. Both guest bedrooms open to secluded patios as does the master suite that also offers a wall of closets and what marketing materials described as \u201can indulgent hotel spa-style bath\u201d with steam shower. A railroad tie staircase climbs the steep and planted hillside behind swimming pool and house to a picturesque, partly flag stone paved plateau with fire pit, Bocci ball court and through the trees canyon and city lights view.\n\nThe year after they made a baby in 2012, Faris and Pratt upgraded to a larger, approximately 4,300-square-foot Mediterranean residence almost directly across the street they scooped up in early 2013 for $3.3 million from Live Nation Entertainment president and CEO Michael Rapino.\n\nListing photos: Core Real Estate Group", "images":
