Here's where The Bachelorette's final three guys stand on the family and fantasy suite score boards heading into the finale.\n\n\n\nEric\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily: 8\n\n\n\nFantasy Suite: 8\n\nEric was a bag of surprises this week, as he managed to win over both Lindsay and her family. Despite the fact that he's never been in love, Eric's meeting with Rachel's family went shockingly well -- getting rave reviews from her sister for his honesty, and winning over her mother's approval (to the surprise of literally no one, honorable Judge Lindsay couldn't make it).\n\nIt seems the family's stamp of approval (and a hot tub session?) was all Eric needed to truly let himself go, as he revealed to Rachel during their date in Spain that he was finally in love. Ten years later, because Eric read the date card like he was suffering from spelling bee PTSD, the two headed off to the fantasy suite, where things obviously went well enough for Eric to tell Rachel he loved her 13 times as he walked her to her car the next morning.\n\n\"Once again, I spend time with Eric, and it takes our relationship to another level,\" Rachel gushed. True.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Rachel Lindsay Says She Doesn't Want Anyone From Her Season to Be the Next Bachelor\n\n\n\nBryan\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily: 5\n\n\n\nFantasy Suite: 0\n\nTo be fair, Bryan's 0 in Fantasy Suites is only because the episode ended before his date aired (thanks, Peter!) -- but his time with Rachel's family didn't exactly go well. He came on super strong, which only made her family question his feelings even more.\n\nRachel, however, wouldn't stand for her family's criticisms, and defended Bryan against their \"unnecessary\" questions. After Rachel had heart-to-heart with her mom, Bryan seemed to\n\nfinally catch a break, getting her mom's blessing to \"build on\" their relationship. Not exactly Rachel's hand in marriage, but we think it's probably the best he could've hoped for.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelorette' Castoff Dean Unglert Says Rachel Lindsay Is 'Blinded' By Frontrunner Bryan\n\nPeter\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily: 10\n\n\n\nFantasy Suite: 2\n\nRachel's family loved Peter so much that they declared him the \"winner\" -- but those good vibes didn't translate to his date in Spain. Peter finally revealed that he was falling in love with Rachel before meeting the parents, but in Spain, he said that he's still not ready for a proposal.\n\nThis didn't sit well with Rachel. The two forgot all about their cute winery date as they engaged in an argument about their possible engagement. In Rachel's eyes, engagement is the promise to get married down the line, but Peter said he's not getting down on one knee until he's ready to plan the wedding.\n\n\"I didn't come this far and put my life on hold and sacrifice everything to do this to just have a boyfriend at the end of it. That's not what I want, because I could have done it without all this,\" Rachel explained, before things got teary.\n\n\"For the first time ever, I'm thinking Peter and I may not work out,\" she confessed after their fight, while in the promo for next week's episode, Peter asked, \"What's wrong with me?\"\n\nTo be continued...\n\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Bachelorette' Rachel Lindsay Reveals Which Suitor She Plans to Confront at 'Men Tell All'\n\nRachel told ET that she didn't get intimate with everybody in the fantasy suites.
