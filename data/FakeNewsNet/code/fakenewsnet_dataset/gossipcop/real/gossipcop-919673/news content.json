See her, dare we say equally as gorgeous, copy-cat pic!\n\nIf imitation is the highest form of flattery, Beyonce, 36, should be VERY proud! After all, Real Housewives of Orange County star, Meghan King Edmonds, 33, completely copied the singer\u2019s internet-breaking pregnancy announcement pic from 2017\u2026and she kind of nailed it! While we\u2019ve seen a few spoofs since Bey\u2019s original hit Instagram last year, Meghan\u2019s is definitely our favorite \u2014 her attention to detail is impeccable! The best part? Meghan is ALSO expecting twins in June \u2014 just like Beyonce was!\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t be Queen Bey I\u2019ll settle for King Edmonds,\u201d Meghan captioned her series of hilarious imitation photos. She followed that up with the captions, \u201c#twinscomingsoon #imitationisflattery #thisIsNotMyMaternityShoot.\u201d The reality star posted the impressive pics via Instagram on March 9, and in them she\u2019s wearing a mis-matched bra and panty set that\u2019s nearly identical to Beyonce\u2019s. She also shared a behind-the-scenes video of her and her team prepping for the shoot.

That made me laugh out loud for real. Go @meghankedmonds Yaaasss, girl!\u201d one person wrote. Another gushed, \u201cI like yours more @meghankedmonds \u2764\ufe0f.\u201d But of course the Beyhive couldn\u2019t help weighing in as well, and they were less than impressed. \u201cOh sweetie, you are NOT Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d one Insta-user said. While another simply wrote, \u201cHow dare you.\u201d Come on guys, it\u2019s HILARIOUS! If you\u2019re going to copy such an Insta-famous pic, you\u2019ve got to do it right \u2014 and let\u2019s be real, Meghan did it right!\n\nMeghan is currently expecting babies number two and three with husband Jim Edmonds, 47. The two are already proud parents of 1-year-old daughter Aspen King Edmonds, and they announced this latest pregnancy in late November after undergoing IVF. Two months later she revealed it was twins! \u201cWe\u2019re having TWINS! Oh boy oh boy! \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99#doubletrouble #threeundertwo,\u201d the expectant mom captioned the reveal. In her photo she, Jim, and Aspen have signs that read, \u201cOur family is growing by four feet and two heartbeats\u201d and \u201cEdmonds twin boys June 2018.\u201d", "images": ["https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger-things-potw.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://qr00rq.com/lxkomj?MXwXWgoNHkgPV18dS04CG0tdFlIlBjxXHRlBQR4dVhcDTFoOGQgEQVVCEUkZCB1LXRYeAQUYWREbFVQLGFYXA0xJXhI", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/megan_beyonce-ftr.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/porsha-williams-shows-off-baby-boss-pilar-ftr.png?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cereals.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tobey-maguire-as-spider-man-in-spider-man-2-66-960x639-115424-1280x0.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WHEN_I_GET_HOME.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F03%2F09%2Fmeghan-king-edmonds-beyonce-pregnancy-pics-copies-baby-bump-photo-shoot%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3029775", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/serena-williams-lose-wimbledon-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/megan_beyonce-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/cardi-b-fashion-2019.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/north-west-and-penelope-disick-cutest-moments-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/megan_beyonce-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/09/meghan-king-edmonds-beyonce-pregnancy-pics-copies-baby-bump-photo-shoot/", "title": "Meghan King Edmonds Copies Beyonce\u2019s Iconic Pregnancy Photo Shoot: Who Did It Best?", "meta_data": {"description": "Totally spoofing Beyonce's epic pregnancy pic, Meghan Edmonds, who's also expecting twins, made a bold statement!
