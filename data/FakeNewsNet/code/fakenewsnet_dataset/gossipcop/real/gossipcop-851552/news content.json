{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/dakota-johnson-hair", "text": "Not to make this all about me, but as a person with very curly hair, I'm rarely impacted by celebrity hairstyles. Instead, all the lobs and inventive looks just reinforce what I know to be true: I'll have long layers until I die. So my threshold for celebrity hair obsessions is pretty high. There's Nicole Kidman's curls in Moulin Rouge, Julia Roberts' ringlets in Mystic Pizza, and now Dakota Johnson's phenomenal hair. There's no self-interest in it because I can't relate to her texture, which is how I know my love is true.\n\nThe adoration is a recent thing. Johnson keeps a low profile outside of the Shades of Grey trilogy, I can only assume because the series is such a moneymaker that she can pick her projects carefully. But 2018 is bringing us more Dakota than ever. With Bad Times at the El Royale premiering this week and Suspiria hitting theaters a few days before Halloween, she's just started hitting the press circuit to promote the two, bringing her incredible hair along for the ride.\n\nHer bangs are the MVP. Most often center-parted, they're curtain bangs to the prettiest degree, with a hint of straight-across fringe depending on how they lie. The layering is magnificent. Her hair gradually falls into a cool, seventies-like shag (Suspiria is set in the decade, so that makes sense). The versatility is the best part: whether her hair is pulled half-back, up in a pony, or down and flowing, her face-framing layers manage to skirt the look of prom-y tendrils. Even within a single night's look, from one angle they look like Audrey Hepburn\u2013esque baby bangs and from another like sexy rocker bangs falling into her eyes.\n\nIt's like a magic trick. Barely there bangs from one angle:\n\nActress Dakota Johnson arrives for the premiere of the film \"Suspiria\" presented in competition on September 1, 2018 during the 75th Venice Film Festival at Venice Lido.
