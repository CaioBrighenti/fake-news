And while they were there, they shared yet another trailer with the audience, and this one showed a bit more of Gerard \u2014 who\u2019s building an army to kill all the werewolves \u2014 gave fans a few more glimpses at a Scott-Malia romance, and showed just how powerful fear can be.\n\nBut Scott and his pack aren\u2019t backing down from who/whatever this new villain is, and from the looks of it, it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nIn addition to the trailer, cast members Tyler Posey, Shelley Hennig, Khylin Rhambo, Dylan Sprayberry, Cody Christian, Charlie Carver, and surprise guest Dylan O\u2019Brien joined showrunner Jeff Davis for a panel moderated by fellow cast members Linden Ashby and Melissa Ponzio.\n\nThe panel kicked off with a video message from Tyler Hoechlin and Ian Bohen, who introduced a clip of Derek Hale\u2019s big return. (Spoiler: Gerard is back to hunting, and, for some reason, he wants Derek.)\n\nThe cast then boarded the stage to talk about six years of life in Beacon Hills. Within minutes, both Posey and O\u2019Brien got emotional when discussing their journeys on the show. \u201cThey make me happier and they save my life,\u201d Posey said of his Teen Wolf family. O\u2019Brien added: \u201cIt\u2019s just been a family, and it will always be a family. I\u2019ll always miss this character and this show.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nWhen asked when they knew the show was something special, Posey talked about meeting O\u2019Brien and realizing they had so much in common. \u201cI never had too many buddies growing up as an actor that were in the industry,\u201d Posey recalled. Speaking both to O\u2019Brien and the show as a whole, Posey continued, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just work, it was friendship and finding my purpose in life and becoming an adult and making a difference.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien mirrored Posey\u2019s sentiments: \u201cFor me, it was never a job,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, claiming Teen Wolf became his \u201chome\u201d over the years. Commenting on the fact that he continued to return to the show even as he took on new projects, O\u2019Brien said, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wait to come home.\u201d\n\nHow do we evolve and change?
