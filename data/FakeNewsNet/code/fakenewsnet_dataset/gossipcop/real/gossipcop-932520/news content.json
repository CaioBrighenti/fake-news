But fear not, Rebecca Pearson fans: the wedding might just happen anytime now.\n\n\"I think we have a general ballpark idea of when we want it to happen, but I think because it's not going to be some lavish affair, it's maybe something that isn't going to require as much planning, or at least that's what I'm telling myself,\" she told Sibley Scoles in an interview on E! News . \"I picked a funny profession for someone who doesn't like all the attention focused on them, so I've already done my girls weekend.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old also dished about the engagement party she had last September. \"It was sort of a birthday/bachelorette girls weekend all rolled into one and that was fabulous and fantastic so now I sort of feel like it could happen at a moment's notice. Maybe I won't even tell people and they'll just show up at the house and it will just unfold.\"\n\nSee more: Mandy Moore Says She Didn't Want an Engagement Ring Until She Saw the One Fianc\u00e9 Taylor Goldsmith Picked Out\n\nThe star has been hinting at wedding plans since news of her engagement broke, giving fans a little taste of whats to come for the big day.

I've never been the girl that wanted to wear a white dress. No judgement, but it's not for me. I think it'll be just as small with family and friends. Quit, no bridal magazines for me.\" (Hopefully she changes her mind for us!)\n\nThe bride has not yet confirmed a wedding date, but it sounds like she's just going with the flow.
