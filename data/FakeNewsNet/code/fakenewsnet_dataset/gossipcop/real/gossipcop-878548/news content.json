The pop star just launched her first makeup line, Fenty Beauty, her song with DJ Khaled, \"Wild Thoughts,\" is rocking the Billboard charts, and she's still hanging out with that Saudi billionaire she was first spotted kissing over the summer. (RiRi tried to hide him under an umbrella-ella last month, but the Internet wasn't fooled!) All of Rihanna's body-shamers need to sit down, because she's on top of the world.\n\nBut even though Rihanna is ubiquitous, there's still a lot we don't know about her\u2014as this new interview with Elle proves. The singer covers several topics during her recent chat with the magazine\u2014including why lipstick is her \"secret weapon\"\u2014but the most interesting tidbit involves time travel.\n\nOne of Rihanna's friends, magician David Copperfield, asked her where she'd go if she was magically zapped anywhere in the world, and her answer was pretty surprising.\n\n\"Ten minutes before I lost my virginity,\" Rihanna told Copperfield, who said that he actually can make her disappear and reappear any place on Earth. (Not sure if he was kidding or not.)\n\nInteresting, right? There was no follow-up to this question. Rihanna didn't explain why she'd transport back to the day she lost her virginity or when exactly this was. It's a curious thought, though. Losing your virginity is typically a very awkward and vulnerable experience. I certainly wouldn't want to repeat that day\u2014it seems like Rihanna might want to prevent it from happening altogether.\n\nLeave it to Rihanna to give the most mysterious and intriguing answer to this question. Most people would've just said the Bahamas. OK, I would've said the Bahamas.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nRihanna's Fenty Beauty Is Here and It's Even Better Than We Dreamed\n\nRihanna Hides Her Rumored Boyfriend\u2014Where Else?\u2014Under Her Umbrella\n\nRihanna Just Shut Down Her Body-Shamers in the Greatest Way", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59b2d0bef98e005f9c2c7cf1/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/RIHANNA.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d0cdd671078a2397469b56b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/rihanna-seth-meyers.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59b2d0bef98e005f9c2c7cf1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/RIHANNA.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1503581985/glamour_maddie-ziegler-gives-little-girls-advice-on-beauty-friendship-confidence.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1cb520e0bbf400099392cc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/SH18048%2520MKS%252015C%2520IV%2520RGB-1280x1280.jpeg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d028951f16a7f6dcfc3b1ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/RIHANNA-MEGHAN-MARKLE.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59b2d0bef98e005f9c2c7cf1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/RIHANNA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Julyssa Lopez", "Bella Cacciatore", "Christopher Ros", "Anna Moeslein"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/rihanna-wants-to-time-travel-back-to-the-day-she-lost-her-virginity", "title": "Rihanna Wants to Time-Travel Back to the Day She Lost Her Virginity", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "In a new interview with Elle magazine, Rihanna reveals she wants to time-travel back to the day she lost her virginity.
