As Prince William\u2019s brother Prince Harry is expecting his first child with Meghan Markle, bookies have slashed the odds on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expecting a baby as well. Bookies Coral have released odds over a sudden announcement from the future King and Queen of England as the odds now shows the chance of Kate being pregnant at 1/2 - a 50 percent chance.\n\nCoral's Harry Aitkenhead said: \"Our odds show that there's every chance that Kate and Wills might add to their growing family, and a fourth baby is certainly a possibility.\n\n\u201cWe've taken some bets over the last two weeks or so on it happening and there's a real buzz around the Royal family at the moment with Meghan expecting.\u201d\n\nBut whether the Duchess of Cambridge will follow in the Queen\u2019s footstep by having four children is yet to be confirmed.\n\nOne source has said he does not think Kate will have more children as he thinks \u201cKate is done\u201d after suffering extreme morning sickness throughout her three previous pregnancies.", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/12/285x190/1046116_1.jpg", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/285x190/1043190_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/285x190/1046218_1.jpg", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/285x190/1031829_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1046244.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2019-07-06.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1046244.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amalie Henden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1046244/Kate-Middleton-pregnant-Is-Kate-Middleton-pregnant-with-fourth-baby-Kate-pregnant-odds", "title": "Kate Middleton pregnant?
