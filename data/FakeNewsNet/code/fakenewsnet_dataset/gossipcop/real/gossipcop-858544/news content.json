We had a feeling Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner would take issue with Caitlyn\u2019s explosive new memoir \u2014 in which she bashes the Kardashians \u2014 but we had no idea Kendall would team up with them by slamming her own father. Watch the new video here!\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\u2018s explosive new memoir, The Secrets of My Life, becomes a topic of conversation during the June 4 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. And in this new sneak peek at Sunday\u2019s episode, we see a very unhappy Kendall Jenner talking to her mom, Kris, about it after learning from Kim what was written in the book.\n\n\u201cI heard about all the stuff that [Caitlyn] was saying in it and just how a lot of it\u2019s so not true,\u201d Kendall tells Kris in this new clip. \u201cThe weird part is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s purposeful lying. I think she really just thinks that\u2019s what happened for some weird reason.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could have been handled in the most amazing, loving way,\u201d Kris replies. \u201cTalk about your journey and keep it to that\u2014that I would have had great respect for. Don\u2019t talk about, in a real negative way, everything was like I am such a bad person\u201d \u2026 \u201cThere\u2019s lies that are printed in a book that lives there for the end of time. So, your children are going to read this book about their grandparent and have a story that\u2019s fabricated. That\u2019s in print and is a fabrication.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d Kendall says before adding, \u201cAnd then she goes around dissing the Kardashians, but it\u2019s like, those are the kids that you raised! If you have a problem with them, you raised them! That makes no sense to me that she would go around bashing us for no reason. It\u2019s insane, mom! That\u2019s insane!\u201d\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on E!
