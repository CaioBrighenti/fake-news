The ceremony is set to be broadcast live Sept. 17 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS, home of \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\nBy tapping Colbert as host, CBS follows the example of competitors ABC and NBC, who in recent years have turned to their own late-night stars for the Emmys gig. Jimmy Kimmel hosted the Emmys last year and in 2012 on ABC. Seth Meyers hosted in 2014 and Jimmy Fallon in 2010 for NBC.\n\nThe Emmys will be the first major awards-show gig for Colbert, who took over CBS\u2019 \u201cLate Show\u201d in 2015 following the retirement of founding host David Letterman. Last year, the network\u2019s other late-night star, James Corden, hosted the Tony Awards, and Variety reported exclusively in November that Corden would host the Grammy Awards later this year. CBS holds exclusive broadcast rights to both shows. The Emmys rotate among ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to kick off the new season and celebrate the top achievements in television with Stephen Colbert as host of the Primetime Emmys,\u201d said Jack Sussman, executive vice president, specials, music and live events, CBS Entertainment. \u201cStephen is the ultimate master of ceremonies with award-winning creative talents, and as we\u2019ve seen the past few months, he has a fearless passion for live television. We look forward to honoring television\u2019s best while entertaining audiences with the creative energy and sharp comedy of Stephen Colbert.\u201d\n\nTelevision Academy chairman and CEO Hayma Washington added, \u201cWe are thrilled that Stephen Colbert will be bringing his Emmy-winning comedic talent to hosting this year\u2019s Emmy Awards. He\u2019s a formidable showman and we are delighted to begin working with him and the entire CBS team.\u201d\n\nColbert\u2019s previous show, \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d won nine Emmys for its nine-year run on Comedy Central \u2014 seven for outstanding writing in a variety series, and two for outstanding variety series.\n\nThe 2016 Emmys with Kimmel drew positive reviews and helped propel Kimmel to a gig hosting this year\u2019s Academy Awards. But facing competition from \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d on NBC, the awards-show drew a record-low 11.3 million viewers and 2.8 ratings among adults 18-49, according to Nielsen live-plus-same day numbers.\n\n\u201cThis will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period,\u201d said Stephen Colbert. \u201cBoth in person and around the globe.\u201d\n\nNominations for the 2017 Primetime Emmys will be announced July 13.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/game-of-thrones-siggraph.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dietpills_featured.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hbo-chernobyl.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10331334cg-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/chloe-dan-2nd-photo.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/9245539a-cropped-e1562834428290.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/schitts-creek-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/daniel-holloway-variety_new.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/simona-halep-5-things-to-know-ftr-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nicholsfabian.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/oscar-jaenada-shooting-hernan.jpg?crop=0px%2C283px%2C5472px%2C3084px&resize=450%2C253", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger-things.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/st3.jpeg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/marc-guggenheim.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jakeg.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fawards%2Fcolbert-host-2017-emmy-awards-1201966986%2F&ct=article&lob=pmc-core&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1201966986&comment_count=9", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-lion-king.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-episode-6.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2037-_toy-story-4_-cast-explains-why-forky-isne28099t-named-sporky-youtube-f09f948a.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jacob-and-zach.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rexfeatures_10314204hj-e1561059816154.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/game-of-thrones-siggraph.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lion-king.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/youngdylan.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/premiazioni_10.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/big-little-lies-season-2-2.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spiderman-far-from-home.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-13-at-8.41.51-AM.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/theylive1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Holloway", "Executive Editor", "Https", "Twitter.Com Gdanielholloway", "Daniel'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/awards/colbert-host-2017-emmy-awards-1201966986/", "title": "Stephen Colbert to Host 2017 Emmy Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Stephen Colbert will host the the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards.
