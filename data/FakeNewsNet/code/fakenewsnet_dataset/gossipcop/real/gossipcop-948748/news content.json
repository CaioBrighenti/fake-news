But there was a lot more to that gorgeous frock than what meets the eye.\n\nOver the weekend, The Big Bang Theory actress and her now-husband, professional equestrian Karl Cook, tied the knot in a romantic barn wedding in San Diego, surrounded by family, friends, and of course, plenty of horses. But it wasn't the stunning rustic decor or the horse-filled stable that caught everyone's attention\u2014it was the bride's gorgeous wedding gown that really stole the day.\n\nCuoco walked down the aisle in a custom made Reem Acra wedding gown, which according to E! News took over 400 hours to construct. The dress featured a sweetheart neckline and was covered in embroidered flowers from top to bottom. It also included a stunning cape, which featured the same embroidered flower pattern. The entire look was styled by Brad Goreski and Daniela Romero.\n\n\"It was a joy to create this custom gown for Kaley. She looked wonderful and I wish her and Karl a lifetime of happiness,\" Reem Acra told E! News in a statement.\n\nFollowing the ceremony, the actress, 32, changed into a Tadashi Shoji lace jumpsuit to party the night away.\n\nWhile the bride may have gone all out on her dress, she kept the rest of her look pretty simple. According to People , the actress used only $46 worth of drugstore beauty products to get her wedding day look. Makeup artist Jamie Greenberg revealed the exact products she used on Cuoco to give her that blushing bride look, and they're all totally affordable.\n\nSee more: Kaley Cuoco Shows Off Her Bride Status in Fun T-Shirt\n\nGreenberg prepped the skin with Skyn Iceland Hydro Cool Firming Eye Gels that have appeared in many a pre-red carpet selfie.
