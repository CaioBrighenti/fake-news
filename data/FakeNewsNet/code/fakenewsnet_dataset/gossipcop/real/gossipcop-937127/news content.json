It has been a traditional venue for royal weddings since the future King Edward VII married Princess Alexandra of Denmark in 1863.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The pair, who met through a mutual friend, announced their engagement on Monday.\n\nA statement from Clarence House said: \u201cHis Royal Highness and Ms Markle became engaged in London earlier this month. Prince Harry has informed Her Majesty The Queen and other close members of his family. Prince Harry has also sought and received the blessing of Ms Markle's parents\".\n\nDuring a TV appearance on Monday night, Prince Harry revealed he proposed to Markle in the kitchen over a roast kitchen while they enjoyed a \"standard, typical night\" in their cottage.\n\n\u201cIt was so sweet and natural and very romantic,\u201d Markle told BBC.\n\nShe added: \u201cAs a matter of fact, I could barely let you finish proposing. I said, \u2018Can I say yes now\u2019?\u201d\n\nAfter their relationship became public just over a year ago, Prince Harry lashed out at the paparazzi for subjecting Markle to a \u201cwave of abuse and harassment\u201d.\n\nIn an unusual public statement, the Palace attacked the \u201cracial undertones\u201d of media coverage of Markle and said the prince feared for her safety. The actor, whose father is white and mother is African American, has described herself as biracial and \u201chalf black and half white\u201d on her website.\n\n\u201cMy dad is Caucasian and my mom is African-American. To say who I am, to share where I\u2019m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman,\" Markle has previously said.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/28/11/harry-meghan-engagement-1.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/28/11/harry-meghan-engagement-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samuel Osborne", "Maya Oppenheim"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-royal-family-paid-st-georges-chapel-windsor-castle-a8080381.html", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding will be paid for by royal family", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-royal-family-paid-st-georges-chapel-windsor-castle-a8080381.html", "title": "The royal family will pay for Prince Harry and Meghan's wedding", "description": "They newly engaged couple are will marry in May at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle", "updated_time": "2017-11-28T16:32:13+00:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/28/11/harry-meghan-engagement-1.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/8080381"}, "description": "The royal family will pay for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, Kensington Palace has announced.
