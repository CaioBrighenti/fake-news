In a new interview, with 53-year-old actress revealed her brood has been asked \"a couple times\" to star on their own reality series but Lori has said her home life is \"not that exciting!\"\n\nWhen recently asked on E!'s Daily Pop if she, her hubby of more than 20 years, Mossimo Giannulli, and their two teenage daughters have wanted to enter the reality television world, Lori replied, \"No\u2026 we've been asked to do a reality show a couple times\u2026 we're not that exciting.\"\n\nBella, Lori, and Olivia.\n\nThe Fuller House star continued, \"I have my two girls, they're 18 and 19 and they're doing really well. Olivia Jade's YouTube channel is doing really well and Bella's at her first year of college and she's enjoying it and she's also pursuing an acting career.\" Though Lori's daughters are now becoming famous themselves \u2014 Olivia Jade's YouTube channel has 1.3 million subscribers and Bella starred in the 2016 Hallmark movie Every Christmas Has a Story with her mom \u2014 the girls have admitted they \"sometimes forget\" about their mama's celebrity status.\n\n\"I sometimes forget that she's famous. It's odd to see her on the TV screen and then turn around and see her cooking dinner,\" Bella told Teen Vogue in a previous interview. Olivia similarly added, \"I don't think I even realized the success of the show until I clicked on the Netflix Fuller House promo recently and noticed it had more than 13 million views.\"\n\nLori and her husband, Mossimo.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years in showbiz, Lori's acting career is even busier than ever today \u2014 and she's luckily able to balance her work and family life with the help of her fashion designer hubby, Mossimo. \"It's challenging and you go day by day. I\u2019m very lucky that when I\u2019m working, my husband, [the girls' dad], is around and he's with them. So they're \u2014 they always have a parent with them 24/7. And we tag team very well, my husband and I,\" she said in a past interview.", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Miami-Vice-e1562948475581.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pink-daughter-willow.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin-husband.jpg?w=1180#038;h=1000&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-13-at-10.37.44-AM-e1563028777937.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin-daughters.jpg?w=1180#038;h=500&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/donny-osmond-debbie-osmond-grandkids.jpg?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Birkinbine", "Feb"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/lori-loughlin-family-reality-show-154572/", "title": "Lori Loughlin's Family Isn't Interested in Starring on a Reality TV Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "If you've been hoping that Lori Loughlin, her husband, and two daughters might pop up on a reality TV show, you'll be sad to hear this!
