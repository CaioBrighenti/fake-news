But the most popular, the \"standard plan,\" which allows HD and two simultaneous streams, will increase to $10.99 a month from $9.99.\n\nThe highest-tier plan, which supports features like 4K video resolution and four simultaneous streams, will increase to $13.99 a month from $11.99.\n\nMashable first reported the price increase.\n\nNew subscribers will see the price increase go into effect on Thursday. Current subscribers will start being notified on October 19, and it will take effect in their next billing cycle.\n\nNetflix's price increases always spark drama.\n\nIn October 2015, Netflix raised its prices for new members and then embarked on a process of \"un-grandfathering\" existing customers into new prices. When the bulk of that process happened last year, media and public chatter rose to such a degree that Netflix blamed it for a missed quarter of subscriber growth.\n\n\"People don't like price increases \u2014 we know that,\" CEO Reed Hastings said on an earnings call last year.\n\nPeople may not like them, but price increases will most likely continue to be necessary as Netflix spends more and more on content \u2014 close to $7 billion next year, according to its content boss, Ted Sarandos. Funding its original productions is not cheap, and Netflix has made big moves recently, like poaching the TV power player Shonda Rhimes from ABC and buying the comic-book publisher Millarworld.\n\nStill, despite the price increase, Netflix will remain a much better deal than cable in terms of viewing time.\n\nIn a report this summer, UBS analysts found that an average pay-TV package cost over three times as much per hour of viewing as Netflix. The per-hour cost of traditional packages was about $0.42, while that of Netflix was about $0.10.\n\nThat lead is not likely to be hurt too much by a $1 or $2 price increase.\n\nHere's a chart from UBS that shows how Netflix prices have fared relative to cable prices over time:", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/57c03d1eb996eb5d128b4973-2732-1366.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/57c03d0fb996eb93008b4a20-750-563.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/57c03d1eb996eb5d128b4973-2732-1366.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nathan Mcalone"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-raising-prices-october-2017-10", "title": "Netflix is raising its prices starting this month", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-10-05", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-05", "news_keywords": "Netflix, Price hike, Nathan McAlone", "sailthru.tags": "Netflix, Price hike, Nathan McAlone", "description": "Netflix will raise prices for its US subscribers starting October 5.", "sailthru.description": "Netflix will raise prices for its US subscribers starting October 5.", "title": "Netflix is raising its prices starting this month", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire, sai, moneygame", "sailthru.title": "Netflix is raising its prices starting this month", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/57c03d1eb996eb5d128b4973-2732-1366.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d63527351ccf0b158b8309-2560-1920.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d63527351ccf0b158b8309-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "sailthru.author": "Nathan McAlone", "og": {"title": "Netflix is raising its prices starting this month", "description": "Netflix will raise prices for its US subscribers starting October 5.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-raising-prices-october-2017-10", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/57c03d1eb996eb5d128b4973-2732-1366.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Nathan McAlone", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-raising-prices-october-2017-10", "title": "Netflix is raising its prices starting this month", "description": "Netflix will raise prices for its US subscribers starting October 5.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/57c03d1eb996eb5d128b4973-2732-1366.jpg", "creator": "@nmcalone", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "Netflix is raising its prices starting this month": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507176000.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
