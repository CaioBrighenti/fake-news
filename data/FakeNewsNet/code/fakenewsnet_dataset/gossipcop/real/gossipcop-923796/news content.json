Your positivity and inspiration is something we could all use a little more of these days.\n\n\n\nHonored to write for you, prouder to be your friend. #ThisIsMe pic.twitter.com/tG7wcZK7et \u2014 Dan Fogelman (@Dan_Fogelman) March 27, 2018\n\n\u201cI am not perfect and I am not screaming that from the mountain tops at all.

I have to get used to being comfortable with being uncomfortable,\" the NBC star revealed.\n\nAnother way the actress is learning to love herself is by accepting her struggle with food and realizing there will be good days and bad days. It is no secret Metz has battled her weight her whole life, which was a basis of her stepfather\u2019s abuse.\n\n\u201cI definitely have great days and I have days that are I am like, 'Oh! Womp, womp' but I think that's when I get in my own head and I get in my own way,\" said Metz.\n\nChrissy Metz talks about self-love in her new memoir.
