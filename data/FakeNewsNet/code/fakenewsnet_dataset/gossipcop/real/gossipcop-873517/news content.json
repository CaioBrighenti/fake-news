This is the message that speaks louder than words. Swift went away with winning her $1 but there\u2019s more to it than that. This is a new chapter for Swift and for every person she fought for in the courtroom.\n\nWho knows what might come after this. Maybe it\u2019s new music (we hope!) or maybe it gives Swift a greater and more personal reason to give back. Whatever this chapter may hold for Swift, we are thankful that we were able to be a part of watching such a victorious and inspiring moment.\n\nAfter dealing with this situation for four years now, we all can move on and look forward to the future. We are out of the woods because justice was served in a powerful way. Now, we can sit back, relax, and watch life \u201cBegin Again\u201d.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://fansoftaylor.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/362/files/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-15-at-9.37.54-AM.jpg&c=sc&w=582&h=575", "https://fansoftaylor.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/apple-app.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035728&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/fansoftaylor/logo_fansoftaylor-com__150x150.png&w=150&h=150", "https://fansoftaylor.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/android-app.png", "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/image?url=https://cdn.fansided.com/logos/entertainment/taylorswift.png&c=sc&w=75&h=75", "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffansoftaylor.com%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2FScreen-Shot-2017-08-15-at-9.38.27-AM.jpg&w=850&h=560&c=sc", "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/fansided-logo.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1578981752316085&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://fansoftaylor.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/362/files/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-15-at-9.38.27-AM.jpg&c=sc&w=825&h=528", "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://fansoftaylor.com/files/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-15-at-9.38.27-AM.jpg&"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/fan/image?url=https://fansoftaylor.com/files/2017/08/Screen-Shot-2017-08-15-at-9.38.27-AM.jpg&", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Cronin", "Kara Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://fansoftaylor.com/2017/08/15/the-final-post-it-note-during-taylor-swifts-trial-speaks-louder-than-words/", "title": "The Final Post-It Note Message During Taylor Swift\u2019s Trial Speaks Louder Than Words", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Employees of Craftsy working in the office last week began putting up post-it not messages in support of Taylor Swift during her sexual assault trial.", "DC.date.issued": "2017-08-15T09:49:52-04:00", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.10", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@fansoftaylorFS", "title": "The Final Post-It Note Message During Taylor Swift\u2019s Trial Speaks Louder Than Words", "description": "The final post-it note during Taylor Swift's trial simply says it all.
