The trio will also be joined by a group of suicide attempt and loss survivors selected by the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.\n\nThe Lifeline\u2019s hotline number is actually the inspiration for Cara, Khalid and Logic\u2019s suicide prevention anthem\u201c1-800-273-8255.\u201d Cara, Khalid and Logic previously performed the song at the MTV VMAs alongside suicide survivors last summer. After the group took the stage with the powerful performance, the Lifeline said call volume to their hotline increased 50 percent, according to a statement from MTV.\n\nImage zoom C Flanigan/Getty
