The Old Man & the Gun\n\nYear: 2018\n\nDirector: David Lowery\n\nOf the many things that David Lowery\u2019s The Old Man & the Gun does right, staying fixated on Redford\u2019s face is the smartest. Redford, in what he has said is his last performance (though he\u2019s since backtracked from that), plays Forrest Tucker, who, we learn at a calm, leisurely pace, is a lifelong bank robber. And I really mean lifelong: He\u2019s still at it in his eighties in the year 1981, with a small, equally elderly crew (played by Danny Glover and Tom Waits!), hitting banks across the Southwest with precision, intelligence and, more than anything else, a disarming politeness. (All his victims keep remarking how friendly he is.) Meanwhile, a Texas cop (Casey Affleck), dissatisfied with his career, trails him and becomes part of a cat-and-mouse game, with Tucker leaving him playful notes and even, in one terrific scene, popping in on him in the bathroom. The lifelong rogue, who has spent most of his life being sentenced to prison and then busting out, also comes across a widow named Jewel (Sissy Spacek), and they have a gentle, wistful courtship. He clearly cares for her \u2026 but he\u2019s a bank robber, and he\u2019s never going to stop. Lowery pushes the story on with a style that\u2019s both lively and laconic, like his star himself; the movie has the rhythm of a fun \u201970s laid-back thriller but a certain undeniable mournfulness about the passage of time, of growing old, of lessons learned. (There\u2019s a scene with Redford and Spacek talking on the porch about how their younger lives feel like different people all together that leaves a warm haze that never lifts for the rest of the film.) Lowery wrote the script, and it shares several thematic similarities to his last film, A Ghost Story, also starring Affleck. That film was obsessed with the passage of time, to the point that time itself became almost the main character of its story, eternity\u2019s indifference both awing and moving in equal measure. This film is much lighter and straightforward than that movie, but that idea of identity, and how it evolves and stays constant throughout the decades, is foregrounded here, as well. The story of both is the story of time, how it tricks us, and jolts us, and moves us, the person we are the same we have always been, but also not. The Old Man & the Gun is a jaunty joyride, a valedictory for a beloved American icon and a giddy true story. But Lowery ties it all together at the end: It\u2019s a story about how the years go by, and who we are. It\u2019s a story about all of us. \u2014Will Leitch\n\n24. Teen Titans Go! to the Movies\n\nYear: 2018\n\nDirectors: Aaron Horvath, Peter Rida Michail\n\nWith Teen Titans Go! to the Movies, the long-running Cartoon Network series joins the ranks of still-running animated series that were deemed popular enough to get a movie of their very own. Much like The Simpsons Movie and South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, the show\u2019s creators use the opportunity to distill and put on display what has made the show so popular in the first place. The result is one of the funniest \u201csuperhero\u201d films of the year, and one that allows Robin and company to join Deadpool\u2014Statler and Waldorf style\u2014on the balcony poking fun at the clich\u00e9s, blindspots and foibles of the current Big Genre on Campus. When Teen Titans Go! debuted on Cartoon Network in 2013, its chibi design, juvenile humor and overall zany approach drew mixed reactions from fans of the source material. For some, it stemmed from the disappointment of not getting a renewed \u201cserious\u201d series. (The original Teen Titans animated series had ended seven years earlier.) For others, the succession of booty jokes\u2014or any joke hammered at relentlessly for 10-11 minutes\u2014quickly grew tiresome. In Teen Titans Go! to the Movies, creators Michael Jelenic and Aaron Horvath pull off what we\u2019ll call a \u201creverse-Hobbit,\u201d showing how the characters from those 11-minute bursts of mayhem stand up just fine to the \u201crigor\u201d of an 88-minute theatrical release. (Granted, they have more than 200 episodes to draw from and no dearth of tired tropes to target.) The premise of \u201cRobin wants his own movie. What must he do to get one?\u201d is all the framework directors Horvath and Peter Rida Michail need to support a sustained skewering of the current frenzy of superhero moviemaking. \u2014Michael Burgin\n\n23. O.G.\n\nYear: 2019\n\nDirector: Madeleine Sackler\n\nA man who\u2019s committed a terrible crime faces a daunting re-entry into the world outside the walls. In prison he\u2019s been a force, a guy who runs the place. He\u2019s also been a penitent who wishes he could take it all back, and who\u2019s learned the hard way to focus on \u201cdignity, self-respect, and grace,\u201d as he tells a newbie he finds under his wing. But we know, and so does he, that the power dynamics are about to change when he has to reintegrate. An ode to the tight close-up, Madeleine Sackler\u2019s film O.G. stars Jeffrey Wright as Louis, an incarcerated man at the end of a 24-year prison term in Indiana. Shot in an active maximum-security prison and with many incarcerated men and prison staff taking their first turn in front of the camera, O.G. is nonetheless not about filming less-than-conventional actors in a gimmicky way; it\u2019s naturalistic and tempered and organic. It\u2019s committed to a plot-by-accretion, character-driven style, but it\u2019s spare, tightly paced, and contains zero beard-stroking nonsense. It\u2019s visually sophisticated, with subdued colors and bright panes of sunlight and beautifully rendered transitions and lavish close-ups. (Wright does a majority of the acting without saying a word.) Louis, under a veneer of detached calm, is in fact a pretty emotional man. He cares. About his family. About the pain he caused someone else\u2019s family. About doing better, being better. He\u2019s not a bodhisattva; there\u2019s tremendous anger in him, and resentment, and wrath and defensiveness and humiliation. And, it seems\u2014as his release draws closer and as he agrees to a confrontation with his victim\u2019s sister\u2014considerable fear he would rather not make visible. Fear of something happening to jeopardize his freedom, and perhaps greater fear of attaining it. This vivid emotional palette arises almost entirely between the lines in those amazing, lingering shots of Wright\u2019s face. O.G. is an even-handed film in which the eruptions of violence in prison are not handled in a macho determination to be \u201cedgy\u201d or \u201cgritty\u201d or sensationalistic, and because of that it feels realistic. It is a delicate treatment of tough guys and a nonjudgmental look at a broken system, more focused on how men adapt to it than on taking audiences to school about why it\u2019s unfair. The film assumes you know it\u2019s unfair. It\u2019s not going to bother patronizing you about it; it\u2019s going to tell you a story about a decision that permanently altered the course of someone\u2019s life. \u2014Amy Glynn\n\n22. Traffic\n\nYear: 2000\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nAs long as the U.S. keeps demanding copious amounts of drugs, and Latin America keeps providing them, Traffic will remain relevant. Steven Soderbergh\u2019s brutally honest (and therefore grim) ensemble drama about the lucrative-for-some, destructive-for-most drug trade between both halves of our continent plays out like a Cocaine Cowboys version of The Battle of Algiers. As in Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s masterpiece, Soderbergh employs a raw docudrama aesthetic with an even-handed narrative approach to sympathize with and scorn both sides of the issue in equal measure. Catherine Zeta-Jones\u2019s drug kingpin might be a ruthless killer, but Stephen Gaghan\u2019s script, based on a miniseries by Simon Moore, doesn\u2019t shy away from establishing the economic desperation that pushes her to the edge. Michael Douglas\u2019s conservative (and possibly alcoholic) drug czar might talk a good game in public about the U.S.\u2019s no tolerance policy against drugs, but he can\u2019t do anything but witness his daughter\u2019s (Erika Christensen) descent into addiction. Soderbergh shot Traffic himself, and employed a clear blue-vs-yellow color palette between American and Mexican scenes, supporting his themes with clear visual cues. The yellows of Mexico, while warmer and naturalistic, communicate constant danger; the blues of the U.S. convey relative safety, but also moral coldness and emotional distance. Instead of offering any clear answers, Soderbergh and Gaghan stress the immediacy of the issue; their warnings remain unheard to this day. \u2014Oktay Ege Kozak\n\n21. Leaving Neverland\n\nYear: 2019\n\nDirector: Dan Reed\n\nIt\u2019s all heartbreaking. The damage to the psyches of children, certainly, but everything else is sad as hell, too: the endless voracious need for approval at any cost, the radioactive half-life of a lie, the emptiness at the center of fame, the way child abuse is a perpetual motion machine that infects one generation after another. In an oblique way, HBO\u2019s Leaving Neverland is a reminder that the monstrous people who sexually abuse children do not simply drop out of the skies. They are forged. Created. Usually by abusers of their own. You look at Michael Jackson\u2014his collapsing, bleaching face; his skinny little body; his soft, mealy speaking voice\u2014and you can see a victimizer who was also a victim. If we could hold that perception and really understand it, would it change anything? The desire to withhold forgiveness from such people is deep and tenacious, and it\u2019s more than understandable why that\u2019s the case. No one tests the limits of forgiveness quite like someone who has molested children.\n\nThe four hours of Leaving Neverland are characterized by a cavernous sense of aural and visual space. The sound editing is almost uncomfortably intimate; I squirmed at the audible swallowing and breathing sounds in the interview segments. There\u2019s also the way archival photo images are centered deeply in the frames\u2014small, surrounded by black space, static. It\u2019s elliptical, allusive. And effective. The testimony of the two alleged victims (and their mothers and their wives) is uncontested, and they do not affirmatively prove anything, but their stories strike so many of the same chords that you\u2019d have to be awfully spaced out not to notice. The seduction of the boys\u2019 star-struck and ambitious mothers. (Wade Robson\u2019s mom relocated him from Australia to Hollywood, splitting up her family on the promise of Jackson\u2019s mentorship and help.) The extended, extensive grooming process. Manipulative generosity. (A passage where James Safechuck describes Michael taking him to a jeweler to buy him a ring is especially creepy; apparently, Jackson had an elaborate story that James was helping him select something for a woman friend, and the kid\u2019s delicate little fingers were the right size.) Creating a shared secret. We say people who hurt children don\u2019t deserve to be forgiven, but just as it\u2019s a mistake to see Leaving Neverland as a film about Michael Jackson, so is it a distraction to conflate forgiveness with releasing people from accountability. It doesn\u2019t demand that viewers make a call on any of that, which is as it should be. It tells a piercingly sad and highly disturbing story that might or might not change how you feel about Michael Jackson, but will almost certainly draw a haunting, highly detailed sketch of the legacy of damage that ensues when someone violates children. \u2014Amy Glynn\n\n20. Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\n\nYear: 2015\n\nDirector: Alex Gibney\n\nAlex Gibney\u2019s up-close examination of Scientology, its practices and the controversies that surround the religion founded by science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard is also a stirring portrait of eight former adherents, who tell their stories of how they came to practice Scientology and their reasons for leaving the church. While much of the ideological content in Gibney\u2019s film has circulated on the Internet for years, there was still a number of items to be learned from watching the film and hearing from the men who made it. While Going Clear is part expos\u00e9 and part condemnation of a controversial religion, director Gibney has said that he was most interested in \u201cthe journey of the key characters in the film\u201d\u2014and how people got lost in the \u2018prison of belief.\u2019\u201d \u2014Christine N. Ziemba\n\n\n\n19. Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills\n\nYear: 1996\n\nDirectors: Joe Berlinger, Bruce Sinofsky\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of the West Memphis Three, do some research before you begin\u2014you\u2019ll want to be prepared. Within only a minute of the film\u2019s opening, as Metallica\u2019s \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d noodles forebodingly over pixelated camcorder videos, intolerable images taken straight from police evidence glance across frame, so quickly and frankly you\u2019ll immediately question if they are, in fact, real. Of course, they are\u2014they are images no person should ever have to see, and yet Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky use them only to expose the unbelievable horror at the heart of the appropriately named Paradise Lost. What unfolds over the following two and a half hours is just as heartbreaking: a trio of teenage boys (one with an IQ of 72) is put on trial for the brutal murders of three prepubescent boys, the only evidence against them a seemingly forced confession by the young kid with the below-average IQ, and laughably circumstantial physical proof. The film explores the context of West Memphis, its blindly devoted Christian population and how the fact that these teenagers dressed in black and listened to Metallica somehow led to their predictable fates at the hands of a comprehensively broken justice system. With surprising access to everyone involved in the trial, as well as a deft eye for the subtle exigencies of any criminal case such as this, Paradise Lost is a thorough, infuriating glimpse of the kind of mundane evil that mounts in some of America\u2019s quietest corners. Welcome home. \u2014Dom Sinacola\n\n18. Won\u2019t You be My Neighbor?\n\nYear: 2018\n\nDirector: Morgan Neville\n\nMorgan Neville\u2019s winning portrait Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? withholds darkness. Which makes sense since the Oscar-winning director of 20 Feet From Stardom has turned his attention to Fred Rogers, a kindly TV personality who entertained a couple generations of kids with his benign PBS program Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood. Rogers died in 2003 at the age of 74, and this year marks the 50th anniversary of his landmark show, so expect plenty of tributes over the next several months. Appropriately, as an official chronicling of the man\u2019s life and legacy, Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? isn\u2019t remotely innovative. We get polished interviews from colleagues, family members and Rogers\u2019 widow. There are plenty of clips from his show, as well as other archival material. There\u2019s a gimmick-y recurring use of animation to illustrate parts of his story that\u2019s the only truly cloying element of a film that mostly eschews mawkishness. And yet, Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? is a stunningly moving film that also feels just the teensiest bit radical. That word will be used a lot during this golden anniversary for Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood, as his fans remind everyone that, rather than starring a smiling square who couldn\u2019t have looked less manly, the show was actually a pretty progressive program that frankly discussed everything from race relations to John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination. Neville accentuates Rogers\u2019 unembarrassed sweetness as an example of his principled stand against bigotry and injustice, making the case with conviction and gusto.\n\nAt my True/False screening, the audience was warned before Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? that we ought to have Kleenex in hand to prepare for what we were going to experience. I\u2019m an unashamed movie crier, but I resent being prepped for how I should feel about a movie I\u2019m about to see. And yet, the warning was warranted: The tears elicited from Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor? are a testament to Neville\u2019s tasteful, loving (but not fawning) depiction of a decent, unassuming man. The movie\u2019s not just a balm in the age of Trump\u2014it\u2019s an opportunity for viewers to reconnect with their own decency, and Neville\u2019s gentle skill at arguing for goodness ends up being a minor miracle. \u2014Tim Grierson\n\n17. Bessie\n\nYear: 2015\n\nDirector: Dee Rees\n\nIt may have taken 20 years to make it, but when Bessie finally arrived, she came, she saw and she conquered. The HBO film has garnered 12 well-deserved Emmy nominations, with Queen Latifah, co-stars Michael Kenneth Williams and Mo\u2019Nique, and director Dee Rees all getting the nod. One scene in particular\u2014with the reverse paper bag test\u2014is one of Bessie\u2019s finest moments, as it encompasses all that makes the HBO film so wonderful. There\u2019s Queen Latifah in all her glory, finally setting up her own tour and making sure everyone knows who\u2019s boss. There\u2019s the hilarity when she lets down one of the hopefuls auditioning\u2014\u201cYou must be darker than the bag to be in my show!\u201d After all, Bessie is an incredibly funny movie at times. And there\u2019s the whole inversion of the brown paper bag test. Where Bessie Smith grew up in a world that demanded black women performing back-up be lighter than a brown paper bag, Bessie makes up a new rule that gives her back some agency and sets a different tone (literally and figuratively) for her showcase. Bessie was, in no way, your average blues performer and for that reason Lili Fini Zanuck and her husband Richard D. Zanuck knew they couldn\u2019t just deliver your average black-performer-who-grew-up-poor-and-made-it-big biopic. The familiar story of a talented woman done in by a man (or many men), or childhood tragedies, or her own celebrity was not Bessie\u2019s story\u2014she wasn\u2019t lighter than a brown paper bag, and, thankfully, wasn\u2019t presented as such. \u2014Shannon M. Houston\n\n\n\n16. American Splendor\n\nYear: 2003\n\nDirectors: Robert Pulcini, Shari Springer Berman\n\nHarvey Pekar\u2019s \u201cAmerican Splendor\u201d books are fascinating: Pekar believed that even the most mundane and seemingly uncomplicated lives were worth documenting. American Splendor showcases this theory by combining real footage of Pekar, fictionalized versions of characters from his life\u2014maintaining both stylized caricatures and naturalistic drama\u2014and even animated segments pulled from the comics to create a cohesive whole that presents an ordinary life as a fascinating experience. \u2014Ross Bonaime\n\n\n\n15. Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\nYear: 1989\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\n\u201cIs there a God? And if so, is He watching?\u201d Woody Allen\u2019s somber meditation on this variant of the Big Question centers on two, vaguely interrelated stories: A successful ophthalmologist (Martin Landau) takes drastic measures to deal with an increasingly threatening mistress (Anjelica Huston) while a married filmmaker (Allen) finds himself attracted to the assistant (Mia Farrow) of his egotistical brother-in-law (Alan Alda). The events that follow leave the viewer uncomfortably aware of just how unanswerable some questions can be. This philosophical discomfort has only been heightened in the years since as it\u2019s become much harder for some\u2014and impossible for many\u2014to enjoy Allen\u2019s films in light of the accusations that have been leveled against him. This has especially been the case in films where Allen writes his stand-in character\u2014often Allen himself\u2014exhibiting the same school of misbehavior he\u2019s accused of in real life. (See Manhattan.) In Crimes and Misdemeanors, this autobiographical gloss has additional resonance, as the script wrestles with whether misbehavior, even the most egregious, truly gets punished (and implies, if not, why not behave as you will?). It\u2019s hard not to read the initial guilt, then relief and return to normalcy of Martin Landau\u2019s character as, on some level, authorial wish fulfillment. \u2014Michael Burgin\n\n\n\n14. Am\u00e9lie\n\nYear: 2001\n\nDirector: Jean-Pierre Jeunet\n\nDelicate and delicious, Am\u00e9lie is an easily, exceedingly lovable little French trifle. With the face of an angel, the heart of a child and the haircut of a Parisian pixie, Am\u00e9lie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) sweeps us clean off our feet while Tautou launches herself into the American consciousness as the do-gooding waitress who sends her secret crush photos and riddles, masking her identity in order to make their first encounter\u2014and first kiss\u2014the most romantic moment of her life. Her fantastical adventures\u2014in the name of idealized, even cinematic, coupling\u2014unfold in flights of magical realism, Jean-Pierre Jeunet holding up love itself as both realistically magical and magically realistic. \u2014Nick Marino\n\n13. The Tale\n\nYear: 2018\n\nDirector: Jennifer Fox\n\nJennifer Fox has just done something utterly brilliant, and you need to see it. Be prepared to feel uncomfortable, because The Tale, adapted from her narrative memoir of the same name, will do a number on your head, in the way that a particularly vivid nightmare sometimes can, whether you personally have a childhood sexual abuse story or not. This film was made three years ago. It\u2019s not a response to or the property of any movement, any hashtag; it\u2019s not finally, finally pulling back the veil on the terrible stories no one ever told until now. We have always told these stories. They have always existed and we have always told them. We just didn\u2019t do it with hashtags. To even characterize this film as \u201ca story about sexual abuse\u201d would be a shallow read on a very deep work of art. The Tale is, at a certain level, \u201cabout\u201d sexual abuse. But focus on that for too long and you\u2019ll miss the astonishing, courageous, gorgeous mosaic of ways in which it is deliberately, doggedly and totally not. This is a film about the morphing quicksand terrain of human memory and it\u2019s about the stories we tell ourselves in order to stay sane and most of all it\u2019s about the Plinian, volcanic power of emotional honesty. If you want to talk about the spirit of the moment, the guiding spirit of the times, maybe we need to pan back from anything as specific as sexual abuse of girls and women and talk about why being honest is the ultimate act of revolution. Plenty of people make autobiographical films. The Tale is so deeply and specifically autobiographical that it almost becomes something else. Fox as director and writer puts her documentarian\u2019s tools to work to create a meta-textual tapestry depicting the ways in which our memories inform (and misinform) our self-concept. And this beautiful, gripping, disturbing film deserves to be looked at with as much nuance as it offers. It manages to dive so deeply into the personal that it explodes into something universal. \u2014Amy Glynn\n\n12. Drugstore Cowboy\n\nYear: 1989\n\nDirector: Gus Van Sant\n\nGus Van Sant\u2019s sophomore feature film was the filmmaker\u2019s huge breakout, earning him near-universal critical acclaim. And it\u2019s ridiculously easy to understand why: Drugstore Cowboy is a propulsive, gripping slice of cinema. Based on a semi-autobiographical novel by James Fogle, Cowboy features an electric lead performance in Matt Dillon as Bob, a junkie who, along with girlfriend Diane (Kelly Lynch), friends Rick (James LeGros) and Nadine (a young Heather Graham), robs pharmacies while getting high on their supply in and around Portland, Ore. in 1971. The film veers wildly between bleak drug-addled hellscape, paranoid delusions and pitch-black comedy. That it does so in a way that is perfectly in service with\u2014even elevating\u2014the story being told is the best testament to the talent and discipline of Van Sant as a writer/director. And, really, who could resist a movie featuring both funny and tragic drug overdoses that actually casts William S. Burroughs as a junkie priest? \u2014Scott Wold\n\n11. The Prestige\n\nYear: 2006\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nIn The Prestige, two competing magicians try to outdo each other, but are really trying to achieve a brand of immortality. They are competing for the same audience\u2019s faith, and they need all of it, because it is not something that can be shared (many religious institutions hold similar dogma for similar reasons). Each wants to invoke utter and absolute belief in their audiences, much like Nolan wants to do in his own, as if that achievement grants the doer divinity, whether or not it is built on tricks and illusions. Nolan begins the film with a trick, in fact, a shot of top hats littering the forest floor, with the voice-over asking, \u201cAre you watching closely?\u201d It is a shot out of time and place from the rest of the film, Nolan once again doing as he pleases, manipulating our perception of what we\u2019re seeing and when so as to emulate the pledge, turn and prestige of the \u201cmagic\u201d acts the film portrays. Our faith is built on lies we tell ourselves and others, Nolan seems to posit, and it\u2019s a thesis on which he elaborates with his Dark Knight trilogy, insinuating that symbols are sacred not for their truth, but simply for what they inspire. \u2014Chad Betz\n\n\n\n10. Deadwood: The Movie\n\nYear: 2019\n\nDirector: Daniel Minihan\n\nA decade has passed in Deadwood between the show\u2019s finale and Deadwood: The Movie, and longer has come and gone in the real world. Beloved characters have vacated the town, passed away with the beloved actors behind them. Deadwood isn\u2019t used to that much temporal space. The longest narrative gap it ever weathered over the course of its 2004-2006 run was a seven month stretch hastening an affair and a bonanza gold mine. It\u2019s a show where events and episodes occur over hours, where the threat of even minor change can send its entrenched group of outcasts to the brothel-worn mattresses. As South Dakota looks to enter the United States, Deadwood is about to finish the painful pubescence it began during the show and finally grow up. It left off with seething, begrudging closure\u2014the kind found after a lopsided armistice\u2014when gold magnate George Hearst (Gerald McRaney) strong-armed Alma Garret (Molly Parker) into selling her lucrative claim by, among other things, having her husband murdered. With all parties in that conflict returning to town to celebrate this new statehood, irredentism and its dictatorial opposite come into conflict. Hearst may own the town, but nobody stays bitter like a Deadwood resident. Tragic reunions, new beginnings, and those signature beatings\u2014all the run-ins, disappointments, and excitements good fan service requires are included in its wide-ranging story. And the funerals have gotten way more elaborate since Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) and Sol Star (John Hawkes) buried the murderer Ned Mason in the show\u2019s second episode.\n\nEveryone, including the protagonistic owners of the hardware store, gets a life update. Community leader, killer, and brothel/bar operator Al Swearengen (Ian McShane) is on a jaundiced decline as law enters the land. Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert) has somehow survived her alcoholism, but is even more death-obsessed than she was after Wild Bill Hickok\u2019s murder. Some get more detail than others, like Joanie Stubbs (Kim Dickens) or Mr. Wu (Keone Young), who merely drop by for familiarity\u2019s sake and to help the characters actually doing something during the movie. Some of these developments are propped up by flashbacks that could be clip show-ish; others more delicate and wistful recollections whose images reignite the pain we haven\u2019t seen these characters experience in 10 years. They\u2019re obsessive fragments, moments of time snipped, captured, and replayed like a haunting tune stuck in their heads. The focus on memory feels natural, but it\u2019s perhaps even more understandable when taking into account the Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis of show creator David Milch (who also wrote the film). The \u201ccuriosity, bitterness, and incredulity\u201d of mental decline meets the \u201cunflinching dignity\u201d of idealism, something seen in every corner of Deadwood\u2019s hard, angry, honorable inhabitants. Time, and the perspective its passage brings, is new for the show. But its addition only serves to cement its legacy as one of the best ever. As a series capper, the movie is a satisfying, loving end that fulfills old Deadwood\u2019s imperfect promises while mostly avoiding the pitfalls of nostalgia. \u2014Jacob Oller\n\n9. Capturing the Friedmans\n\nYear: 2003\n\nDirector: Andrew Jarecki\n\nThis is the story of Arnold Friedman and his son Jesse, convicted of multiple counts of child molestation that supposedly took place in the basement of their home in a quiet New York suburb during the \u201980s. In Capturing the Friedmans, filmmaker Andrew Jarecki interviews the victims and prosecutors, but never reaches a conclusion as to the veracity of the charges, tacitly acknowledging that guilt and innocence are fluid concepts in such sensational and shameful circumstances. Instead, he documents the implosion of the family and the destruction of an already tenuous marriage. Surely, the details of the abuse are disturbing, but almost as unsettling is the cruelty with which the two older Friedmans reject their mother in blind loyalty to their shamefaced father and numb younger brother, further facilitating the family\u2019s emotional separation. \u2014Emily Reimer\n\n8. BlacKkKlansman\n\nYear: 2018\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nBlacKkKlansman begins, in vintage Spike fashion, with a big Oliver Stone-esque set piece featuring a racist \u201cscholar\u201d named Dr. Kennebrew Beaureguard (Alec Baldwin) delivering a demented, bigoted speech straight to the camera, but then, for a brief while, the movie settles down to tell its real-life story. In 1970s Colorado, a man named Ron Stallworth (John David Washington, son of Denzel) joins the police department and, after dealing with discrimination within the force itself, decides to go undercover and take down the local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, talking to its members on the phone while using his white, Jewish partner Flip (Adam Driver) to serve as his in-person representative. The two slowly infiltrate the Colorado KKK and end up corresponding with the KKK\u2019s grand wizard, David Duke (Topher Grace), who becomes so infatuated with Ron that he comes to Colorado to meet him. Meanwhile, Ron falls for a local radical (Laura Herrier) and attempts to figure out whether he can square the circle of being a good police office and a conscientious, vigilant black man. This is a Spike Lee movie, so the straightforward story you might have gotten from Get Out\u2019s Jordan Peele\u2014who was originally going to make this film as his follow up but instead produces here\u2014keeps taking all sorts of detours, mostly with the intent of reminding you that there\u2019s a direct line between the shithead Klansmen of this time period and the shitheads in Charlottesville\u2026and the White House itself. Lee shook himself out of his brief academic torpor with 2015\u2019s Chi-Raq, a wildly unfocused but deeply passionate movie, and he evolves further here, his outrage and sadness seeping out of every frame. It can be a little on the nose sometimes\u2014one discussion of racism in the Oval Office is so overt you half expect the word \u201cTRUMP\u201d to just start flashing on the screen\u2014but Spike Lee is at his best when he\u2019s on the nose. Lee is too urgent, too furious, to have time to lull you in with subtlety and nuance: When the house is on fire, you don\u2019t worry about what kind of hoses you have, you just spray that shit with everything you have. Lee is shaking with rage at what he sees in the world right now, and for crissakes, he should be. His excesses don\u2019t just seem powerful; they\u2019re necessary. You can sort out all the particulars later: The house is on fire right now. \u2014Will Leitch\n\n7. Isle of Dogs\n\nYear: 2018\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nIsle of Dogs may be the closest Wes Anderson will ever get to a sci-fi film. Of course he would use stop-motion animation to make it. Set 20 years from now, amidst the ultra-urban monoliths of Megasaki City\u2014a Japanese metropolis that also seems to be Japan, or at least a Westernized idea of the small island nation\u2014the film begins care of a decree by Mayor Kobayashi (Kunichi Nomura), a boulder of a man with equal ties to an ancient lineage of cat-loving aristocrats and to, based on the elaborate back tattoo we glimpse atop his tight little butt in a quick bath scene, an archetype of organized crime and political corruption. Due to a vaguely described epidemic of \"dog flu\" (or \"snout fever\"), Kobayashi bans all dogs to Trash Island, a massive byproduct of technology and futurism, beginning with Spots (Liev Schreiber), the guard dog of 12-year-old Atari (Koyu Rankin), who also happens to be the Mayor\u2019s ward after Atari\u2019s parents died in a horrible accident. Since Bottle Rocket in 1996, the more manicured Anderson\u2019s films have become\u2014his obsessive control over his frames broadening into grander and grander worlds\u2014the more we may be apt to extol his accomplishments rather than get invested in his stories. And it\u2019s probably never been easier to do that than with Isle of Dogs, so rife with meticulousness and imagination, as is Anderson\u2019s brand, and so unconcerned with steering this ostensible children\u2019s movie towards actual children. For a director who pretty much defined a generation\u2019s cinematic fetishization for symmetry (and quirky hipster nonsense) to then fetishize a country to which Westerners mainly relate through fetishization? So much of this beautiful movie just sort of eats itself. Still, the emotional weight of Isle of Dogs depends on knowing exactly what that bond between dog and human can mean, how deeply and irrationally it can go. At the core of Isle of Dogs is that kind of best-friendship: No matter how far we advance as a civilization, how disastrously we atomize and digitalize our lives, we\u2019ll always have the devoted dependence of a dog, our immutable companion across the vast wasteland of human history. \u2014Dom Sinacola\n\n6. Mean Girls\n\nYear: 2004\n\nDirector: Mark Waters\n\nBefore Tina Fey got stubborn\u2014before sometimes thoughtful critiques of her occasionally limited perspective encouraged the reactionary, heel-in-ground attitude about the politics of identity and changing social norms\u2014she was one of the most thoughtful writers and creators to engage with both of those subject matters, and how we talk about them. A crucial part of what made 30 Rock one of the smartest sitcoms in history was its investigation of what we talk about when we talk about identity politics. A lot of that sharpness has its origins in Fey\u2019s 2004 screenplay debut, Mean Girls, a dark comedy in the vein of Heathers and Clueless, scrutinizing the social dynamics of high school and, in particular, how young women treat one another and themselves. Through the eyes of new kid, formerly homeschooled Cady Harron (Lindsay Lohan), the film submerges the audience in the nasty politics of \u201cgirl world\u201d as she tries to make friends, schemes against the popular girls, and loses sight of herself in the process. Adapted from Rosalind Wiseman\u2019s nonfiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends, and Other Realities of Adolescence , Mean Girls has its own unique edge apart from 30 Rock, not just as a high school movie, but as a movie that dives into the operations of hierarchical systems. And for Fey, language is the key to unlocking how these high school cliques work. Fey\u2019s lauded for her film\u2019s memorable lines (quotes like \u201cstop trying to make fetch happen\u201d and \u201ctoo gay to function\u201d live on, at least in meme form), but Mean GIrls is an impressive example of translating Rosalind Wiseman\u2019s nonfiction, sociological approach into narrative and fictive application. When Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damien (Daniel Franzese) introduce her to the various lunch room groups, they give her the vocabulary to describe them from then on. Taxonomical breakdowns of high school are almost blas\u00e9 at this point, but director Mark Waters and Fey give a potency to the language of that social environment.\n\nAs Cady socializes into 2004-era high school life and finds her image growing in popularity, she must continually learn the nomenclature of high school and, effectively, of white femininity. Regina George (Rachel McAdams), a social leader of sorts, plays that game with her: \u201cSo you agree? You think you\u2019re really pretty?\u201d Regina jabs, establishing what the correct conversational and syntactical routine should be when someone compliments you. Later, the titular Girls\u2014Regina, Gretchen (Lacey Chabert), Karen (Amanda Seyfried) and Cady\u2014all look at themselves in the mirror pointing out their flaws. But the significance of this scene isn\u2019t merely that Cady engages with the body politics of white womanhood, it\u2019s that she is given the language with which to do so. Essentially, Mean Girls focuses on how the high schoolers codify social dynamics\u2014how they articulate where they or other people fall taxonomically\u2014via class, gender and race. As time passes, Mean Girls\u2019s imitators seem flaccid by comparison. The film\u2019s unpacking of the cruelty of internalized misogyny has, over the course of nearly a decade and a half, grown more acidic, its schemes and backtalking as scalding as it ever was. \u2014Kyle Turner\n\n5. In the Bedroom\n\nYear: 2001\n\nDirector: Todd Field\n\nBased on a story by Andre Dubus, Todd Field\u2019s In the Bedroom is a quiet, understated and devastating exploration of grief in the aftermath of a happy family torn apart by the murder of Frank Fowler (Nick Stahl) by his girlfriend Natalie\u2019s (Marisa Tomei) ex (William Mapother). Of course, Nick\u2019s parents (Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson) handle the loss of their son in very different ways, inevitably alienating themselves from each other, compounding their isolation and profound loss. Field\u2019s directorial debut is an arresting (and emotionally exhausting) work, combining elements of romance, drama and the taut tension of a very good thriller to reveal and unfold the story at the core of the film, which is Spacek and Wilkinson\u2019s joint and individual journeys to contend with the utterly life-shattering experience of unexpectedly losing a child. The shifts from grief to anger and blame to guilt to need are incredibly real, and Spacek and Wilkinson deliver stellar, deeply nuanced performances. Field was critically lauded for the restrained style of the film, and for good reason: This is a riveting character study, the deepest, fathomless of dives into the psychology of family in the midst of loss. \u2014Amy Glynn\n\n\n\n4. Paddington 2\n\nYear: 2018\n\nDirector: Paul King\n\nA sequel to 2014\u2019s Paddington, Paddington 2 picks up where its predecessor left off, with Paddington Brown (n\u00e9 Bear and voiced by Ben Whishaw) living contentedly with his human family, including Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey) and a newly name-recognizable Sally Hawkins (The Shape of Water), joined by that British A-Lister of yore Hugh Grant, dramatic heavyweight Brendan Gleeson, and many others. (In fact, one of the simple joys for parents watching the film lies in recognizing this or that British actor.) A simple, commendable desire to find a good gift for his Aunt Lucy (currently spending her days in a nice retirement home for bears in Lima, Peru, natch) leads Paddington to set his eyes on a certain antique pop-up book as the perfect present. When that scoundrel and fading thespian Phoenix Buchanan (Grant) also sets his sights on the same book, well, hijinks, misunderstandings and adventure ensue. Paddington 2 reminds us how difficult it can be to pull off a sweetly tempered, gently moving children\u2019s movie by doing exactly that, and doing it so well. \u2014Michael Burgin\n\n3. Collateral\n\nYear: 2004\n\nDirector: Michael Mann\n\nAgainst the prelapsarian streets of LA, awash in neon gray and all but devoid of life, Michael Mann tells of urban loneliness and the powerful inconsequentiality of modern life. His Collateral breathes that amorality\u2014not nihilism, just the acceptance that belief and associated ethical choices fail to survive the pointlessness of the day-to-day\u2014and in turn at times both looks like shit (cinematographers Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron shot mostly in digital, occasionally in 35 mm) and aches painfully with the pristine coldness of enduring that shit. Max (Jamie Foxx), a cabbie with big dreams he\u2019s relegated to a frayed postcard, picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise), a cross between Karl Lagerfeld and the T-1000, who draws Max into a long night of murder, threatening the mild-mannered driver into chaffeuring him, impressive hitman, from one job to another. That simple plan of course devolves into a thriller buoyed by two titanic performances\u2014Foxx a slope-shouldered nebbish still trying to convince himself he\u2019s more than a cab driver, and Cruise as an impeccable psychopath\u2014but Mann never loses sight of the vacuum, of the empty melancholy, at the heart of his story: That in the City of Angels, no one is looking out for us. \u2014Dom Sinacola\n\n2. When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts\n\nDirector: Spike Lee\n\nYear: 2006\n\nPart indictment of FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, part celebration of the unfailingly resilient spirit of New Orleans, Spike Lee\u2019s four-hour-long look at \u201cThe City That Care Forgot\u201d a year after the near-obliteration of Hurricane Katrina is an exhausting, comprehensive, worthwhile experience. There\u2019s a reason so many residents refer to the catastrophe as the \u201cFederal flood\u201d and not Katrina itself\u2014Lee\u2019s Peabody-winning doc examines the systemic failure at all levels of government to maintain the storm barriers and deal with the consequences of their negligence. It\u2019s political, it\u2019s racial, it\u2019s accusatory and it\u2019s utterly compelling viewing. It\u2019s also inspiring, thanks to the resolute locals shown struggling to survive and rebuild in the disaster\u2019s aftermath. This is very much a Spike Lee joint; don\u2019t expect anyone in the Dubya administration to come away without a tongue-lashing. But the heart and soul of the doc is the people of New Orleans, and they won\u2019t let you down\u2014on the contrary. \u2014Amanda Schurr\n\n1. Annie Hall\n\nYear: 1977\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nThe sole best picture winner in Woody Allen\u2019s canon\u2014or whatever amounts to his legacy nowadays\u2014Annie Hall succeeds in many forms, not the least as a great romantic comedy, simply because it patiently takes the time to reveal a relationship\u2019s many moments, major and not so much\u2014the wide spectrum of happy and sad, of bittersweet and just plain bitter. From fighting over which movie to see, to laughing while chasing down lobsters in the kitchen, Allen\u2019s film grasps the delicacy of how such a bond can shift imperceptibly from bliss to something else entirely. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Allen\u2019s wit and humor is perfectly matched (even challenged) by Diane Keaton, in her iconic, Oscar-winning performance. However his films have soured sense, Annie Hall remains an enduring classic. \u2014Jeremy Medina\n\n", "images": ["https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/A-Star-Is-Born-header.jpg", "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/images/master-header-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/A-Star-Is-Born-header.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paste Movies Staff", "Dom Sinacola", "Jim Vorel", "Allison Keene", "Cole Henry", "Savannah Sicurella", "Shane Ryan", "Christine Fernando", "Garrett Martin", "Paste Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/01/the-50-best-movies-on-hbo-go-and-hbo-now-january-2.html?p=2", "title": "The 50 Best Movies on HBO Right Now", "meta_data": {"title": "The 50 Best Movies on HBO Right Now - Paste Magazine", "description": "Here are the best movies HBO has to offer this month.", "keywords": ", The 50 Best Movies on HBO Right Now, Lists, Lists, Articles, Paste", "fb": {"admins": 1185614656, "app_id": 127550380613969, "pages": 18512903240}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Paste Magazine", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/A-Star-Is-Born-header.jpg", "width": 633, "height": 356}, "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/01/the-50-best-movies-on-hbo-go-and-hbo-now-january-2.html", "title": "The 50 Best Movies on HBO Right Now", "site_name": "pastemagazine.com", "description": "Here are the best movies HBO has to offer this month."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@pastemagazine", "title": "The 50 Best Movies on HBO Right Now", "description": "Here are the best movies HBO has to offer this month.", "image": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/A-Star-Is-Born-header.jpg"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "8f36922bc91ba221f10d82c407d8b6a9"}, "viewport": "viewport-fit=cover, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.pastemagazine.com", "summary": ""}
