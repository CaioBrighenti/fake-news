And so her story isn\u2019t just about astounding achievement but also about personal growth and resilience. \u201cI was eviscerated,\u201d she recalls about the press on Gigli. \u201cI lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship [with Affleck] self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\u201d She has also conquered what was once her biggest fear: being alone. Last August, she broke up with dancer Casper Smart in an effort to learn how. \u201cShe\u2019s a seeker,\u201d says her close friend Leah Remini, the actress and anti-Scientology activist. \u201cShe\u2019s always trying to improve herself, her relationships, be a better friend, a better daughter, a better mother, a better person. She\u2019s not closed-minded.\u201d IN STEP\n\n\u201cAlex doesn\u2019t let anything beat him,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cHe just comes back stronger.\u201d Photograph by Mario Testino. If self-doubt and self-reflection aren\u2019t what you\u2019d expect from a diva, it\u2019s striking how little diva there is to Lopez these days. Goldsmith-Thomas, who, in 2004, was diagnosed with Stage Three breast cancer, recalls that Lopez would show up for her chemo appointments. \u201cShe made me very popular on the chemo ward!,\u201d Goldsmith says. \u201cShe\u2019d bring clothing for everyone from her Sweetface line and she\u2019d rub my bald head and talk about dreams. It was really important to talk about the future because she wanted me to know there was one. That girl saved my life.\u201d Rodriguez tells me that Lopez is happiest at home, in pj\u2019s, eating chocolate-chip cookies with friends. She and Rodriguez like to talk in terms of \u201creveals\u201d: the unexpected moments that tell you who someone else is. An early one for him, he says, was discovering that Lopez was \u201cthe role model for health and wellness. She rarely drinks. She tries to get at least eight hours of sleep.\u201d He adds, \u201cThat helps explain why she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d She\u2019s also been willing to take risks to stay relevant, no easy task in a world where female stars are widely believed to have an expiration date. In 2010, she agreed to become a judge on American Idol, which some people derided as a comedown. But it worked. \u201cViewers who knew only an attention-grabbing siren met a hardworking, self-made, empathetic single mother,\u201d observed Forbes. \u201cNo one from my team wanted me to do American Idol except Benny,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cBut I felt I had something to offer, and in the back of my mind, I thought, Maybe people will get to know me a little bit better.\u201d She adds, \u201cWith reality TV, you can\u2019t hide who you are. You just can\u2019t. It\u2019s going to come through.\u201d Rookie Season\n\nAs Lopez was becoming J.Lo, so Alex Rodriguez was becoming A-Rod. He was just 18 and the youngest player in the league when he made his debut with the Mariners, in July 1994. He turned in a series of impressive stats that galvanized the baseball world\u2014like becoming the youngest player to hit 500 home runs. For the 2001 season, he was offered a record-breaking 10-year $252 million contract by the Texas Rangers. In 2004, Rodriguez was traded to the New York Yankees, and in 2007 he negotiated another 10-year deal. Like Lopez, Rodriguez is not a child of privilege. He too was born in New York City. When Alex was eight, his parents, immigrants from the Dominican Republic, moved the family to Miami, where his mother became a secretary in an immigration office and waited tables at night. When he was 10, his dad moved out of the house. \ufffcWEIGHTY MATTERS\n\nThe two put so much pressure on themselves \u201cto do something great,\u201d she says. Photograph by Mario Testino. As with Lopez, success made him feel not comfort and security but a near-desperate drive to succeed even more. (And you can see how questions such as CAN ALEX RODRIGUEZ PROVE HE\u2019S WORTH $252 MILLION? would foster that attitude in a young athlete.) \u201cMy No. 1 goal was to give R.O.I. [return on investment] to owners who believed in me,\u201d he recalls. In 2008, his marriage to Cynthia Scurtis, with whom he had daughters Natasha and Ella, broke up, due to his relationship with Madonna, and his dates with stars from Kate Hudson to Cameron Diaz became tabloid fodder. Plus, there were the injuries: two major hip surgeries, two knee surgeries. \u201cWe\u2019re both like this,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cWe put so much pressure on ourselves to be great, to be the best all the time. We understood that about each other. When we came together it was \u2018Oh my God, I was the same way.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRodriguez\u2019s career was ultimately sidelined by the steroid scandal, which rocked Major League Baseball in the mid-2000s. Rodriguez had earlier admitted using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers, but adamantly denied he\u2019d continued the practice while with the Yankees. After a protracted fight with both the Yankees and the M.L.B., Rodriguez was suspended for an entire season\u2014one of the largest penalties in baseball history\u2014in early 2014. \u201cI was hoping the suspension would be shorter,\u201d he says today. \u201cI remember when Tony Clark, the head of our union, called me and said, \u2018It\u2019s a full season\u2014it\u2019s 162 [games],\u2019 it was a knife to my ribs.\u201d Rodriguez says he didn\u2019t leave his house for seven days. \u201cI thought I\u2019d played my last game. I grew a beard\u2014as much as I can grow it\u2014and didn\u2019t want to see anyone, including my kids.\u201d I ask him what he learned during that year. \u201cDo you have enough time?\u201d he asks. As he talks, Lopez nestles into him. \u201cI started brushing myself off, thinking, How do I come back into the world?\u201d he says. The year off, he realized, could give him the chance to heal not just his body but also his mind. \u201cI felt I could work on myself, understand why I kept making mistakes. . . . In a weird way, 2014 will be the best thing that ever happened to me. It forced a paradigm shift.\u201d He continues: \u201cI remember thinking one night . . . Don\u2019t know if I told you this, babe [he says to Lopez] . . . In the middle of this craziness, I remember it\u2019s three A.M., four A.M., and like many nights, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m not a crier, but I\u2019m bawling. . . . My pillows are now soaking wet, and it\u2019s the middle of the night, and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m the only fucking asshole that gets pocket aces and figures out a way to lose the hand. I was so angry at myself, so pissed off, that it was hard to breathe.\u201d \u201cHow did you get through?\u201d I ask. \u201cHelp,\u201d he says. \u201cThe work I did, that was one of the most painful and most rewarding experiences of my life, and it continues to this day. I tell myself, \u2018I\u2019m rounding first base and going to second base. It\u2019s a process.\u2019 \u201d He says he decided to do like Rocky Balboa, to try to make the team \u201cas a broken-down 40-year-old that didn\u2019t have a lot of allies.\u201d And he succeeded, finishing the season with 33 home runs. \u201cI did that at 40 and 100 percent clean, and no one can take that away from me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt told me everything about who I was.\u201d When he retired, he agreed to stay on as an adviser to Yankee owner Hal Steinbrenner and as a mentor to younger players. \u201cFrom where I came from, that honor is like hitting 800,\u201d he says. This, to Lopez, was a reveal. \u201cThe most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person,\u201d she says. \u201cThe hardest times prove who you are. That\u2019s what I love and admire the most about Alex. He doesn\u2019t let anything beat him. He just comes back stronger.\u201d Each believes that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn\u2019t have worked. \u201cWe had to grow and discover ourselves first,\u201d she says. But it also works for another reason. As Goldsmith-Thomas says, \u201cThey weren\u2019t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.\u201d\n\nThe next night, Lopez is performing her smash show All I Have in Las Vegas. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy\u2014with a sense of humor\u2014to a festive Latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings Lee Ann Womack\u2019s \u201cI Hope You Dance.\u201d She\u2019s an incandescent performer, partly because, as Remini says, \u201cthere is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.\u201d \u201cA-Rod\u2019s in the house,\u201d someone from the audience yells. She laughs. Yes, A-Rod is in the house. Although he\u2019s seen the show many times, he\u2019s still watching every detail. He nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to \u201cJenny from the Block.\u201d Then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch Lopez\u2019s feet. During a segment that\u2019s all New York, with Lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. \u201cIf you look closely, you\u2019ll see what number she\u2019s wearing on her jersey,\u201d he says. It\u2019s 13, his Yankee number. He says, \u201cWe are very much twins.\u201d She says, \u201cI understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could.\u201d Earlier that day, she and Rodriguez were in Los Angeles at the premiere event for this season\u2019s Shark Tank, in which Rodriguez will be the first Latino shark. At a panel where the sharks discussed the show, the investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says, \u201cA lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when Alex came in, he knew his stuff cold.\u201d During the red-carpet interviews, Lopez, who is impossibly glamorous in a floor-length tweed coat and aviator sunglasses, hangs at the back of the crowd. \u201cDoes it feel weird to be in the background?\u201d I ask. \u201cNoooo,\u201d she says. \u201cI like it. Because I\u2019m out there enough. Some people, it wouldn\u2019t work\u2014they can\u2019t stand not being the one in the spotlight. But not us.\u201d Back in Business\n\nTheir story is also a merger of business empires. Lopez, who back in 2002\u2014way before everyone else was becoming an entrepreneur\u2014launched her fragrance Glow by J.Lo, now has a big portfolio of business interests, which range from her production company to sprawling property holdings. Rodriguez seems to slot right into her world. From a young age, he sought out mentors who could help him build a business that would one day replace his baseball income. During his suspension year, he took investing classes at Columbia and marketing classes at the University of Miami. Today, A-Rod Corp is an investment firm focused on a broad array of industries, including real estate, sports and wellness, media, and entertainment. \u201cI don\u2019t have your traditional formal education,\u201d he says. \u201cMine comes through reading and passion and grit and collecting a lot of information from my mentors. I\u2019ve never been afraid to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know. Can you explain that to me?\u2019 That\u2019s echoed by hedge-fund billionaire Marc Lasry, who has invested with Rodriguez for the last decade. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about Alex is that he\u2019s a sponge,\u201d Lasry says. \u201cHe really wants to learn.\u201d Another mentor of sorts is Mary Callahan Erdoes, the C.E.O. of J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, who met Rodriguez around the time that Lasry did. \u201cYou might be expecting something different,\u201d she says. \u201cBut from the first day, he had his notebook out. He\u2019s incredibly curious and serious. There\u2019s no nonsense and no pomp and circumstance.\u201d That\u2019s true to this day, Erdoes says, whether he\u2019s attending a JPMorgan-hosted conference on Brexit or a meeting with a hedge-fund manager. \u201cHe sits in the front of the room with his notebook out and his hand up, asking questions,\u201d she says. Rodriguez\u2019s innate curiosity\u2014about business, about other people, about fresh concepts\u2014makes him stand out in a world where many people lack that trait. \u201cThe real reason people do deals with Alex is that they like him and he\u2019s smart,\u201d says Lasry. \ufffcCAUGHT HER FANCY\n\nThe couple met 12 years ago at Shea Stadium but didn\u2019t date till last winter. Photograph by Mario Testino.\n\nProminent on Rodriguez\u2019s list of mentors is eminent investor Warren Buffett, whom Rodriguez met when Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway underwrote disability insurance for his contract with the Rangers. Rodriguez sent Buffett a thank-you note and asked if he could come visit, thinking he\u2019d get a quick \u201cNo.\u201d But Buffett said yes, and Rodriguez has counted him as a friend ever since. Buffett tells me that Rodriguez \u201chas what I call a \u2018money mind,\u2019 meaning he instinctively knows many things about dealing with money that other people never learn and to some extent can\u2019t be taught.\u201d Buffett adds, \u201cA-Rod would have done very well in business if he had never seen a baseball.\u201d What\u2019s the best advice Buffett has ever given him? \u201cOn the business side, it was always non-recourse debt,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cDon\u2019t personally guarantee it. And cash is like oxygen: you need it, but you don\u2019t need too much of it. You\u2019d rather have your money in great businesses.\u201d Rodriguez recalls that one day long ago Buffett gave him a different kind of advice. \u201cHe said, \u2018I have two things for you,\u2019 \u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cI asked, \u2018Do you mind if I take out a notebook?\u2019 Warren said, \u2018Go ahead, but you won\u2019t need it. Number one: Be the best baseball player you can be. Number two: Always be a gentleman. Be the best guy you can be.\u2019 . . . That was simple, but it was so genius.\u201d The couple is taking his advice to heart. Days after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico, Lopez gave $1 million to help its victims there, and she and Rodriguez asked their contacts in Hollywood and in the business world to raise $26 million. In mid-October, Lopez, together with Rodriguez and her ex-husband Marc Anthony, organized a benefit concert and telethon that brought in an additional $9 million in pledges for Puerto Rico\u2019s relief efforts.\n\nThe day after I saw Lopez\u2019s show in Las Vegas, we meet at one of Rodriguez\u2019s latest investments, which he discovered when he was looking for a place to work out in Las Vegas\u2014members of Lopez\u2019s crew had raved about it. Called TruFusion, it offers more than 65 styles of instruction and 35 to 40 daily classes in yoga, Pilates, kettlebell exercises, and battle-rope workouts in heated rooms. Last June, Rodriguez purchased a major stake in the company, and now owns the development rights for all of Florida. President and C.O.O. Jonathan Fornaci says the classes can be so hard that he sees some professional athletes take breaks during them, but \u201cAlex kills it. And immediately afterward he\u2019s drilling down, asking questions that any private-equity analyst would be asking.\u201d I\u2019m warned that the \u201cDown N Dirty Bootcamp\u201d will be hard and sweaty, and it is precisely as advertised. At one point, confused by the welter of instructions\u2014Left! Right! Kettlebell! Weight! Sandbag!\u2014I look over at Lopez and roll my eyes in desperation. \u201cI get confused, too,\u201d she says. \u201cJust watch everyone else.\u201d During some particularly brutal leg lifts, I give up. She does not. In fact, she starts singing. At the end, we\u2019re all sitting on our mats, drenched in sweat and exhausted. Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u201d\u2019 is playing. Living the Dream\n\nIt\u2019s clear as day that neither of them is hitting Pause. After Vegas, she\u2019s off to New York, where her children are in school, and he\u2019s off to Atlanta, where he\u2019s filming a pilot for a CNBC reality show that will help retired athletes who are struggling financially. Rodriguez says he keeps himself grounded with some key words: \u201cGratitude and appreciation. When someone offers me a job, I thank the Lord that I have work, and I beg for more work.\u201d And he adds, \u201cWe\u2019re really good at reminding each other.\u201d They begin to tell me a story, one in which Lopez is in the bath, and Rodriguez is sitting by the fire in a robe. Looking at my face, he starts laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Where are you going with this story, and is it going to get R-rated?\u2019 \u201d But it\u2019s not R-rated, not at all. He says he got hot from the fire and went to sit on the patio outside their room, with a book and his feet up, in the crisp air. Lopez breaks in. \u201cI came out and said, \u2018What are you doing out here?\u2019 He said, \u2018Living the dream.\u2019 \u201d LUCKY IN LOVE\n\nShe wears his Yankee number, 13, during her Las Vegas shows. Photograph by Mario Testino. It\u2019s clear from the story that he said it in a way that was free of irony. \u201cI thought, Wow, this person is different,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cBecause a lot of people I\u2019ve met in my life, they don\u2019t appreciate what they\u2019re doing and how amazing it is . . . not the greatness of the house, but the moment of sitting there with someone you love, with a family, with healthy kids.\u201d All over the house are pictures of their four children as one family; when I ask Rodriguez which of his businesses he\u2019s most passionate about, he responds, without missing a beat, \u201cMy daughters.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639616ff751cf425ef2c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d02b85f1af02cd7ed69ff29/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Duncan-hunter.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d25fc105438e40008b3be3e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lion-king-premiere.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d4/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d138fcb83fd0e000985e67e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-lead-a-rod-kiley.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639525b7a40d71fd1638/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d00d2faef4f5d685d3a408e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Tibi%2520RS18%25200909.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f363955ba52f25246815cd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d1653747b45b600093c819f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Louis-Vuitton-X-Fairground-ss01.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d164c675f741a0008ed05d0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/louis-vuitton-new-art-bags.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f36396ddf784604d17e8eb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d03a3b276711f0f057fe6b1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/euphoria-review-hbo.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e5225b7a40d71fd1688/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d05048028d8add457470b77/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-stonewall-pride.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss02.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Erin Vanderhoof", "Britt Hennemuth", "Ryma Chikhoune", "Paul Chi", "Bethany Mclea", "Mario Testin", "Jessica Dieh", "Kevin Fitzpatrick", "Tina Nguyen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-cover-story", "title": "J-Rod!
