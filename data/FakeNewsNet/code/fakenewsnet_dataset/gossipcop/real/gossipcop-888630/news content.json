A source claimed to the Mail that Presley\u2019s decision was inspired by daughter Lisa Marie Presley\u2019s own long-rumored exit from Scientology. (Lisa Marie has never commented on the subject.)\n\nPresley is just one of many celebrities who belong to the controversial religion, including The Handmaid\u2019s Tale actress Elisabeth Moss, as well as Tom Cruise and John Travolta.\n\nIn recent years, Scientology has been brought even further into the spotlight following Kevin Can Wait star Leah Remini\u2019s public split from the church after over three decades. Remini has since repeatedly spoken out against Scientology, and now helms an Emmy award-winning A&E series about her and others\u2019 experiences with the church.\n\nImage zoom John Sciulli/Getty Images for Politicon\n\nRELATED: Leah Remini Opens up to PEOPLE About Leaving Scientology: \u2018It\u2019s Like a Rebirth\u2019\n\nThe actress has frequently claimed that Scientology officials are controlling and intimidating toward members, and has accused the church of abuse and sexual misconduct. She\u2019s also detailed on numerous occasions claims that the church encourages families to \u201cdisconnect\u201d from relatives who choose to leave Scientology.\n\nRemini previously told PEOPLE this year the process of adjusting to a life outside Scientology \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen overnight\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s a learning process; it\u2019s changing the way you think.\u201d\n\nThe church has denied all those claims, saying in a recent statement to PEOPLE of Remini, \u201cHer whole anti-Scientology shtick was scripted and choreographed by her, casting herself in her drama as the \u2018victim\u2019 so she could cash in on her false narrative while savaging her friends and those who helped her most of her life.\u201d (Read the church\u2019s full statement here.)\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Leah Remini Opens Up to PEOPLE About Leaving Scientology\n\nStill, Remini refuses to back down. She told PEOPLE, \u201cI would like to be the face of resistance to abuse.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250",
