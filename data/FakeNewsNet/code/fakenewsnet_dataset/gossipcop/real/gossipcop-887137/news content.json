They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want.\"\n\nDespite her concession that it shouldn't be the duty of women \"to police our own behavior,\" the suggestion that her strategies would be helpful in staving off sexual predators enraged many people on social media, including Gabrielle Union, Emily Ratajkowski and Patricia Arquette, who all posted that dressing conservatively is not effective; many also accused Bialik of victim-blaming.\n\nReminder. I got raped at work at a Payless shoe store. I had on a long tunic & leggings so miss me w/ \"dress modestly\" shit. \u2014 Gabrielle Union (@itsgabrielleu) October 15, 2017\n\n.@missmayim I have to say I was dressed non provocatively at 12 walking home from school when men masturbated at me. It's not the clothes. \u2014 Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) October 14, 2017\n\nSo @missmayim \"advice\" is: I was never pretty & never tried to be & ladies, take note if you don't want to be harassed?

Karan has since apologized multiple times for her comments.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Bialik wrote that critics of the piece had \"taken my words out of the context of the Hollywood machine and twisted them to imply that God forbid I would blame a woman for her assault.\"\n\nBeing told my @NYTimes piece resonated w/ so many. Also see some have taken my words out of the context of the Hollywood machine.
