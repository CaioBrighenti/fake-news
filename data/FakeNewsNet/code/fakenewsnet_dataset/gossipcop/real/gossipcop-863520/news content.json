In an interview with Vanity Fair, she said she learned she was pregnant just before the Australian Open, which she won.\n\n\u201cIf you would have told me last year in October or November that I would have a baby, not be pregnant but have a baby, I would have thought you were the biggest liar in the world,\u201d Williams told Vanity Fair.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of how I am right now. This is happening sooner than later, and it\u2019s going by so fast.\u201d\n\nShe is having the baby with her fiance, the Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The article accompanying the Vanity Fair photo tells the story of their relationship.\n\nSerena Williams (@serenawilliams) Check out my Vanity Fair Cover. Question- what do u guys think boy or girl?

was having a boy or girl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting to find out but would love to hear your thoughts,\u201d she said.\n\nThe cover was released the same day John McEnroe said he would not apologize for saying Williams would be ranked around No 700 in the world if she played in the men\u2019s game.\n\nWilliams told McEnroe to \u201crespect me and my privacy as I\u2019m trying to have a baby\u201d.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Serena+Williams%2CUS+press+and+publishing%2CMagazines%2CMedia%2CUS+sports%2CSport%2CUS+news",
