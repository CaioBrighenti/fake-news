Taking over the duties carried out last time around by Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, and Tom Brady are three women who are as talented as they are glamorous: Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace.\n\nThe big question, of course, is what will they wear? While we count down to the big night\u2014May 7, 2018\u2014we look back at each woman\u2019s personal Met Gala history searching for clues.\n\nAmal Clooney\n\nMet Gala Debut: 2015\n\nGalas Attended: 1\n\nClooney made a stunning party-of-the-year debut in a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal gown by John Galliano. Its deep red color was presumably a nod to the exhibition\u2019s theme, \u201cChina: Through the Looking Glass,\u201d but this dress was an homage to the wearer. Strapless with a corset-like top, its skirt flared slightly in a cascade of tiers creating the narrow, figure-flattering silhouette Clooney prefers.\n\nAdvertisement 1 / 7\n\nRihanna\n\nMet Gala Debut: 2007\n\nGalas Attended: 7\n\nGala Performances: 2\n\nRihanna is a Met Gala all-star: No one gets more into the spirit of things than @badgalriri. Consider the yolk-color Guo Pei gown she wore to the 2015 event that not only put the Chinese designer on the map, but also blew up the memosphere. For anyone other than Rihanna, that look would have been a tough one to top, but she managed, arriving at this year\u2019s Comme des Gar\u00e7ons exhibition in a fresh-off-the-runway look by the woman of the hour, Rei Kawakubo. By now, we know to expect the unexpected from Rihanna\u2014even an impromptu performance, like the one she gave with Kanye West in 2009.\n\nAdvertisement 1 / 16\n\nDonatella Versace\n\nMet Gala Debut (on record): 1995\n\nGalas Attended: 16\n\nIn 1997, the Costume Institute remembered Gianni Versace\u2019s life and work with an exhibition. This year, to mark the 20th anniversary of her brother\u2019s death, Donatella Versace presented a tribute collection to her brother for Spring 2018. Next May, she\u2019ll cohost the gala that she used to attend by his side. While we know what Donatella will wear\u2014one of her own glamorous creations, cierto\u2014precisely which A-listers will form her entourage remains to be seen.\n\nWatch a History of the Met Gala in 60 Seconds:", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a022363d65b7368a6687af8/16:9/pass/00-social-met-hosts.jpg", "https://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a022363d65b7368a6687af8/16:9/pass/00-social-met-hosts.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laird Borrelli-Persson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/met-gala-2018-hosts-amal-clooney-rihanna-donatella-versace", "title": "Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace to Host 2018 Met Gala", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/met-gala-2018-hosts-amal-clooney-rihanna-donatella-versace", "title": "Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace to Host 2018 Met Gala", "description": "The Met Gala 2018 hosts have officially been announced.
