He\u2019s home with the kids, picking the boys up from school and really allowing me to be able to have the time and freedom to do all this. He\u2019s been really supportive.\u201d\n\nThe slower pace of life is a huge change for Cutler, 35, who up until 2017 had a nonstop football career. On the first season of Very Cavallari, the couple \u2014 who are parents to sons Camden, 6, and Jaxon, 4, and daughter Saylor, 3 \u2014 often joked about the athlete\u2019s excess of free time.\n\n\u201cI call him my farmhand because he\u2019s been planting trees around the house. He\u2019s been taking care of all the animals,\u201d says Cavallari, who recently moved with her family into a new home in the Tennessee countryside. \u201cI\u2019m just giving him time. I\u2019m not gonna pressure him. He worked his ass off for so many years, so I get that all he\u2019s ever known is football. He\u2019s gonna figure it out.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Todd Williamson/Getty\n\nRELATED: Kristin Cavallari Explains Why She Keeps Her Money Separate from Jay Cutler\u2019s\n\nThe former Dolphins quarterback quickly became a fan favorite on Very Cavallari thanks to his dry humor, and Cavallari says he\u2019s now fully embraced his new role.\n\n\u201cComing from the football world where people didn\u2019t get his personality, it\u2019s been really nice for me and him [to have fans] appreciate him and see the real side of Jay,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s been having fun with the show. Now that he sees he had a really positive reaction, he\u2019s been having a good time with it.\u201d\n\nThough they often reference their three kids on the show, the couple choose to keep their children away from the spotlight \u2014 though they know exactly what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cWe try to limit the time we shoot at home, and the boys are at school and Saylor takes a three-hour nap every day, but when they are home they love watching the monitors,\u201d she says.\n\nRELATED: Kristin Cavallari Reminisces About When She and Jay Cutler Started Dating: \u2018He Has No Game!\u2019\n\nImage zoom Kristin Cavallari Courtesy Uncommon James\n\nUsually filming four days a week, Cavallari says shooting the show has been easier than expected. \u201cThe Hills was a breeze \u2019cause we filmed three days a week, and it was three scenes and very regimented,\u201d she says about her former MTV home. \u201cThis isn\u2019t bad either. It\u2019s nice for me because I\u2019m killing two birds with one stone. It\u2019s about my company and these are my real employees. I go into the office and handle business, and there happens to be cameras there.\u201d\n\nThe reality star recently launched Little James, a baby-focused spin-off of her brand Uncommon James, and Cavallari says she\u2019s excited to outfit her friend\u2019s children \u2014 including the Hills castmates like Heidi Pratt and Audrina Patridge.\n\nHer own kids are the fit models for the line, and \u201cI really asked for their opinion,\u201d adds Cavallari. \u201cThe great thing about them is they\u2019re very opinionated \u2026 but they\u2019re good sports about everything.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kristin Cavallari Reveals the Only Two Laguna Beach Alums She Follows on Instagram\n\nWhen the reboot of The Hills airs next year, Cavallari says she\u2019ll definitely be watching. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s really sad I can\u2019t be part of the show, but Heidi and I have joked that maybe we could swap an episode.\u201d\n\nOne of the most beloved \u201cvillains\u201d in reality show history, Cavallari is excited to just kick back this time and soak up everyone else\u2019s drama. Says the star: \u201cI\u2019m curious. Who\u2019s the villain? I want to see it all! I did it for too many years.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kristin-cavallari1.jpg",
