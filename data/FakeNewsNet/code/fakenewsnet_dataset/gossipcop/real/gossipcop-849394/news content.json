Online, comes after a tough four-part reunion, in which she admitted to spreading inflammatory accusations to Porsha Williams that said Kandi Burruss and her husband Todd Tucker had planned on drugging Williams and their mutual friend Shamea Morton in order to take advantage of them sexually.\n\nWilliams had come under fire for repeating the accusations throughout the season because she believed the claims had come directly from Burruss. Problem was, Parks had only heard the information from a still-unnamed source.\n\n\u201cI repeated it because I heard it,\u201d Parks said in the final episode of the reunion. \u201cSomething was brought to me. I repeated what someone told me \u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have repeated it \u2026 I screwed up \u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Phaedra Parks, Porsha Williams, Shere\u00e9 Whitfield and Shamea Morton Annette Brown/Bravo/NBC\n\nMany had wondered how Parks might be able to return to the show next season, with most of the cast accusing her of being a liar.\n\nParks previously told PEOPLE that if offered, she\u2019d still want to come back to the show.\n\n\u201cI would love to continue,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously the show documents your journey, and every journey has its ups and downs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always accurate, of course,\u201d she added. \u201cBut for the moments that they capture something that\u2019s real \u2014 like being a mom, helping someone out, having a very sensitive moment on television that turns into something beautiful \u2014 that\u2019s the legacy that counts when it comes to reality TV. The moments that change people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nReps for both Parks and Bravo had no comment on next season\u2019s casting.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Andy Cohen\u2019s Pick for the Most Absurd Real Housewives Business Ever\n\nParks joined RHOA during it\u2019s third season, and quickly became beloved by fans for her Southern Belle charm and her hilarious one-liners.\n\nOver her six seasons on the show, the reality star let fans into some of the most intimate moments of her life \u2014 from the birth of her two sons (Ayden, 6, and Dylan, 3) to the downfall of her marriage to estranged husband Apollo Nida (who is currently serving an eight-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to bank fraud and identity theft in May 2014, the same year they split).\n\nFilming for the Real Housewives of Atlanta\u2018s landmark 10th season is expected to begin in Georgia soon.", "images":
