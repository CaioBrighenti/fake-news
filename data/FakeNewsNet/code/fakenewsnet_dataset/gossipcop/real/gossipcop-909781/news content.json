This marks Sheeran's second career win in the category.\n\nThe other nominees in the category were Kelly Clarkson's \"Love So Soft,\" Kesha's \"Praying,\" Lady Gaga's \"Million Reasons,\" and P!nk's \"What About Us.\"\n\nSheeran was unable to attend the 60th GRAMMYs due to schedule conflicts, so the award was accepted on his behalf. His win for \"Shape Of You,\" along with his additional win for Best Pop Vocal Album for Divide, at the 60th GRAMMYs brings his career GRAMMY total to four.\n\nAlong with charting No. 1 on the pop songs charts in 44 countries, \"Shape Of You\" held the distinction of taking the No. 1 slot for all of 2017 on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart. Sheeran told Nick Grimshaw on the U.K.'s Radio 1 Breakfast Show that he'd originally written the song with the intention of handing it off to Rihanna, but changed his mind after realizing it was unlikely that she'd sing lines referencing her listening to \"Van The Man [Van Morrison] on the jukebox.\"\n\nFull Winners List: 60th GRAMMY Awards", "images":
