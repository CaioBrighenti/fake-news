In fact, the 23-year-old nanny already got closure from Luyendyk, 36, himself.\n\n\u201cI just got the opportunity to talk with him a week later at his hotel in L.A. and it was filmed and everything but it didn\u2019t make the cut,\u201d the California native perviously told Entertainment Tonight of the reunion. \u201cWe were just able to talk for 30 or 45 minutes and just kind of hash out our relationship and what happened.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the race car driver sent the model packing on episode 7 before selecting his final four women for hometown dates. She was placed on a three-on-one date with contestants Kendall Long and Tia Booth, who both received roses during the day.\n\nMartinez recently sat down exclusively with Us Weekly to rehash the breakup and revealed that she never imagined her young age would become her storyline.\n\n\u201cI had to talk about my age a lot on the show and I kind of figured this might be a big narrative, but I didn\u2019t realize how big,\u201d she explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know my age wasn\u2019t going to be shown until I saw the cast list.\u201d\n\nMartinez also opened up about her heartbreaking elimination. \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t [see it coming] just because I thought that we were at such a good place,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish we had gotten more time to explore our relationship with each other and I wish he had gotten to know me other constantly asking me and grilling me if I was ready \u2026 I think there\u2019s no better way to find out how ready a person is for marriage by just getting to know them rather than continually asking if they are.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rebekah-arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rebekah-arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rebekah-arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bachelors-bekah-martinez-i-saw-arie-after-my-elimination/", "title": "Bachelor\u2019s Bekah Martinez: I Saw Arie After My Elimination", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Bachelor\u2019 contestant Bekah Martinez revealed that she saw ex Arie Luyendyk Jr. after he sent her home \u2014 see more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bachelor\u2019s Bekah M: I Saw Arie After My Elimination", "description": "\u2018Bachelor\u2019 contestant Bekah Martinez revealed that she saw ex Arie Luyendyk Jr. after he sent her home \u2014 see more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bachelors-bekah-martinez-i-saw-arie-after-my-elimination/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rebekah-arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rebekah-arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Beckah M. and Arie on The Bachelor"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelor", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-20T21:18:24+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Bachelor\u2019 contestant Bekah Martinez revealed that she saw ex Arie Luyendyk Jr. after he sent her home \u2014 see more", "title": "Bachelor\u2019s Bekah M: I Saw Arie After My Elimination", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rebekah-arie-the-bachelor.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519161504.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
