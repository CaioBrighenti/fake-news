Abel took the stage in the wee hours of April 14 for those on the East Coast, so we\u2019re breaking the performance down here in case you weren\u2019t able to watch the live stream.\n\nThe talented singer opened his set with two of his most recognizable tunes, \u201cPray For Me\u201d and the ultra popular \u201cStarboy.\u201d When he got to \u201cCall Out My Name\u201d in the latter part of his performance, after calling this audience beautiful and expressing his appreciation for them. As soon as he started belting out the lyrics to the emotional tune, it definitely looked like his sweat had a combination of tears to go along with it. Could he have been thinking about his former love Selena while singing lines like, \u201cWe found each other, I helped you out of a broken place\u201d? It\u2019s definitely possible! After all, The Weeknd\u2019s known for expressing his emotions through his songs and we love him for it! Nevertheless, between crooning away at his popular hits and letting his guard down in his heartfelt performance of his new tune, we\u2019d say that The Weeknd\u2019s first headlining appearance at Coachella was a major success.\n\nThe Weeknd dropped the emotional video for \u201cCall Out My Name\u201d on April 12, sending fans into a frenzy. One summed it up nicely: \u201cEvery time that man releases anything , I am in shambles for weeks lmao.\u201d And after Coachella, Abel will continue hitting the festival circuit, with headlining gigs at Panorama NYC, Outside Lands Music & Arts Festival, Lollapalooza Berlin and more.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9, Eminem, Cardi B, SZA, Tyler the Creator, Migos, King Krule, Vince Staples, St. Vincent, HAIM, Fleet Foxes, David Byrne and tons more of your favorite artists will be taking the stage at Coachella this weekend, so keep tuning into the live stream in order to not miss a moment!", "images":
