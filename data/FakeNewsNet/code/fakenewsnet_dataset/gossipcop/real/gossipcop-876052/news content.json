They pointed toward a scene where Taylor's wearing a black leotard and standing flanked by male backup dancers in a mansion, which they compared to a scene from Beyonc\u00e9's \"Formation\" video, Buzzfeed reports.\n\nJoseph Kahn, the director of the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video, responded to the accusations in a tweet on Friday. \"I\u2019ve worked with Beyonc\u00e9 a few times. She\u2019s an amazing person. The #LWYMMDvideo is not in her art space. Love and respect to Bey,\" he wrote. Kahn's likely referring to his work with Destiny Child on their \"Say My Name\" and \"Jumpin\u2019 Jumpin\" videos. He's also directed a number of other Taylor Swift videos, including the one for \"Bad Blood,\" Just Jared Jr. reports.\n\nThe entire \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video will premiere Sunday at the VMAs. Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 haven't commented on the comparisons.", "images": ["https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d178b6b8a91350008600631/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/hero.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d10d1cae410371c59994dd2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5cfe81cdc546b6b65ab1ff7d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-jojo-siwa.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d1ce69a9660b600092b1a86/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Organza_Story.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2da98e4a35a2393d11225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-social.png"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2da98e4a35a2393d11225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-social.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Bianca Nieves", "De Elizabeth", "Gianluca Russo", "Lauren Rearick", "Suzannah Weis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-beyonce-comparisons", "title": "Taylor Swift Video Director Responds to Accusations of Copying Beyonc\u00e9", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "After Taylor Swift dropped a teaser for her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video, people accused her of ripping off Beyonc\u00e9.", "keywords": "Taylor Swift,beyonce,beyonc\u00e9", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "\"Love and respect to Bey.\"", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2da98e4a35a2393d11225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-social.png", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "The &quot;Look What You Made Me Do&quot; Video's Director Responded to Accusations of Copying Beyonc\u00e9", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-beyonce-comparisons"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"Love and respect to Bey.\"", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59a2da98e4a35a2393d11225/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-social.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "The &quot;Look What You Made Me Do&quot; Video's Director Responded to Accusations of Copying Beyonc\u00e9"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311, "admins": 108943}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
