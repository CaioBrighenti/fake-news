The Hanson boys weren\u2019t confident in their abilities, though, noting that they don\u2019t listen to a lot of \u201cmodern\u201d music. That became evident as the game progressed, with the brothers failing to recognize Justin Bieber\u2019s remix of the song \u201cDespacito.\u201d When they discovered that Bieber was involved with the track, one of the Hansons admitted that he was \u201cglad\u201d that he couldn\u2019t recognize it, adding, \u201cI prefer not to get any venereal diseases so whenever Justin Bieber gets near me or near my ears\u2026it\u2019s just ear infections, they\u2019re terrible.\u201d They later referred to this phenomenon as \u201cchlamydia of the year\u201d and noted that \u201cit sucks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopefully, Justin Bieber will fire back with some kind of a mean burn of his own, at which point all of these cute boys can finally jump into a full-blown feud.", "images": ["https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=5zq9nmk&ct=0:ngtk7da&fmt=3", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--kLKfYUa1--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/ydjpqkedclcjtkzwudz8.jpg", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--1DD-1oGh--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/c4seq6zbcl8zelfeiowq.jpg", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/activity;dc_iu=/4246/DFP_Audience_Pixel;dc_seg=22540930;blog=avnews;ord=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6770184&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7RYaiW2B--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/c4seq6zbcl8zelfeiowq.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--1DD-1oGh--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/c4seq6zbcl8zelfeiowq.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Barsanti"], "canonical_link": "https://news.avclub.com/hanson-brothers-compare-justin-bieber-s-music-to-chlamy-1798263124", "title": "Hanson brothers compare Justin Bieber\u2019s music to chlamydia", "meta_data": {"dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-edd40da2ae92de7cb0979025edd33027.css", "google-site-verification": "P13oAn8o8LB6FVCJWKsHWXvxfbR-SJrmvox6EgULpUs", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7zdLcgzi--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/yfomencyqsnsfvqlfhnt.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2rAgV5LF--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/yfomencyqsnsfvqlfhnt.png", "keywords": "Music, Justin Bieber, Hanson, Newswire, News", "news_keywords": "Music, Justin Bieber, Hanson, Newswire, News", "twitter": {"url": "https://news.avclub.com/hanson-brothers-compare-justin-bieber-s-music-to-chlamy-1798263124", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--1DD-1oGh--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/c4seq6zbcl8zelfeiowq.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@AV_Newswire", "title": "Hanson brothers compare Justin Bieber\u2019s music to chlamydia", "description": "Becoming a big star in any field at a young age can usually screw somebody up, but for the Hanson boys, it seems like the success of \u201cMMMBop\u201d 25 years ago just made them very particular about music.
