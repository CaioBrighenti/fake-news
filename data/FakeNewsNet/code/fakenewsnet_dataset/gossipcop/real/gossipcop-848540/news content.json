Goldman and Wray will each be working individually with novelist and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d creator George R. R. Martin.\n\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d executive producers and showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff will be attached to the four projects, as will Martin, but will not write on any of them.\n\nA spinoff to \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 the most watched series in HBO history \u2014 has been a source of speculation for years. In recent months, HBO executive began to privately acknowledge that the network was searching for writers to develop ideas based on the series and Martin\u2019s best-selling fantasy novels from which it is adapted.\n\nAsked about a possible spinoff last year at the Television Critics Association summer press tour, HBO programming president Casey Bloys said, \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it. It\u2019s something I\u2019m not opposed to. But, of course, it has to make sense creatively. I am not sure that the guys [Weiss and Benioff] can really wrap their heads around it when they\u2019re just about to start production. It\u2019s a pretty intense production. They\u2019re about to start production soon, but I\u2019m open to it. The guys weren\u2019t opposed to it, but there is no concrete plans, or anything like that at this point.\u201d\n\nSeason 7 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is set to premiere July 16. Production on the show pushed the premiere of the new season past its usual April start date, in order to capture the weather the producers wanted. The new season will consist of seven episodes. The eighth and final season, which Weiss and Benioff have already begun writing, will be between six and eight episodes.\n\nThe Season 6 finale of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d drew a series-high 8.9 million viewers in overnight numbers \u2014an especially high number given premium HBO\u2019s much smaller viewer base than broadcast and basic-cable nets. Season 6 averaged 23.3 million multiplatform viewers, according to the service.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hbo-chernobyl.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
