Manafort, who served as Trump\u2019s campaign manager, and his top aide Richard W. Gates III have been accused of 12 counts of fraud, conspiracy and money laundering.", "images": ["https://www.latimes.com/resizer/sIdFz15Dxq6bC6w21Oue6B7_PRk=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-532b8d53/turbine/la-et-mg-paul-walker-daughter-tyrese-gibson-fa-001/", "https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/lat_icons/app-bar-logo.svg?v=36", "https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/tinygif.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/sIdFz15Dxq6bC6w21Oue6B7_PRk=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-532b8d53/turbine/la-et-mg-paul-walker-daughter-tyrese-gibson-fa-001/", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christie D'Zurilla", "Dan Rather"], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-paul-walker-porsche-settles-1508940377-htmlstory.html", "title": "Paul Walker's daughter settles with Porsche in wrongful-death suit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "language": "English (United States), en-US", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2018 Los Angeles Times", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "date": "2017-10-25T16:46:00Z", "googlebot-news": "index", "twitter": {"title": "Paul Walker's daughter settles with Porsche in wrongful-death suit", "image": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/sIdFz15Dxq6bC6w21Oue6B7_PRk=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-532b8d53/turbine/la-et-mg-paul-walker-daughter-tyrese-gibson-fa-001/", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@latimes", "creator": "@latimes"}, "fb_title": "Paul Walker's daughter settles with Porsche in wrongful-death suit", "og": {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-paul-walker-porsche-settles-1508940377-htmlstory.html", "title": "Paul Walker's daughter settles with Porsche in wrongful-death suit", "image": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/sIdFz15Dxq6bC6w21Oue6B7_PRk=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-532b8d53/turbine/la-et-mg-paul-walker-daughter-tyrese-gibson-fa-001/", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "latimes.com", "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "tag": "la-et-entertainment-news-updates-october-2017, Movies, Celebrity", "section": "Entertainment"}, "fb": {"app_id": 119932621434123, "page_id": 5863113009}, "author": "Christie D'Zurilla", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkidLIKTSUWMQJA2XKF2QKQLWILHHY", "ptype": "s"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbXO52kWT9g?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.latimes.com", "summary": ""}
