During a Thursday matinee performance of his play \u201cKiller Joe\u201d on London\u2019s West End, the actor stopped the show twice to tell an audience member to put away her iPad.\n\nLondon theater critic Mark Shenton tweeted an \u201ceye-witness account\u201d from the play, documenting Bloom\u2019s unscripted outbursts, in which he threatened to stall the show if the iPad remained in sight.\n\n\u201cI need you to put [that] iPad away now!\u201d Shenton quoted Bloom as saying, before reportedly adding minutes later, \u201cPut that f\u2014ing iPad away now and I will wait.\u201d\n\nEye-witness account from today\u2019s matinee of @KillerJoePlay: #OrlandoBloom made two unscripted interventions: \u201cI need YOU to put iPad AWAY NOW!\u201d Then again a few mins later: \u201cPUT that fucking IPad away now and I will wait\u201d. pic.twitter.com/WZ4ybgKexJ \u2014 Mark Shenton (@ShentonStage) July 26, 2018\n\nAnother audience member, actor Harry Edwin, replied to Shenton\u2019s tweet to defend the iPad owner, behind whom he was sitting during the incident.
