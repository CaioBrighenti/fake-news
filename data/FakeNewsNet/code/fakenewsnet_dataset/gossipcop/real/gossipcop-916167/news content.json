The father of six \u2014 who shares sons Sean Preston, 13, and Jayden James, 12, with the pop star \u2014 claimed he is currently earning $3,000 a month and receives $20,000 ($10,000 per son) each month from Spears in child support.\n\nFederline claimed in the documents that Spears \u201cearns in excess of $34,000,000 per year.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Britney Spears Pays Kevin Federline $20,000 a Month in Child Support \u2014 and Lawyer Says He\u2019s Requesting \u2018Three Times\u2019 More\n\n\u201cWe think the reasonable needs for the children while they would be in Kevin\u2019s custody is probably three times what he\u2019s currently receiving,\u201d Federline\u2019s attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan told PEOPLE of how much more child support he estimated Spears should pay his client.\n\nA source close to the singer previously told Entertainment Tonight, \u201cKevin wants a raise in money and he can\u2019t account for where the $20,000 is going.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Britney Spears Reveals Son Sean, 12, Plays Football: \u2018I Worry\u2019 \u2014 \u2018He\u2019s Still a Baby to Me\u2019\n\nFederline previously stated in court documents that one of the reasons why he was requesting more money is because he is \u201cno longer able to perform as a dancer due to my age, and I have not been as successful in putting out new music as I was in 2008.\u201d\n\nHe and Spears reached their last official child support agreement in 2007 around the same time the singer\u2019s financial assets were entered into a court-ordered conservatorship managed by her father, Jamie Spears.\n\nSpears and Federline divorced in 2007 after nearly three years of marriage. In 2013 Federline married Victoria Prince, with whom he\u2019s welcomed two daughters, Jordan Kaye, 7, and Peyton Marie, 3. The former rapper and dancer is also dad to daughter Kori Madison, 16, and son Kaleb Michael, 14, with ex-fianc\u00e9e Shar Jackson.", "images":
