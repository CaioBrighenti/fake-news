We\u2019re not sure about you, but when we open our mailboxes and find an invitation to a black tie function, our thoughts immediately turn to what that dress code actually means. Casual wear is out, obviously, but is a cocktail dress going to cut it, or do we need to Rent the Runway?\n\nThat\u2019s why we compiled a guide to black tie formal wear that\u2019ll help you navigate what to wear to a wedding, event, gala, or anything else that calls for black tie attire.\n\nBlack-Tie Formal Wear: What It Actually Means\n\n\n\nBlack tie is a dress code for social functions that start after 6 p.m., and basically translates to \u201cthis party is fancy and men should wear tuxedos.\u201d While the intricacies of black tie formal wear applies more to men than to women, it\u2019s still important to understand that your attire should definitely be appropriate.\n\nGown or No Gown: Do I Have an Option?\n\nApart from white-tie affairs\u2014which aren\u2019t common\u2014black tie is the most formal dress code you\u2019ll probably face when to comes to weddings or galas. For women, it\u2019s customary to wear floor-length gowns, but exceptions can be made.\n\nDon\u2019t own a gown and don\u2019t particularly want to buy one for a one-off occasion? It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to wear a cocktail dress you already have. However, if you do go this route, just make sure to keep the colors rich (black, jewel tones, chic metallics, brown) so as not to look too casual.\n\nConversely, women can wear a floor-length gown in a lighter shade, since the silhouette is inherently dressy. Another acceptable option for black-tie affairs: Chic separates, such as a silk blouse with a full satin skirt.\n\nBlack Tie Optional: What it Means for Women\n\nIf you receive an invite with the term \u201cblack tie optional\u201d know that it mostly applies to men who may or may not own or want to wear a tuxedo. For women, it means you have the option of wearing a full-length gown, or opting for a cocktail dress, so long as the hemline isn\u2019t too short or the style isn\u2019t too revealing.\n\nEssentially, ladies should choose a dress that\u2019ll hold up alongside a room full of men in formal tuxedos, and women who potentially have chosen to wear gowns.\n\nWearing Red to a Formal Affair: What\u2019s the Deal?\n\nThis dated fashion rule was put into place during more conservative times when red was thought to be a way-too-sexy, attention-stealing color. Yes, you might want to stay away from wearing a skin-tight red plunging spandex gown to a wedding or black-tie affair, but you probably don\u2019t want to wear that in any color.\n\nThese days, there are tons of high-style red dresses that are perfectly acceptable as formal wear. Celebrities often wear red gowns that look elegant and classic, as opposed to tawdry.\n\nA good rule of thumb: Choose red gowns that are made from rich silky fabrics like chiffon or organza, as opposed to shiny satin or anything too stretchy, and always keep embellishments to a minimum.\n\nWearing White to a Wedding: Yes or No?\n\nDespite the fact that etiquette books say it\u2019s perfectly fine to wear a white dress to someone else\u2019s wedding so long as it\u2019s not overtly \u201cbridal,\u201d we say proceed with caution. It\u2019s become a pretty big no-no in modern times, and you could run the risk of offending the bride\u2014even if it\u2019s a given that you won\u2019t take away any of her attention. Since every woman under the sun is clued into the fact that wearing white is a don\u2019t, it\u2019ll look like you made a conscious effort to cause some drama.\n\nYour best bet: Save that ethereal white gown for another formal event that\u2019s not a wedding.\n\nCovering Up\n\nSince several formal events take place in colder weather, you\u2019ll need something to keep you warm. However, leave those cardigans, denim jackets and everyday puffers at home and invest in a fur (or faux-fur) jacket or classic overcoat, and a chic shawl or cashmere wrap in case you get chilly inside, or for spring and summer affairs.\n\nAfter-Party Etiquette: Should I Stick With My Formal Wear?\n\nOccasionally, the festivities won\u2019t stop when the clock strikes midnight, as many couples organize after-parties when it\u2019s a hotel wedding. Is it acceptable to change into jeans, or is keeping your formal wear on a must? This really depends on the location of the wedding. For example, if your hotel room is easily accessible, a lot of people do change.\n\nBut if it\u2019s another venue, most people won\u2019t. Feel out the situation to see what others are doing\u2014you certainly don\u2019t want to be the only one in jeans when others are still wearing gowns.\n\nA version of this article was originally published in March 2016.", "images": ["https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/amber-riley.jpg?w=705&h=1024", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/michelle-rodriguez.jpg?w=682&h=1024", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=stylecaster.com&path=%2Fblack-tie-formal-wear%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=225061", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/boden-summer-sale.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/gettyimages-504515534.jpg?w=716&h=1024", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/meghan-markle-5.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/graphic-tee-feature-1.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/blake.jpg?w=1814&h=2424", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1130306277008218&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/perrie-samotin1.jpg?resize=%2C", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/wenn5648037.jpg?w=683&h=1024", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sale-summer-sandals-4.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lion-king-14.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/gettyimages-473922694.jpg?w=752&h=1024", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/zoe-kravitz.jpg"], "top_img": "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/zoe-kravitz.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Perrie Samotin"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/black-tie-formal-wear/", "title": "Black Tie Formal Wear: What It Means, What to Wear, and More", "meta_data": {"description": "We know black tie formal wear means men should wear a tux, but the dress code gets trickier for women.
