He was truly the ultimate wildlife warrior. Dad was amazing because he left this legacy that people will never forget. He didn\u2019t just say to love the cute and cuddly animals \u2013 he tried to get people to understand and respect the animals like crocodiles and snakes and really break down those barriers,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI have a beautiful family at Australia Zoo of staff that takes care of all our gorgeous animals. And I think that my greatest achievement is really having the sweetest and most awesome family,\u201d said Bindi. \u201cI\u2019m really blessed and I count my blessings every single day to have them. for us, it\u2019s nice that we share everything with all of our wildlife work and our traveling work.
