It follows that in July we can bring all our parents together and show them some appreciation all at once. Parents play a vital role in the lives of children. From the day we are born, parents are our protectors, teachers, providers and role models. As families, they are the core of our communities. On National Parents\u2019 Day, we honor all parents do every day to raise up their children in a world that is constantly changing and challenging.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\n\nSpend some time with your parents or visit someone who was like a parent to you. Post on social media using #NationalParentsDay and encourage others to join in.\n\nHISTORY\n\nNational Parents\u2019 Day was established in 1994 when President Bill Clinton signed a Congressional Resolution into Law (36 U.S.C. \u00a7 135) for: recognizing, uplifting, and supporting the role of parents in the rearing of children.\u201d The bill was introduced by Republican Senator Trent Lott.\n\nThere are over 1,500 national days.
