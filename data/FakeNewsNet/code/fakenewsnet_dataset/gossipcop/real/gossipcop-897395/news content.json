{"url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/rosario-dawson-eric-andre-split", "text": "Rosario Dawson and Eric Andre, a pairing so unlikely that Chance the Rapper once demanded photographic proof of their relationship, have reportedly split after more than a year together, multiple outlets confirm. Us Weekly was the first to report the news, citing an unnamed source who said, \"It just ran its course. He was never something serious.\"\n\nThe Eric Andre Show creator and The Defenders actress went public with their relationship on Valentine's Day, when each posted about the other on social media. Dawson posted two photos of her and Andre on Instagram. \"Wishing you all a 'Michael Bolton's Big Sexy Valentine's Day'! #HappyValentinesDay #Valentines\" she captioned one in which they pose with Michael Bolton. \"Happy Valentines Day my love! #MyCuddlyValentine #Valentines\" she wrote alongside the other, in which she and Andre stand in the typical \"prom pose\" next to a koala. The same day, Andre tweeted a selfie of the pair and wrote, \"The undisputed most gorgeous being on the planet \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udf39\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 @rosariodawson I love u bb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe #HappyValentinesDay,\" though the tweet has since been deleted, according to Us Weekly .\n\nThe PDA-filled Valentine's posts didn't convince everyone right away, though. Chance the Rapper apparently assumed it was all part of one of Andre's signature elaborate pranks, and texted Dawson to ask if the relationship was real. In response, Andre posted more photos of the duo in which their tongues were touching. \"I think we have to touch tongues...people think this is a prank,\" the comedian captioned one of the now-deleted tweets, according to USA Today . Chance the Rapper could barely mask his surprise. \"He tweeted this because I text Rosario asking if it was a joke \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \" he tweeted in response to Andre's posts.\n\nA few months later, Dawson appeared on The Late Show and, once again, confirmed the relationship, and shared that she met Andre at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016. She also told host Stephen Colbert that she wished the tongue-touching photos hadn't been necessary to prove their love. \"He started posting more pictures of like our tongues touching and stuff, like personal pictures,\" she said. \"I was like, 'You're still a millennial, man. You don't post the tongue pictures!'\"\n\nIn the same interview, she spoke about how Andre had taken care of her after an emergency surgery she underwent over Labor Day weekend in 2016 for a ruptured ovarian cyst, saying, \"He took care of me in an adult diaper. That's real love.\" In a September 2017 Instagram post , she expressed her gratitude for Andre's support during her surgery and recovery. \"What a difference a year makes...This weekend marks a year that I had to get emergency surgery to stop internal bleeding from a ruptured cyst on my ovary. It was the first time I told @ericfuckingandre that I loved him (and very much not the last),\" she captioned a series of photos of her and Andre in the hospital.", "images":
