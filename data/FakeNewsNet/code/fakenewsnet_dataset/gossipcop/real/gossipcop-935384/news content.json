I\u2019d like to address the TWITTER outrage with this video and image to follow. #directedby @ClayneCrawford,\u201d Wayans tweeted.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox, Warner Bros. TV and Crawford did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn the video, something explodes behind Wayans and the actor is seen ducking with his face twisted in pain as he clutches his head. In the hashtag, Wayans included the episode in which he sustained the injury was directed by Crawford.\n\nNow that the fate of the show is solidified..

It turns out there was a second shooter, to Damon\u2019s left, on the other side of the pillar behind which his character was crouched, which accounts for what he heard from his left side. @claynecrawford #noapology,\u201d Wayans tweeted.\n\nBelow is a rendering seeking to explain yesterday\u2019s incident.

Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.\n\n\u201cIt is true that I have been reprimanded twice during this past season of Lethal Weapon. The first reprimand was because I reacted with anger over working conditions that did not feel safe or conducive to good work under the leadership of a guest director and assistant director who, in turn, were angry at my response. I met with Human Resources, I apologized for my part of the conflict, and I completed studio-appointed therapy. I even shared a sizable portion of my paycheck with one of the parties involved per the instruction of the studio,\u201d Crawford began.\n\nImage zoom Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford FOX via Getty\n\nHe wrote about the second incident that took place on the set of the drama series: \u201cThe second reprimand came during an episode I was directing. An actor on set felt unsafe because a piece of shrapnel from an effect hit him. It was an unfortunate event that happened in spite of all safety precautions and procedures being followed. I take responsibility for the incident because I was in charge of the set.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Damon Wayans, Clayne Crawford Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nThe actor continued by sharing that he has absolute \u201clove, respect and care for my crew and cast, and would never intentionally jeopardize so many jobs. Moreover, I love the process of making film and television. I appreciate and respect the work of everyone involved. It takes a village. I am incredibly sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I apologize to all the crew and cast for any negative attention Lethal Weapon is receiving because of these incidents,\u201d continued Crawford, who said that he takes \u201cgreat pride in treating everyone in life with dignity and kindness.\u201d\n\nWait, wait, wait\u2026\u2026you can\u2019t fire me on my day off! \u2014 Clayne Crawford (@ClayneCrawford) May 8, 2018\n\nLast week, Entertainment Weekly confirmed a report from The Hollywood Reporter that stated Fox and its studio partner Warner Bros. TV were searching for a new actor to play Riggs if the series was renewed for a third season.\n\nCrawford seemingly responded on Twitter Tuesday by first sharing a photo of himself on a boat with his arms up and the caption, \u201cHmmmmmm?\u201d and then tweeting, \u201cWait, wait, wait\u2026\u2026you can\u2019t fire me on my day off!\u201d\n\nSeann William Scott was hired to replace Crawford as Riggs\u2019 brother, according to Variety.", "images":
