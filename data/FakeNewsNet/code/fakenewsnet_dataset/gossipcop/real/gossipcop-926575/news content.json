Dean Unglert has revealed that he is going to therapy following his split from his The Bachelor: Winter Games costar and girlfriend of four months Lesley Murphy.\n\nWhile speaking on his iHeartRadio podcast Help! I Suck at Dating with Dean Unglert on Tuesday, April 10, the Bachelorette alum was asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the one thing that you want out of a relationship going in?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to feel loved,\u201d Unglert answered. \u201cThe worst part about all of this is that Lesley did feel that way about me regardless of everything. I know that she did love me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got the one thing that I wanted but it still didn\u2019t end up working out, which is one of the worst things to come to the realization of,\u201d the podcast host, 26, continued. \u201cI\u2019ve been meditating more and I\u2019m going to start going to therapy this week.\u201d Unglert, who lost his mother at the age of 15 and had a rocky relationship with his father, also admitted that he \u201cneeds to come to terms with a lot of issues.\u201d\n\nThe reality TV personalities fell in love while filming the ABC reality competition series in 2017. In February, Unglert got on one knee during the World Tells All special \u2014 to give Murphy a key to his apartment.\n\nThe former Bachelor star, 30, told Us Weekly at the time, \u201cI think the love blossomed after Winter Games wrapped. I think that was the initial meeting \u2026 Then we took it off camera and that\u2019s where everything really, really took off.\u201d\n\nHowever, news broke that the pair called it quits on April 6. Following news of the break up, Unglert posted a cryptic message about love on Instagram on April 7, writing, \u201cI\u2019ve learned that although everyone DESERVES love, it\u2019s not something we\u2019re entitled to. Love takes work. Love is compromise. Love is earned. I still have a lot of work to do on myself, a lot to prove to myself, before I\u2019m ready for something like that.\u201d\n\nThe travel blogger also shared her own statement via Instagram a day later: \u201cIt\u2019s imperative to find someone who chooses us and acknowledges our many layers, who can be open and vulnerable, and most importantly, who is ready. To meet someone and be met. To be chosen and to choose. To love and to be loved. This is everything. All we need is that same energy reciprocated, and despite how open and loving you attempt to be, people can only meet you as deeply as they\u2019ve met themselves.\u201d\n\nDespite the breakup, the startup recruiter also said on his podcast that he believes Murphy will \u201cbe an incredible wife and wonderful mother,\u201d and added she was \u201can incredible girlfriend.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
