Buzz60\n\nDavid Spade spoke of his sister-in-law, Kate Spade, who died by suicide in June, on \"Good Morning America\" Wednesday, July 18. (Photo: ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nDavid Spade gave an update as to how he and his family are coping following fashion designer Kate Spade's suicide on \"Good Morning America\" Wednesday.\n\nKate was married to Spade's brother, Andy, from 1994 until her death on June 5. The two co-founded the handbag and fashion label Kate Spade New York and share one child, Frances Beatrix Spade, 13.\n\nSpade told \"GMA\" anchor Robin Roberts that his family was doing \u201cas good as we can.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s been very tough, obviously,\" he added. \"She really made an impact.\u201d\n\nThe actor/comedian, on-hand to promote his audio book \"A Polaroid Guy in a Snapchat World\" and his movie \"Father of the Year\" dropping on Netflix July 20, recalled how a run-in with Kate would motivate his companions to dress to the nines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2018cause every girl I was with, or anyone that knew they would see Katie, would dress differently. They would bring their A-game,\" he said. \"It was very sweet.\n\n\"She was such a beautiful, lovely, great spirit...\"\n\n\n\nDavid Spade remembers his late sister-in-law Kate Spade: https://t.co/hOA4cYZxGSpic.twitter.com/NAusA7mobf \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) July 18, 2018\n\n\"They would be like, \u2018Is Katie coming? Are Andy and Katie gonna be there?\u2019\" he continued. \"And if they were, it was a whole new wardrobe.\"\n\nSpade said Kate, being \"very sweet\" and knowing his friends had dressed to impress, would compliment them.\n\n\"And when I\u2019d say, \u2018You don\u2019t dress up for me,\u2019 they\u2019d go, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s her and you\u2019re you,'\" joked Spade.\n\nNoting he could just \"start bawling,\" Spade said of his sister-in-law: \u201cShe was such a beautiful, lovely, great spirit that obviously will be missed.\u201d\n\nDavid Spade with his sister-in-law Kate Spade in 2002.
