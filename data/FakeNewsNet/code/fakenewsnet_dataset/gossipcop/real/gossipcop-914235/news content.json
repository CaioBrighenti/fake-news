Free from his captors, he decides to upgrade and don his armor in order to hunt down weapons that were sold under the table.[17]\n\nIn April 2006, Marvel hired Jon Favreau to direct Iron Man,[5] with the writing teams of Art Marcum and Matt Holloway and Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby writing competing scripts.[5][18] Favreau consolidated both into one script, which was then polished by John August.[6] Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the title role in September 2006, after growing out a goatee and working out to convince the filmmakers he was right for the part.[19] Principal photography began on March 12, 2007,[20] with the first few weeks spent on Stark's captivity in Afghanistan,[21] which was filmed in Inyo County, California.[22] Production also occurred on the former Hughes Company soundstages in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California,[23] with additional filming at Edwards Air Force Base[24] and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.[25] Iron Man premiered at the Greater Union theater in George Street, Sydney, on April 14, 2008,[26] and was released internationally on April 30, and in the United States on May 2.[27][28]\n\nThe film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, who approaches Stark regarding the \"Avenger Initiative\". Favreau said that he included the scene as \"a little tip of the hat for the fans...a way to sort of tee up The Avengers.\" Jackson was only on set for a day, with a skeleton crew to avoid the news of his cameo leaking.[29] Captain America's shield is also visible in the background of a scene; it was added by an ILM artist as a joke, and Favreau decided to leave it in the film.[30]\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (2008)\n\nAfter being exposed to gamma radiation that causes him to transform into the monstrous Hulk, scientist Bruce Banner goes on the run and isolates himself from his love, Betty Ross.

Downey said that the filmmakers \"were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. It happens to be a scene where I basically approach [actor William Hurt's character General Ross], and we may be considering going into some sort of limited partnership together. The great thing is he\u2014and I don't want to give too much away\u2014but he's in disrepair at the time I find him. It was really fun seeing him play this really powerful character who's half in the bag.\"[42] In addition, Captain America is briefly seen frozen in ice in an alternate opening of the film, included in the DVD release.[43]\n\nIron Man 2 (2010)\n\nIron Man and Iron Man 2, helped establish the shared universe concept with his inclusion of Samuel L.

Favreau explained, \"We introduced Captain America's shield briefly in one shot in the last film. So now it really was in his room, so we had to figure out how to deal with the reality that the shield was in his workshop.\"[30] A scene toward the end of Iron Man 2 in a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house contains several Easter eggs, ranging from footage from The Incredible Hulk displayed on a monitor to pointers on a map indicating several locales related to other Marvel films, including one pointing toward a region of Africa in reference to the Black Panther.[57] A young Peter Parker appears as the child wearing an Iron Man mask whom Stark saves from a drone; the appearance was confirmed in June 2017 by Spider-Man actor Tom Holland, Kevin Feige and Spider-Man: Homecoming director Jon Watts.[58][59] The film's post-credits scene showed the discovery of Thor's hammer in a crater.[60]\n\nThor (2011)\n\nThor, crown prince of Asgard, is banished to Earth and stripped of his powers after he reignites a dormant war.

About his role in Thor he stated, \"Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [had] a very kind of small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [chose] to put him more into the universe of it.\"[72] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor.[73] Branagh said that they \"were always going to have a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp\", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role.[74] The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract.[75] The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers.[76] Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.[77]\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (2011)\n\nIn 1942, Steve Rogers is deemed physically unfit to enlist in the U.S. Army and fight the German Reich in World War II.

Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.[398] As promotion ahead of the release of The Avengers, Marvel released an official infographic detailing this timeline in May 2012.[397]\n\nWith Marvel no longer trying to complicate their timeline,[40] the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to The Avengers: Iron Man 3 takes place about six months later, during Christmas;[125][127] Thor: The Dark World is set one year later;[139] and Captain America: The Winter Soldier is two years after.[127] Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man ended the phase in 2015, with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.[202] For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so Captain America: Civil War begins a year after Age of Ultron,[241] with Avengers: Infinity War set two years after that.[340] However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually \"happen on top of each other\" while being less \"interlocked\" as the Phase One films were,[316] with Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming respectively beginning a week and several months after Civil War;[319][291] Thor: Ragnarok beginning four years after The Dark World and two years after Age of Ultron,[314][315] which is set around the same time as Civil War and Homecoming;[316] Doctor Strange taking place over a whole year and ending \"up to date with the rest of the MCU\";[261] Ant-Man and the Wasp also set two years after Civil War and shortly before Infinity War;[349] and both Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel Vol. 2 being explicitly set in 2014,[165][275] which Feige believed would create a four-year gap between Vol. 2 and Infinity War, though the other MCU films up to that point do not specify years onscreen.[399]\n\nWhen Spider-Man: Homecoming was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not line-up, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of Homecoming into the previous films, such as The Avengers.[400] This was labelled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of The Avengers and the events of Civil War, which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed.[292][401] Additionally, dialogue in Civil War indicates that eight years pass between the end of Iron Man and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years.[402][403] Infinity War co-director Joe Russo described the Homecoming eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\",[404] and the mistake was ignored in Infinity War which specified that its events were taking place only six years after The Avengers.[403] The public response to the Homecoming mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,[401] and in November 2018, a timeline specifying dates for the films' events released to that point was included as part of the sourcebook Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years, celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the MCU.[405]\n\nMarvel Studios: The First 10 Years timeline from November 2018[405] Year(s) Feature films 1943\u20131945 Captain America: The First Avenger 2010 Iron Man 2011 Iron Man 2, Thor 2012 The Avengers, Iron Man 3 2013 Thor: The Dark World 2014 Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man 2016 Captain America: Civil War 2016\u20132017 Doctor Strange 2017 Black Panther, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War Notes: The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Ant-Man and the Wasp are discussed in the Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years sourcebook, but their events are not included in the timeline.[405]\n\nThis timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of Black Panther and Infinity War by placing them in 2017. Despite the latter apparent mistakes, Thomas Bacon of Screen Rant described the timeline as \"the closest Marvel has yet come to making an official statement on just when the different MCU events are set\", bringing \"some sense of balance to the MCU continuity\".[406] Following Infinity War, the Russo brothers said future films would not necessarily be set according to real time as there are \"a lot of very inventive ways of where the story can go from here\", with both Ant-Man and the Wasp and Captain Marvel set earlier in the timeline.[407] Avengers: Endgame begins shortly after Infinity War and ends in 2023 after a five year time jump. It confirms dates for several of the other films, including The Avengers in 2012, Thor: The Dark World in 2013, Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, Doctor Strange around 2017, and Ant-Man and the Wasp in 2018 at the same time as Infinity War.[370] Spider-Man: Far From Home begins eight months after Endgame in 2024,[385] contradicting Amy Pascal's prior statement that it would begin only a few minutes after Endgame.[408]\n\nRecurring cast and characters\n\nList indicator(s)\n\nThis section shows characters who will appear or have appeared in multiple film franchises within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and have appeared in the billing block for at least two films (see FAQ).\n\nAn empty, dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film, or that the character's official presence has not yet been confirmed.\n\nV indicates a voice-only role.\n\n^ Norton's only film was The Incredible Hulk in 2008. ^ Iron Man 2, is Peter Parker.[59] In June 2017, Holland, Watts, and Feige stated that the child (played by Max Favreau) whom Tony Stark saves from a drone in, is Peter Parker. ^ Howard's only film was Iron Man in 2008. ^ The Avengers.[451] Damion Poitier portrayed Thanos in the post-credits scene of\n\nRelease\n\nHome media\n\nIn June 2012, Marvel announced a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled\", for release on September 25, 2012.
