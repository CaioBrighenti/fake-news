In a night filled with passionate speeches, star-studded musical performances, a champagne reception and art auction, this charitable gala brought together hundreds of A-listers.

After leaving all of its residents without power, The Global Gift Foundation, an organization committed to fighting poverty, health, education and social injustice, knew it needed to do something to help.\n\nIn response, it teamed up with the charitable organizations of its Honorary Chairs, the Eva Longoria Foundation and Ricky Martin Foundation, to host a star-studded gala that would raise money for a part of the United States that desperately needed our help.\n\nPhoto Credit: ExcslusiveAccess.Net\n\nA cocktail reception kicked off this sold-out event and glasses clinked as Miami\u2019s most beautiful swirled around the Eden Roc Miami Beach Hotel ballroom donning the season\u2019s most striking gowns. A-list guests \u2014 like Serena Williams, Adrienne Bailon, Domingo Zapata and Zuleyka Rivera, to name a few\u2014walked the red carpet and grabbed their seats. The room was filled to the brim with partygoers who indulged under a magical setting of glittering chandeliers, deep purple mood lighting and fairytale-like flowers in blush pinks, reds and corals.\n\nPhoto Credit: ExcslusiveAccess.Net\n\nAs waiters spun around carrying trays of porcini-crusted Angus beef tenderloin, salty caramel chocolate tart and mango coconut panna cotta, guests were treated to surprise musical performances from Ednita Nazario, Adrienne Bailon and Israel Houghton, Oskar Cartaya and Jeimy Osorio.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Mariana Atencio emceed the event, and a live art auction featured pieces by standout artists, including Domingo Zapata and Alexander Mijares. The profits raised by the auction went directly to the victims of Hurricane Maria through The Global Gift Foundation.\n\nPhoto Credit: ExcslusiveAccess.Net\n\nMaking a point to honor those who have been making a difference already, Eva Longoria Bast\u00f3n took a moment to present international recording artist and philanthropist, Miguel Bos\u00e9, with the Global Gift Foundation Humanitarian Award. This award recognizes those individuals \u201cwho have distinguished themselves through exceptional philanthropic service and activism.\u201d\n\nPhoto Credit: ExcslusiveAccess.Net\n\nDemonstrating their commitment to the Puerto Rican people, Eva Longoria Bast\u00f3n and Ricky Martin, longtime advocates for the Latin community, gave passionate speeches about their love for Puerto Rico, first hand accounts about the state of the island in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, and most importantly their dedication to restoring its beauty and spirit.\n\n\u201cI am angry, and I won\u2019t stop talking about it,\u201d said Ricky Martin, Grammy Award-winning singer and founder of the Ricky Martin Foundation. \u201cPuerto Rico is my home, and they need our help.\u201d\n\nHaving raised $50K+ in ticket sales alone during last night\u2019s stunning event, the Global Gift Foundation promises the residents of Puerto Rico one thing for sure: help is on the way.\n\nHaute Living was proud to be the exclusive media partner of this event.", "images": ["https://hauteliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RomanDelgadoWorldRedEye-357x238.jpg",
