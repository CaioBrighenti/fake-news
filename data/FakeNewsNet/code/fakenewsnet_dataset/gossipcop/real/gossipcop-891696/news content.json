Per People, Gloria Fallon passed away at the age of 68 in the hospital after a brief illness, and was able to be around her family and friends until the end. \u201cJimmy Fallon\u2019s mother, Gloria, died peacefully on Saturday,\u201d a Fallon family spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cJimmy was at his mother\u2019s bedside, along with her loved ones, when she passed away at NYU Langone Medical Center in NYC. Our prayers go out to Jimmy and his family as they go through this tough time.\u201d\n\nMy mom and I were talking on the phone for the third time that day and she actually said, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk enough.\u201d #MomQuotes \u2014 jimmy fallon (@jimmyfallon) May 10, 2017\n\nFallon has spoken out numerous times about how he\u2019s extremely close with his mother, even telling us a few years ago that she \u201ccalls him every day with notes\u201d about his performances.
