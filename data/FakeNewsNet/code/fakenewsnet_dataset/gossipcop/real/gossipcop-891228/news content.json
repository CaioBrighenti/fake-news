It was widely believed that Jason Momoa and Lisa \u201cLilakoi\u201d Bonet married in November 2007, but they didn\u2019t make it official until this October, multiple sources confirm exclusively to Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cJason Momoa and Lisa Bonet had an official wedding a few weeks ago at their house in Topanga, California,\u201d one insider reveals. \u201cApparently they weren\u2019t officially married until then! They said they \u2018made it official.'\u201d\n\nA second source confirms to Us that the couple \u2014 who share kids Lola, 10, and Nakoa-Wolf, 8 \u2014 purchased a marriage license from the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk\u2019s office on October 2, one week before they exchanged vows.\n\nBonet\u2019s daughter Zo\u00eb Kravitz, whom she shares with ex-husband Lenny Kravitz, attended the wedding, as did Alicia Vikander, Michael Fassbender, famed rock climber Chris Sharma and several of Momoa\u2019s former costars. \u201cHe stays close with the people he works with on movies and is a really nice guy,\u201d the first source tells Us. \u201cIt was a big party and people came from out of town to attend.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Facebook user who saw a friend\u2019s photos from the wedding, the Game of Thrones alum, 38, wore an unbuttoned white shirt and a lei. He styled his long locks into a man bun. The Cosby Show alum, 49, \u201clooked beautiful,\u201d according to the Facebook user\u2019s pal, who said some of the guests performed a traditional M\u0101ori haka for the bride.\n\nThe couple first met through mutual friends in 2005. Momoa previously revealed that he had a crush on Bonet after watching her on The Cosby Show as a child. \u201cThe first time [we met] I was like, \u2018I want that one. I want her. I\u2019m going to get her,'\u201d he told Katie Couric in 2014. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her until after we had our two children. But I told her \u2026 \u2018I kind of stalked you. I was going to find you.'\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
