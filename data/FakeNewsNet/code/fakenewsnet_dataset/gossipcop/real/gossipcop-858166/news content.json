The \u201cbackyard was decorated with a lot of balloons\u201d and all the \u201cguests had fun making pizza\u201d via a pizza oven Garner rented from Olive Wood Pizza, the source added.\n\nThe guest list, which included Molly Sims and her family, was missing one notable face: Garner\u2019s ex Ben Affleck. Although Garner and the 45-year-old actor, who filed for divorce a year ago, remain on friendly terms, the source told PEOPLE \u201cBen wasn\u2019t there,\u201d even though he was in Los Angeles at the time.\n\n\u201cBen was back in LA this weekend,\u201d the insider explained, adding that \u201cthe whole family went to church on Sunday before Jen\u2019s party.\u201d\n\nThe duo filed to end their 10-year marriage on April 13, 2016, nearly two years after they originally announced their split. The divorce isn\u2019t yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.\n\nImage zoom Gotham/GC Images\n\nRELATED: Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner a Year after Divorce Filing: \u2018Things Are Pretty Good Between Them\u2019\n\nSince then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,\u201d a source close to Affleck told PEOPLE. \u201cThey continue to remain cordial to one another. There is a lot of love and respect there.\u201d\n\nThe day before the holiday, the whole family made a group trip to Sea Life Park in Oahu. \u201cThey made a family trip to interact with dolphins, sea lions and stingrays,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cThey spent several hours at the park and looked like they had the best time. The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.\u201d\n\nDuring the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. \u201cJen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn\u2019t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,\u201d added the source.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

The actress, 45, was smiling ear to ear as she attended an event at the famous French bakery Ladur\u00e9e.\n\nGarner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who\u2019s continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. \u201cAs long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,\u201d another insider said. \u201cShe will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jennifer Garner and Kids Visit Ben Affleck in Hawaii for Easter Weekend\n\nThe actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles.\n\nGarner is also busy working on her fitness. Late last year, the actress shared a video to her Instagram documenting her extreme workout routine, which she dubbed the \u201cRecipe for Turning A Mom Back into Action Lady.\u201d Garner did not specify why she was kicking her fitness up a notch, but perhaps it\u2019s for a starring role in the action film Peppermint, which Deadline describes as \u201cJohn Wick, with a female protagonist.\u201d The movie comes out this fall.\n\nAnd as for work, Garner currently in the midst of shooting her new HBO comedy series Camping, from Girls writers and executive producers Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner. The actress has not starred in a television show since Alias, which wrapped in 2006 after five seasons.\n\nShe recently shared a behind-the-scenes photo of herself and the rest of the cast, jokingly captioning, \u201cLet us commence. \ud83e\udd17 The cast of #CampingHBO before we\u2019re sunburned and covered in ticks.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/garner-12.jpg?crop=0px%2C564px%2C1500px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/64491006_2871762609560687_658577528503689868_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C92px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kimberly-perry.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/abby-lee-miller-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C2236px%2C1173px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cole-swindell-barbie-blank.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-850361860.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2-split-4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/jessica-simpson-2.jpg?crop=97px%2C0px%2C955px%2C501px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/spies.jpg?crop=274px%2C0px%2C2152px%2C1129.8px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/zoe.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/jennifer-garner3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_9084343c_huge.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c1648abf15ab582b95dc580d09b34c5?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ben-affleck-fathers-day-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/aniston.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/obama-wh.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2333px%2C1224.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/gettyimages-955757962.jpg?crop=391px%2C506px%2C3144px%2C1650px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/aniston-1-e1560883462108.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1260px%2C661.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/gettyimages-1057174770.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/ben-affleck-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/jennifer-garner3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-18-at-9.50.02-am.jpg?crop=765px%2C535px%2C1703px%2C894px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-1096270896.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/daisy.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/jennifer-garner3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/jennifer-garner-turns-46-how-shes-enjoying-her-life-after-ben-affleck-split/", "title": "Jennifer Garner Turns 46!
