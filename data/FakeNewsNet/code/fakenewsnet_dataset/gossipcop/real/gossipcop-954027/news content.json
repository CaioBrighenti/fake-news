In the days since we have heard from a few members of the franchise family, including Dave Bautista, Sean Gunn, and Michael Rooker - but two key names we didn't hear from were Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana. Now the two actors have broken their silence and posted mostly vague responses to the news on their respective social media channels: Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\ncinemablend\n\n\n\nEmail It\u2019s been a challenging weekend I\u2019m not gonna lie. I\u2019m pausing myself to take everything in before I speak out of term. I just want everyone to know I love ALL members of my GOTG family. Always will. \u2014 Zoe Saldana (@zoesaldana) July 22, 2018 Without mentioning James Gunn by name, Zoe Saldana took to her personal Twitter account this afternoon to post a message about everything that has been happening. It seems that she is not yet ready to release a full comment on the situation, and instead simply stated that she loves \"ALL members of [the] GOTG family.\" As for Chris Pratt's response to the James Gunn news, his message was even more cryptic. The actor, who saw his entire career change after being cast in Guardians of the Galaxy, chose a Bible verse as his means of communicating his thoughts - notably choosing a quotation from the Epistle of James in the New Testament: \u201cUnderstand this, my dear brothers and sisters. Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.\u201d\n\n\n\nJAMES 1:19\n\n?????? \u2014 chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) July 22, 2018 Dave Bautista also noted in his statement that he would have more to say about this situation - and we can assume that this definitely won't be the last we here on the subject from Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana. There are still some key members of the Guardians of the Galaxy cast who have not yet said anything publicly about James Gunn, including Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan and Pom Klementieff. Because all of them do press interviews throughout the year, we surely will hear something from them at least eventually. Right now, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 very much remains up in the air, with the project lacking a director - and it's unknown if Marvel Studios will still use the screenplay that Gunn has written for the trilogy capper. Production has been scheduled to start up in the early months of 2019, with the plan being to have the film in theaters some time in 2020. Neither Disney nor Marvel has officially commented on the status of the movie, or how/if it will be moving forward - but you can be sure that we will be keeping an eye out for updates, so stay tuned here on CinemaBlend.
