But after almost every appearance, be it on-screen or on-stage, something about the star seems to surface as a topic of conversation (aside from her killer style): Kelly's weight.\n\nThe singer has a history of promoting body positivity, and she always stuns regardless of her size. The American Idol alum shared how she lost weight at the 2018 CMT Awards and during an interview on Today.\n\n\"I'm not working out!\" the star admitted in a red carpet interview with Extra. \"I think people think I'm working out and I'm like, 'Don't think I'm going to come play some sport!'\"\n\n\n\nKelly really has lost weight recently\u201437 pounds to be exact. So if not by exercise, then how?\n\nThe Plant Paradox amazon.com $29.99 $17.48 (42% off) Shop Now\n\n\"I had an autoimmune disease and a thyroid problem that started in 2006,\" Clarkson explained to Hoda Kotb, referencing her fluctuating weight. \"I read this book, it's called The Plant Paradox [by Steven R. Gundry, MD], and it might not work for you but it worked wonders for me.\" Previously, Kelly had credited her glam squad and Spanx for her slim figure.\n\n\"I'm, like, 37 pounds lighter,\" she said. Still, even with her new look, Clarkson is staying true to her body-positive attitude. \"For me, it wasn't really [about] the weight\u2014for me it was that I'm not on my medicine anymore.\"\n\nAs she told the Daily Mail in 2017: \"Too skinny, too fat, too blonde\u2014so much blah. This is who I am and I'm happy. Happy looks different on everyone.\"", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kelly-clarkson-weight-loss-1556747018.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.731xh;0,0.0257xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1528476603-51ko3WI1thL.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/brandon-blackstock-and-honoree-kelly-clarkson-attend-news-photo-883394202-1554391590.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.662xh;0,0.0423xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kelly-clarkson-reba-mcentire-1523566608.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0600xh&resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kelly-clarkson-weight-loss-1556747018.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.731xh;0,0.0257xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taysha Murtaugh", "Lifestyle Editor", "Taysha Murtaugh Is The Lifestyle Editor At Countryliving.Com", "Where She Covers Everything Home Decor", "Crafts To Country Music"], "canonical_link": "https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a21238036/kelly-clarkson-weight-loss-secret/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Gets Candid About Her 37-Pound Weight Loss Journey", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Country Living", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Gets Candid About Her 37-Pound Weight Loss Journey", "description": "The singer credits her incredible weight loss journey to one powerful book.", "url": "https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a21238036/kelly-clarkson-weight-loss-secret/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kelly-clarkson-weight-loss-1556747018.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.731xh;0,0.0257xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 165119423553230, "pages": 12013348247}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CountryLiving", "modified_time": "2019-05-01 10:29:36", "published_time": "2019-05-01 10:23:00", "section": "Entertainment"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CountryLiving", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kelly-clarkson-weight-loss-1556747018.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.731xh;0,0.0257xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "y2umrM2fg1eXvnoHVUyHzeVTDYfhwLzq_rWVXkg0Yhw", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Reveals Secret to 37-Pound Weight Loss - Kelly Clarkson's Diet, 'The Plant Paradox'", "description": "Kelly Clarkson finally addressed her recent weight loss, crediting it to a clean diet outlined in the book 'The Plant Paradox', and no exercise.
