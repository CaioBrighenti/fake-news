Nine months after Cena asked for Bella's hand at WrestleMania 33, the WWE stars celebrated their engagement at a January 13 bash.\n\nThe details of the event were kept pretty mum, though guest and brow artist Olivia Wingen told E! News that the bash was equally sporty and delicious. \"It was a beautiful day, great food, lots of football, and some amazing announcements for [E! show] Total Bellas,\" she said.\n\nNot to mention, some amazing fashion! Take a peek at some of the immaculately turned-out guests:\n\nCena was still glowing the day after the party. The pro wrestler took to Twitter to share how \"meaningful\" the event had been, and to declare his love for his future bride.\n\nSuch a wonderful, meaningful, emotional day yesterday with the woman of my dreams and both of our families. I love you Nicole, you\u2019ve made me realize the importance of togetherness. \u2014 John Cena (@JohnCena) January 14, 2018\n\nBella tweeted right back, still reveling in the \"magical\" evening.\n\nAww my Love... It was so magical. Love you too John. \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/QJAtxBRJjy \u2014 Nikki & Brie (@BellaTwins) January 14, 2018\n\nThese lovebirds clearly can't wait to make it official. After six years together, they seem more in love \u2014 and more adorably gushy \u2014 than ever. And both athletes are excited for the cake tastings on the near horizon.\n\nCena recently told E!: \"[Wedding planning is] actually going to gear up in the next few weeks. It's kind of a special time where there is a little bit of [a] lull and I'm really looking forward to spending some time with Nicole and work on that. Hopefully, in the next few weeks the wedding planning is really going to amp up!\"", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/327/663/190703_3983178_Is_Craig_Conover_Really_Over_Naomie_Olindo_.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/briana-ryan-culberson-grocery-shopping.jpg?itok=QiQLmgVL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/1021/703/190709_3985566_Andy_Cohen_Reacts_to_Lisa_Vanderpump_s_Absen.jpg?itok=lNfk2wvQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=8qj_CxiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/barbara-luann-rhony.jpg?itok=lOYMeBeH", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/southern-charm-cameran-eubanks.jpg?itok=RYE6blsx", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/dish-111618-john-cena-nikki-bella.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/rhop-904-candiace-dinner-party-explosion_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/755/619/190627_3980046_Sonja_Morgan_on_Ramona_Singer___She_s_Very_H.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=sLRmUfZw", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/below-deck-med-403-joao-cries-over-brooke_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/captain-sandy.jpg?itok=qXjF-_oI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/dorinda-luann-friendship.jpg?itok=_aGuNqe_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/225/655/190710_3986181_What_You_Didn_t_See_Ashley_Jacobs_Do_at_the_.jpg?itok=6y25G9ie", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/08/dish-082217-drew-scott-nikki-bella.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/cynthia-kenya-kandi.jpg?itok=b8xgPLPA", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/148/263/190625_3978632_Dorit_Kemsley_on_Camille_Grammer_s_Accusatio.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/dorit-kemsley-morgan-stewart-look-alikes_0.jpg?itok=uElmmY9J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2017/08/dish-082917-john-cena-nikki-bella.jpg?itok=VH5NJsKp", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/10/dish-101217-john-cena-daniel-bryan.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/dish-111618-john-cena-nikki-bella.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenny Berg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/john-cena-and-nikki-bella-have-engagement-party", "title": "John Cena and Nikki Bella Celebrated Their Engagement With a \"Magical\" Bash", "meta_data": {"title": "John Cena and Nikki Bella Had an Engagement Party | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "Nikki Bella and John Cena haven't announced a wedding date yet, but it's never too early to party.
