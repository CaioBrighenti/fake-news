Our client is fully cooperating with authorities on that investigation,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cHe expects to be completely vindicated once the investigation is concluded. He sends his best regards to his fans and his fellow castmates.\u201d\n\nAnd while the rest of the cast agreed that Ravenel\u2019s absence from the reunion was appropriate given the situation, his ex Kathryn Dennis declined to comment for the sake of their two children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment until it\u2019s resolved,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I am going to focus on is just the children and staying out of it.\u201d\n\nThe former couple shares Kensie, 4, and Saint, 2\u00bd.\n\nImage zoom Thomas Ravenel and Kathryn Dennis Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to spend more time together in front of the children,\u201d she said. \u201cSo things are moving in the right direction the best as they can.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina police are investigating allegations of sexual assault brought against Ravenel by \u201cnanny Dawn,\u201d who was featured on the show caring for their kids.\n\nAdditionally, real estate agent Ashley Perkins has alleged that Ravenel assaulted her mom Debbie Holloway Perkins after meeting him on Tinder in October 2015 and going on a last-minute first date.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Southern Charm\u2019s Thomas Ravenel Accused of Sexual Assault, Allegedly Paid Accuser $200,000\n\nRavenel has denied the accusations.
