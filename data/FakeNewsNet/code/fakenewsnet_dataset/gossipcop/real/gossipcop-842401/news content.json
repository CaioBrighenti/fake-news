The 45-year-old actor recently revealed that the Cake actress, 48, can only take his beard for so long before she asks him to get rid of it. See what he had to say in the video above!\n\nTheroux opened up about his new facial hair during a Monday, April 10, appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. \u201cI\u2019ve had the beard back. I grew it back for The Leftovers season 3,\u201d he told the talk show host. \u201cAnd I\u2019m kind of growing it back again. I like it now.\u201d\n\nAsked if Aniston is a fan, the Girl on the Train star replied, \u201cShe likes it up to a point. Like, she\u2019ll like it for about a month and then she\u2019ll be like, \u2018OK, you have to get rid of it.\u2019 And then I\u2019m like, \u2018No. I have to actually keep the beard now for the whole show. I can\u2019t shave it off.\u2019\u201d\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\u2019s Matching Couple Style\n\nThough she may not always be down with his woolly face, Theroux told DeGeneres that his bushier beard is at least a step up from the stubble \u2014 which he agreed felt like \u201csandpaper\u201d \u2014 that he had to sport for season 1 of The Leftovers. \u201cThe first season, I had to have stubble for the entire season and that was torture for her,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd torture for me too. And now it\u2019s soft.\u201d\n\nDuring his chat on the daytime program, Theroux \u2014 who married Aniston in a private August 2015 ceremony at their L.A. home \u2014 also shared what he and the Friends alum did for her birthday back in February. \u201cWe went to Cabo San Lucas and sat in the sun,\u201d the hunky star said. \u201cAnd we had a little party. We threw a little party and we had a pi\u00f1ata and I gave her some gifts and that was about it. Low-key. \u2026 It was fabulous.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
