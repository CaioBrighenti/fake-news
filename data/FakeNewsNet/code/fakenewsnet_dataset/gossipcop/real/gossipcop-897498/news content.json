Featuring Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2018s Jesse Williams proposing with a huge diamond, the clip transports viewers to a picturesque wedding day with happy guests. One problem: This is a tense relationship defined by fights, jealousy, and deep insecurities. Nope, there are no happy endings here. Right before \u201cI do,\u201d Williams takes off his wedding ring and walks back down the aisle.\n\nNaturally, Lovatics are loving the emotional video from director Mark Pellington. On Twitter, Lovato called it one of her \u201cfavorite videos yet\u2026\u201d Watch the video above, and read reactions below\n\nthe tell me you love me music video is so good. it\u2019s seriously one of the best music videos i\u2019ve seen in a while. \u2014 \u064b (@explicitlyag) December 1, 2017\n\nTell Me You Love Me is Demi\u2019s BEST video, she did what she had to do.. the visuals, the story, the ACTING!!! It has nothing to do with her others videos. Congratulations, Miss @ddlovato #DemisWeddingToday \u2014 Ian \ud83e\udd8e (@demilovtimes) December 1, 2017\n\nthinking about it, Tell Me You Love Me could've been an excellent visual album
