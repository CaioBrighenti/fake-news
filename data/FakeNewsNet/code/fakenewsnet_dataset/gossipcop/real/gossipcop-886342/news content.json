As allegations of sexual misconduct continue to mount, the disgraced film producer\u2019s wife, Georgina Chapman, announced on Tuesday, October 10, that she is leaving him after 10 years of marriage.\n\nNow, the 61-year-old is opening up about the \u201cpain\u201d he caused the British fashion designer, 41, and their two children India, 7, and Dashiell, 4.\n\nCelebrity Splits of 2017\n\n\u201cI sat down with my wife Georgina, who I love more than anything, and we discussed what was best for our family,\u201d he told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe discussed the possibility of a separation and I encouraged her to do what was in her heart. In the end, she made the decision to separate. I understand, I love her and I love our children and hopefully, when I am better, I will be in their lives again. I support her decision, I am in counseling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild.\u201d\n\nAfter the New York Times uncovered allegations that Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades, the movie mogul gave an interview with the New York Post saying that Chapman was supporting him.\n\n\u201cShe stands 100 percent behind me,\u201d he told the paper on October 5. \u201cGeorgina and i have talked about this at length. We went out with [Weinstein\u2019s former advisor] Lisa Bloom last night when we knew the article was coming out. Georgina will be with Lisa and others kicking my ass to be a better human being and to apologize to people for my bad behavior, to say I\u2019m sorry, and to absolutely mean it.\u201d\n\nThe split comes less than a week after the New York Times\u2019 shocking expose. Ashley Judd spoke to the paper for the story and detailed an encounter in Weinstein\u2019s hotel room where he greeted her in a bathrobe for what she thought was a business meeting and asked her to give him a massage. The Times also revealed that several women, including actress Rose McGowan, had been paid out by The Weinstein Company in settlements over sexual harassment allegations.\n\nSince then, several other victims have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie.\n\nWeinstein is now seeking treatment for sex addiction. He has three daughters \u2014 Emma, Lily and Ruth \u2014 from his previous marriage.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
