The Oscar-nominated track, which first appeared in the rapper\u2019s film, 8 Mile, has been covered by everyone from Michael Phelps to Daisy Ridley, and, more a decade later, it\u2019s still going strong. Now, the real Slim Shady himself is paying tribute to one of the track\u2019s most famous, meme-inspiring lyrics \u2014 \u201cmom\u2019s spaghetti\u201d \u2014 with a pop-up shop that actually serves the famous dish!\n\nTo celebrate the release of his ninth studio album, Revival, the Detroit native has returned to his hometown to open a weekend-long pop-up shop at local music venue The Shelter. The mini shop, which is open from 10am to 5pm today and noon to 5pm tomorrow, is selling all kinds of exclusive merch, but there\u2019s also food up for grabs.\n\nDetroit!

Come vomit up some spaghetti with me this weekend at our official #Revival pop up. Exclusive merch, spaghetti and more,\u201d he joked, referencing the viral line from the song\u2019s first verse.\n\nOn hand for the opening, Marshall Mathers met with fans and signed autographs as hungry shoppers indulged in the hearty lunch they\u2019d been hearing about for 15 years. Apparently, it didn\u2019t disappoint, with Instagrammer Stephen Caladiao proclaiming it \u201csome of the best spaghetti and meatballs I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nPrepared underneath a pink neon sign, the treat is being served up in a cute branded box stamped with a heart and the words \u201cMom\u2019s Spaghetti,\u201d and comes with a side order of good ol\u2019 grilled cheese.\n\nAnyone else feeling hungry right about now?\n\nWould you like to try Eminem\u2019s infamous mom\u2019s spaghetti?
