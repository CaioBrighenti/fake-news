He is best known for his role as Brian O'Conner in The Fast and the Furious franchise.\n\nWalker began his career as a child actor in the 1970s and 1980s, but first gained recognition in the early 1990s after featuring in the television soap opera The Young and the Restless. He soon transitioned into film, and received praise in 1999 for his performances in the teen films She's All That and Varsity Blues, which helped kickstart his career. Walker then gained international fame after starring in The Fast and the Furious.\n\nHe subsequently gained commercial success in a number of other action and thriller films, enjoying critical praise for his performances in Joy Ride (2001), Into the Blue (2005), and Running Scared (2006).

Walker's father and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against Porsche, which resulted in settlements. At the time of his death, Walker had not completed filming Furious 7 (2015), so it was delayed for rewrites. The song \"See You Again\", performed by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth, was commissioned for the Furious 7 soundtrack as a tribute to Walker.[7]\n\nEarly life\n\nWalker was born in Glendale, California, the son of Cheryl (n\u00e9e Crabtree), a fashion model, and Paul William Walker III, a sewer contractor and boxer who was a two-time Golden Gloves champion.[8][9][10] Paul's paternal grandfather had a boxing career as \"'Irish' Billy Walker\".

He had a supporting role in Clint Eastwood's adaptation of Flags of Our Fathers (2006).\n\nWalker at a convention in February 2006\n\nWalker then starred in the crime thriller Running Scared and Walt Disney Pictures' Eight Below, both released in 2006. Eight Below garnered critical-acclaim and opened in first place at the box office, grossing over US$20 million during its first weekend.[16] During the filming of Running Scared, director Wayne Kramer stated that \"[Walker] is that guy on some level\"[17] when comparing Walker with his character in the movie, Joey Gazelle. Kramer continued on to say that he \"loved working with [Walker] because as a director he's completely supportive of my vision of what the film is. And even better, he's completely game for it.\"[17]\n\nWalker starred in the independent film The Lazarus Project, which was released on DVD on October 21, 2008.

At the time of his death, Walker was dating Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell.[26] They had been dating since she was 16 and he was 33. Walker was raised in a Mormon household, but later became a non-denominational Christian.[27]\n\nHe held a brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Ricardo \"Franjinha\" Miller at Paragon Jiu-Jitsu[28] and was awarded his black belt by Miller posthumously.[29]\n\nWalker had an interest in marine biology, and joined the board of directors of The Billfish Foundation in 2006.[30] He fulfilled a lifelong dream by starring in a National Geographic Channel series Expedition Great White (later retitled Shark Men), which premiered in June 2010.[31][32] He spent 11 days as part of the crew, catching and tagging seven great white sharks off the coast of Mexico. The expedition, led by Chris Fischer, founder and CEO of Fischer Productions, along with Captain Brett McBride and Dr. Michael Domeier of the Marine Conservation Science Institute, took measurements, gathered DNA samples, and fastened real-time satellite tags to the great white sharks. This allowed Dr. Domeier to study migratory patterns, especially those associated with mating and birthing, over a five-year period.[33]\n\nIn March 2010, Walker went to Constituci\u00f3n, Chile to offer his help and support to the people injured in the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck on February 27. He flew with his humanitarian aid team, Reach Out Worldwide, to Haiti to lend a helping hand to the 2010 Haiti earthquake victims.[34]\n\nA car enthusiast, he competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series in which he raced on the AE Performance Team driving a BMW E92 M3. His car was sponsored by Etnies, Brembo Brakes, \u00d6hlins, Volk, OS Giken, Hankook, Gintani, and Reach Out Worldwide.[35] Walker had been preparing for an auto show prior to his death.[36] Walker also had a large car collection of about 30 cars, a portion of which he co-owned along with Roger Rodas.[37] The collection included (but is not limited to):[38]\n\nRoger Rodas became Walker's financial adviser[42] in 2007 and helped to establish Reach Out Worldwide.[43] Rodas, a pro-am racer[44] was the CEO of Always Evolving, a Valencia high-end vehicle performance shop owned by Walker.[45] Walker was also a close friend of his 2 Fast 2 Furious co-star Tyrese Gibson.[46] Vin Diesel considered Walker to be like a brother, both on and off screen, and affectionately called him \"Pablo\".[47] Walker's mother referred to her son as Diesel's \"other half\".[48]\n\nDeath\n\nSite of Walker's death on Hercules Street in Santa Clarita (photo taken 2015)\n\nOn November 30, 2013 at around 3:30 p.m. PST, Walker and Roger Rodas, 38, left an event for Walker's charity Reach Out Worldwide for victims of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda),[49] with Rodas driving[50] his Porsche Carrera GT. In a 45 mph (72 km/h) speed zone on Hercules Street near Kelly Johnson Parkway in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California, the car crashed into a concrete lamp post and two trees and burst into flames.[49][51] Rodas died of multiple trauma while Walker died from the combined effects of trauma and burns. Both of their bodies were burned beyond recognition.[50]\n\nThe curve where Walker and Rodas were killed is a popular spot for drifting cars.[52] No alcohol or other drugs were found in either man's system,[53] and neither mechanical failure nor road conditions appeared to play a role.[54] Police found no evidence of drag racing.[55] The investigation concluded that the car's speed \u2013 between 80 mph (130 km/h) and 93 mph (150 km/h) \u2013 and age of the tires were the primary reasons for the crash.[56]\n\nGrave of Paul Walker at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills\n\nWith Furious 7 in the middle of filming at the time of Walker's death, Universal announced an indeterminate hiatus on the production, citing a desire to speak with his family before determining what to do with the film.[57]\n\nNumerous friends and movie stars posted tributes to Walker on social media.[58] His body was cremated and his ashes were buried in a non-denominational ceremony at Forest Lawn Memorial Park.[59] His life was later chronicled in the documentary I Am Paul Walker, which was released on August 11, 2018.[60]\n\nLegal repercussions\n\nIn December 2014, Walker's father, Paul III, filed a wrongful death claim against Rodas's estate seeking the return of, or \"a proportionate share\" of revenue generated by a group of automobiles that were jointly owned by both Walker and Rodas.[61]\n\nIn September 2015, Walker's daughter Meadow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Porsche for the death of her father, claiming that the Porsche Carrera GT had numerous design defects including a history of instability, and that its seat belt placement can cause harm upon impact.[62] Porsche's response denied any wrongdoing and blamed Walker himself, stating: \"The perils, risk, and danger were open and obvious and known to him, and he chose to conduct himself in a manner so as to expose himself to such perils, dangers, and risks, thus assuming all the risks involved in using the vehicle.\"[63] In April 2016, U.S. District Court Judge Philip S. Gutierrez ruled in favor of Porsche in a separate lawsuit filed by Roger Rodas' widow, Kristine.[64][65] The ruling had no bearing on two other cases against Porsche which have been filed by Walker's father, who is also the executor of the actor's estate, and his daughter.[65] Walker's father and daughter both reached an agreement with Porsche.[66]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nMusic videos\n\nAwards and nominations", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Nissan_Skyline_-_2_Fast_2_Furious.JPG/220px-Nissan_Skyline_-_2_Fast_2_Furious.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Herculesstreet.jpg/220px-Herculesstreet.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Paul_Walker.jpg/170px-Paul_Walker.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Fast_Five_Cast_2.jpg/250px-Fast_Five_Cast_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg/220px-PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Steady2.svg/11px-Steady2.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Grave_of_Paul_Walker.JPG/170px-Grave_of_Paul_Walker.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Paul_Walker_Signature.svg/150px-Paul_Walker_Signature.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Walker", "title": "Paul Walker", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.34.0-wmf.13", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/PaulWalkerEdit-1.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
