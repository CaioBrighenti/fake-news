Miller also took $120,000 worth of Australian currency into the United States without reporting it, to which she also pleaded guilty in 2016.\n\nAfter her initial jail time, she faces two years of supervised probation. She was additionally fined US$40,000 and ordered to pay back the US$120,000.\n\nProsecutors said she tried to cheat her creditors by hiding US$775,000 worth of income and deserved to spend time in prison. Miller\u2019s lawyers argued for probation, saying her creditors were made whole after the fraud was discovered.\n\nAccording to the prosecutors, Miller hid the money in secret bank accounts. With the US$120,000, she split the money up into separate bags and had friends carry them in their luggage in the summer of 2014. (By law, all travellers carrying in excess of US$10,000 must declare it at customs. Miller failed to do so.)\n\nREAD MORE: Abby Lee Miller of \u2018Dance Moms\u2019 is going to jail\n\nMiller took to Instagram last December to share that she passed her real estate
