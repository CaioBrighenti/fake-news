Ever the goofball, Derek couldn't resist photobombing the couple's first big public moment following their stunning Idaho nuptials in July, and the results are epic.\n\nWith Laich dressed in a classic black tux and Julianne sporting a strapless champagne gown, the newlyweds posed happily for the cameras ahead of the two-day event. Derek, who was nominated for Outstanding Choreography for Dancing with the Stars, let the duo get a few cute snaps in before he jumped in front of them with his mouth agape and flashing two thumbs up. Behind him, the couple couldn't help but laugh.\n\nImage zoom Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nIt's no secret that Derek, 32, approves highly of Laich. Shortly after the couple's wedding, he referred to the NHL star as a \"great guy,\" who brings out the best in his sister.\n\nVIDEO: Julianne Hough and Brooks Laich Make Their First Public Appearance Post-Wedding\n\n\"I said to him, 'I've known Julianne my entire life. I've seen every phase she's gone through.' I've seen all the different versions of herself trying to figure out who she is and by far this is the best version of her and it's because of him,\" Derek told E! News.\n\nRELATED: Derek Hough Says Sister Julianne Is the Best Version of Herself with Husband Brooks Laich\n\nWe don't know about you, but we're looking forward to more years of goofy photobombs from this adorable family.", "images": ["https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/1505126712/091117-brooks-Laich-Julianne-and-derek-Hough.jpg?itok=JAcSVvgi",
