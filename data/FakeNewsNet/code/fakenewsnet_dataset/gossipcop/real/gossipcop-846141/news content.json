Depp has responded to a lawsuit filed by his ex-managers who say its his fault for losing millions. File Photo by Jim Ruymen/UPI | License Photo\n\nApril 27 (UPI) -- Johnny Depp fired back at his former managers who say in a new lawsuit that the actor is at fault for being $40 million in debt due to his extravagant spending.\n\n\"Why didn't they drop me as a client if I was so out of control?\" the Pirates of the Caribbean star said of The Management Group when speaking with the Wall Street Journal about the lawsuit.\n\n\"I've worked very, very hard for a lot of years and trusted a lot of people, some who've clearly let me down,\" he said.\n\nDepp sued the Los Angeles-based firm run by brothers Joel Mandel and Rob Mandel for $25 million in January for fraud, negligence, for failing to file his taxes on time and for taking out high-interest loans on his behalf.\n\nIn their countersuit, TMG stated through their attorney Michael Kump that Depp \"lived an ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.\"\n\n\"Depp, and Depp alone, is fully responsible for any financial turmoil he finds himself in today,\" the complaint continues.\n\nThe 53-year-old says TMG lied about certain aspects of his lifestyle in their suit including information regarding his 14 residences, the $18 million he paid for a yacht, the $30,000 spent on wine every month and how they said he paid $3 million to have the ashes of author Hunter Thompson blasted from a cannon over Aspen, Colo.\n\nDepp noted that the cannon actually cost $5 million. \"It's my money,\" he said. \"If I want to buy 15,000 cotton balls a day, it's my thing.\"\n\n\"We look forward to responding to Mr. Depp's latest falsehoods in our amended pleadings,\" David Shane, spokesman for TMG said Tuesday. The company is seeking $560,000 in unpaid fees and a ruling that states Depp is responsible for his current debt, E!
