Alongside the smooch picture, Hudson revealed how her friendship with Fujikawa became so much more.\n\nHudson explained that she and Fujikawa first crossed paths because of her friendship with his stepsisters. However, she was \u201cenormously pregnant\u201d with her 13-year-old son Ryder with ex-husband Chris Robinson at their earliest encounter.\n\n\u201cA year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date,\u201d she captioned the post. \u201cNo moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move!\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nThe star added, \u201cAnd as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter. So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it\u2019s been truly incredible!\u201d\n\nHudson concluded the post wishing a happy first date anniversary to her \u201cbaby,\u201d adding the hashtags \u201c#LoveThisMan\u201d and \u201c#WhatAYear.\u201d\n\nSealed With a Kiss! Kate Hudson & Boyfriend Danny Fujikawa Make Their Couple Debut at Snatched Premiere\n\nHudson and Fujikawa made their red carpet debut as a couple in May while attending the premiere of Hudson\u2019s mother\u2019s movie Snatched in Westwood, California.\n\nRomance rumors first started after the pair were spotted kissing during an L.A. lunch date in March.\n\nSince then, the couple has been spotted all over the world. From going for a night out in N.Y.C. to celebrating Hudson\u2019s birthday together in L.A. to Cambodia, where the couple took a trip together in June.\n\nImage zoom J. Countess/WireImage\n\nHudson was previously married to The Black Crowes singer Robinson for six years. She was also previously engaged to Muse frontman Matt Bellamy, with whom she shares 7-year-old son Bingham. They were engaged for four years before calling it quits in 2014.\n\nIt appears Fujikawa fits right into Hudson\u2019s hipster lifestyle. \u201cKate\u2019s a free spirit who has always been attracted to musicians,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE. \u201cBut Danny also appeals to her because he is talented, bright and cosmopolitan like she is.\u201d", "images":
