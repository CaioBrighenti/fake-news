But if this is him entering the final stage of his Westeros death plan, we\u2019re left asking what he would have done if Daenerys hadn\u2019t turned up beyond the Wall with Viserion in the first place.\n\nOf course, the Wall coming down is a major event that has felt like a narrative inevitability since the ancient, 700 foot-high behemoth was first introduced. And it now being breached (if not completely felled) serves - along with the confirmation of Jon\u2019s true lineage and claim to the Iron Throne - feels like the official signal Game of Thrones is entering its final act. Plainly, the Wall had to fall otherwise the story\u2019s conclusion lacks its essential part.\n\nAs such, theorising how it may happen and allow the armies of the dead to go from Wildling-bothering pest to immediate, mortal-coil threatening certainty has been one of the biggest debates in Thrones fandom over the past few seasons. Prior to Season 7, the expectation was that Bran\u2019s mark - given to him by the Night King during a vision of his forces - would remove the magic placed on the structure by the Children of the Forest (the Wall's origins are the stuff of myth, but it\u2019s assumed to be a shared effort of the Westerosi natives and the first men). The Night King attacking Bran already allowed him to break into the original Three-Eyed Raven\u2019s Children-protected hideout and kill him; surely passing through the Wall would do something similar?\n\nWhen he and Meera arrived at Castle Black at the start of the season, however, it didn\u2019t have much of an impact - the Wall\u2019s remained standing under the watchful eye of Dolores Edd all season with minimal worry. It took the Night King finding a presumed-extinct creature, turning it and riding it to destruction to even create a hole, which is possibly the luckiest move in the entire series.\n\nWhat Would The Night King Have Done Without The Dragon?\n\nAs the Night King uses the dragon he got just over an hour of TV time before to bring down the Wall, are we to assume he had no other way through? The fact he\u2019s been traipsing around just north of the Wall for years (Hardhome isn\u2019t relatively that far out from Eastwatch) would definitely suggest his advancement was being halted.\n\nIf so, then that would mean had Dany never flown north then he\u2019d be stuck twiddling his thumbs, raising the straggling Wildlings for little long-term gain, only hoping for a breakthrough; it was only when the three dragons came over the ridge that an option presented itself and he acted ridiculously quick. That\u2019s an incredibly convenient plot turn in a show once built on methodical storytelling as is, but as it\u2019s the biggest development for the central unstoppable evil force vastly reduces the primary antagonists\u2019 threat; they are only deadly due to the heroes\u2019 failures.\n\nThere is an argument to be made the show is making a point of how man\u2019s fear of death inadvertently only accelerates the inevitability\u2019s advancement, but there was nothing in the show that tries to put blame on Jon, Dany and co.\u2019s short-sightedness (beyond Tyrion\u2019s berating, something that is much more politically focused).\n\nThe Night Knight may have had another, more time-consuming trick up his sleeve - he is immortal, presumably, so waiting isn't a big problem for his dead army - meaning the dragon simply accelerated plans. Although, as there's no evidence of it, that begins making assumptions on the villain\u2019s plans, and leading us onto an interesting track.\n\n1 2\n\nBest Contenders To Be The Next James Bond", "images": ["https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tg-logo-full-white.fc9e742a.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/sr-logo-full-white.b0cc2b44.svg", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/91f52889f6a04390a65ad2591c59986e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/th-logo-full-white.7684e614.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/hc-logo-full-white.5f66cfe4.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tr-logo-full-white.090c581a.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-white.fe72c74c.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-white.642d3d01.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-white.04a6f0d4.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/cb-logo-full-white.afca2e29.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-white.8242bbb9.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tq-logo-full-white.7436bde3.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=297467373958238&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/ts-logo-full-white.54beb4cf.svg", "https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Night-King-Takes-Down-Viserion-in-Game-of-Thrones.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Night-King-Takes-Down-Viserion-in-Game-of-Thrones.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hannah Shaw-Williams", "Kara Hedash", "John Orquiola", "Padraig Cotter"], "canonical_link": "https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-night-king-plan-before-dragon-wall-destroyed/", "title": "Game of Thrones: Was the Dragon Always the Night King's Plan?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Game of Thrones' big villain is taking advantage of the show's dragons - but what was the Night King going to do before they turned up?", "og": {"title": "Game of Thrones: Was the Dragon Always the Night King's Plan?", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-Night-King-Takes-Down-Viserion-in-Game-of-Thrones.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}, "url": "https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-night-king-plan-before-dragon-wall-destroyed/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "What was he doing before Dany turned up?", "site_name": "ScreenRant"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-29T10:08:27Z", "section": "SR Originals"}, "fb": {"app_id": 822150531210883, "pages": 10765693196}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504001307.0, "source": "https://screenrant.com", "summary": ""}
