He told stories, honoured old friends and finished by leading the band in a set, first using his mouth to scat in place of a missing horn section and then taking a turn at the drums.\n\nCosby, handing the drumsticks off to the 11-year-old son of the bass player, asked if the boy knew who he was and then told him.\n\n\"I used to be a comedian,\" Cosby deadpanned.\n\nCosby reminisced about his childhood, telling the crowd about how when he was 4 he grilled a relative about the impending birth of his brother.", "images":
