With not one but two performances of her greatest hits and a Billboard Icon Award acceptance speech, she wowed the audience.\n\n\u201cI think luck has so much to do with my success. I think it was mostly luck with a little bit of something thrown in,\u201d Cher said as her son Chaz Bono watched from the audience.\n\nCher joins an esteemed list of past award recipients, including Celine Dion, Prince, Jennifer Lopez, Stevie Wonder and Neil Diamond. With more than 100 million albums sold worldwide and a No. 1 single in every decade from the 1960s to the 2010s (she was the first artist to have a No. 1 single on a Billboard chart in each decade), Cher has certainly earned the honor of icon.\n\nGwen Stefani presented Cher with the award, saying:\n\n\u201cIt is an honor for me to be here tonight to present the Billboard Icon Award to a woman who is truly the definition of the word icon: Cher. From the first note you know it\u2019s her. Her artistry, her commitment to her craft and her willingness to take on new creative challenges have served as an inspiration to me and my career and she continues to inspire. She has proven that there is nothing she can not do. Cher is trailblazer, a fashion trendsetter, truly iconic looks at every single point in her career, a role model for preservering and showing us how to be strong and how to be true to ourselves. She is a cultural influencer, a tireless activist and an incredible humanitarian who cares about our world and speaks out against injustices.\u201d\n\nNext, Cher performed her hits \u201cBelieve\u201d and \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time\u201d that were electrifying and got the audience on their feet. For \u201cBelieve,\u201d she donned a bleach blonde wig, barely-there dress made of glittery silver strands accented by heart-shaped pasties and silver boots.\n\nCher also busted out a huge black curly wig, black leather jacket, thigh-high boots and sparkling black bodysuit for a performance of her 1989 smash \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time.\u201d\n\nAfter performing her hits, she accepted the Billboard Icon Award with a humble speech that notably left out any mention of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve wanted to do what I do since I was four years-old. And I\u2019ve been doing it for 53 years. That is not an applause thing, I\u2019m 71 yesterday. And I can do a five-minute plank, okay? Just saying. I want to thank my mom. Because when I was really young she said, \u2018You\u2019re not going to be the smartest, you\u2019re not going to be the prettiest, you\u2019re not going to be the most talented, but you\u2019re going to be special.\u2019 And when I met Sonny he said the same thing. There was really nothing about me that led anyone to believe that I was going to be special.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re more special than you know! And happy birthday, Cher!\n\nWatch Cher perform at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards:", "images": ["https://hornet.com/assets/images/icons/chat.svg", "https://storiescdn.hornet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/22084335/cher-billboard-1000x500.jpg", "https://hornet.com/assets/images/icons/stories_fill.svg", "https://hornet.com/assets/images/icons/hornet_share_icon.svg", "https://hornet.com/assets/images/icons/discover.svg", "https://unicornbooty.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-686530764-1495421754-640x428.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=T2/Qp1hNdI20fn", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-AbQ3d-g_WcVnk.gif", "https://d2dc5pqqtzsz5o.cloudfront.net/assets/images/header_logo-535cc4ef82c594c0080b1ab2b6c03375.png", "https://hornet.com/assets/images/icons/home.svg", "https://unicornbooty.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cher-EthanMiller-800x533.jpg", "https://hornet.com/assets/images/icons/write_for_us.svg"], "top_img": "https://storiescdn.hornet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/22084335/cher-billboard-1000x500.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hornet Networks"], "canonical_link": "https://hornet.com/stories/cher-billboard-music-awards/", "title": "Cher Steals the Show at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Hornet is the best place to meet great guys and keep in touch, with 18 million users.
