The 21-year-old supermodel introduced the world to the alter ego she created for herself while on a work trip in Tokyo.\n\nHadid began posting photos of herself on Instagram wearing a blonde bob wig with bangs, along with lots of Chanel accessories and tiny sunglasses. She captioned the image, \u201c\ud83c\udf80Rebekka Harajuku \ud83c\udf80at your service.\u201d\n\nAs the weekend progressed, Hadid continued to post photos posing as her blonde doppleganger, whether Rebekka was dancing at a club in a black beret or checking herself out in a mirror before a night on the town in Tokyo.\n\nLooking for more style content?

Exclusive s\u2013t. \ud83c\uddef\ud83c\uddf5,\u201d Hadid captioned a photo of her alter ego.\n\nBut Hadid didn\u2019t just share photos of Rebekka\u2019s excursions in Tokyo on her own Instagram. It appears the model has taken things so far, she even made her Rebekka an Instagram account too.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Bella Hadid Is 21! Let\u2019s Celebrate With 21 of Her Most Out-There Outfits\n\nRebekka\u2019s account has only been live for a few days, but she\u2019s already racked up more than 15,000 followers, although she only follows five people including herself and best friend Fanny Bourdette-Donon, who is the International PR Director for Dior.\n\nImage zoom\n\nAlthough Hadid has not confirmed whether or not she runs Rebekka\u2019s Instagram account, based off of the shots, we can presume Hadid is behind it.\n\nWe can\u2019t be certain if Hadid will continue going out in public as Rebekka once she returns to the United States, but we\u2019ll be sure to enjoy her alter ego\u2019s continuous Instagram content in the meantime.", "images":
