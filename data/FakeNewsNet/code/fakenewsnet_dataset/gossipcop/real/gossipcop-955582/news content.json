As the chairman and C.E.O. of CBS Corporation, he oversees shows ranging from \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d His portfolio includes the premium cable channel Showtime, the publishing house Simon & Schuster, and a streaming service, CBS All Access. Moonves, who is sixty-eight, has a reputation for canny hiring and project selection. The Wall Street Journal recently called him a \u201cTV programming wizard\u201d; the Hollywood Reporter dubbed him a \u201cWall Street Hero.\u201d In the tumultuous field of network television, he has enjoyed rare longevity as a leader. Last year, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he earned nearly seventy million dollars, making him one of the highest-paid corporate executives in the world. In recent months, Moonves has become a prominent voice in Hollywood\u2019s #MeToo movement. In December, he helped found the Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, which is chaired by Anita Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s a watershed moment,\u201d Moonves said at a conference in November. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that a company\u2019s culture will not allow for this. And that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s far-reaching. There\u2019s a lot we\u2019re learning. There\u2019s a lot we didn\u2019t know.\u201d But Moonves\u2019s private actions belie his public statements. Six women who had professional dealings with him told me that, between the nineteen-eighties and the late aughts, Moonves sexually harassed them. Four described forcible touching or kissing during business meetings, in what they said appeared to be a practiced routine. Two told me that Moonves physically intimidated them or threatened to derail their careers. All said that he became cold or hostile after they rejected his advances, and that they believed their careers suffered as a result. \u201cWhat happened to me was a sexual assault, and then I was fired for not participating,\u201d the actress and writer Illeana Douglas told me. All the women said they still feared that speaking out would lead to retaliation from Moonves, who is known in the industry for his ability to make or break careers. \u201cHe has gotten away with it for decades,\u201d the writer Janet Jones, who alleges that she had to shove Moonves off her after he forcibly kissed her at a work meeting, told me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just not O.K.\u201d Thirty current and former employees of CBS told me that such behavior extended from Moonves to important parts of the corporation, including CBS News and \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d one of the network\u2019s most esteemed programs. During Moonves\u2019s tenure, men at CBS News who were accused of sexual misconduct were promoted, even as the company paid settlements to women with complaints. It isn\u2019t clear whether Moonves himself knew of the allegations, but he has a reputation for being closely involved in management decisions across the network. Some of the allegations, such as those against the former anchor Charlie Rose, as reported by the Washington Post, have already become public. Other claims are being reported here for the first time. Nineteen current and former employees told me that Jeff Fager, the former chairman of CBS News and the current executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d allowed harassment in the division. \u201cIt\u2019s top down, this culture of older men who have all this power and you are nothing,\u201d one veteran producer told me. \u201cThe company is shielding lots of bad behavior.\u201d In a statement, Moonves said, \u201cThroughout my time at CBS, we have promoted a culture of respect and opportunity for all employees, and have consistently found success elevating women to top executive positions across our company. I recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected\u2014and abided by the principle\u2014that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career. This is a time when we all are appropriately focused on how we help improve our society, and we at CBS are committed to being part of the solution.\u201d According to CBS, there have been no misconduct claims and no settlements against Moonves during his twenty-four years at the network. A statement from the company said, \u201cCBS is very mindful of all workplace issues and takes each report of misconduct very seriously. We do not believe, however, that the picture of our company created in The New Yorker represents a larger organization that does its best to treat its tens of thousands of employees with dignity and respect. We are seeing vigorous discourse in our country about equality, inclusion, and safety in the workplace, and CBS is committed to being part of the solution to those important issues.\u201d The allegations are surfacing at a time when CBS is engaged in an increasingly acrimonious fight with its former parent company, Viacom, which acquired CBS in 1999 and spun it off as a separate entity seven years later. A holding company founded by the mogul Sumner Redstone still owns a majority stake in both Viacom and CBS, and Redstone\u2019s daughter and heir, Shari Redstone, has sought to reunite the businesses. Moonves has resisted the move, and in May Redstone\u2019s holding company and CBS filed lawsuits against each other. All of the women making allegations against Moonves began speaking to me before the current lawsuits, in independent interviews carried out during the past eight months. All said that they were not motivated by any allegiance in the corporate battle. But several felt that this was an opportunity to examine a workplace culture that many of the women in this story described as toxic.\n\nIlleana Douglas, who later received an Emmy nomination for her role in HBO\u2019s \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d was introduced to Moonves in 1996. At the time, she was meeting with networks, looking for a deal to write and perform for television. Moonves, who was then the president of CBS Entertainment, seemed to take a personal interest in her. He told Douglas that he was a fan of her performances in the Martin Scorsese films \u201cCape Fear\u201d and \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d and urged her to work with CBS. \u201cThere was the big sell\u2014he was telling me, \u2018You\u2019re gonna get a house with a pool, you\u2019re gonna love it, it\u2019s a great life,\u2019 \u201d Douglas recalled. She agreed to sign a holding deal with CBS, which promised to pay her three hundred thousand dollars to appear exclusively in the network\u2019s programs. CBS ultimately didn\u2019t proceed with a pilot that Douglas wrote, but the network cast her in a comedy called \u201cQueens,\u201d as an eccentric native of the New York borough. In March, 1997, shortly before production of the pilot episode began, Moonves called Douglas\u2019s manager, Melissa Prophet, and told her that he was concerned about Douglas\u2019s attitude during a reading with her co-star, Penelope Ann Miller. Prophet relayed the concern to Douglas, who was surprised and confused: the reading, in front of a group of CBS executives, had elicited uproarious laughter. Moonves, she said, had taken her by the shoulders and congratulated her. Moonves had told Prophet that he wanted to meet with Douglas, alone, to insure that they were creatively aligned. (Prophet told me that she did not recall the conversation or setting up the meeting.) By then, Douglas had worked closely with Moonves for months. \u201cHe seemed more than just my boss,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe was very much like a father figure.\u201d When Douglas met with Moonves at his office, she began to raise concerns about the \u201cQueens\u201d script, but Moonves, she recalled, cut her off. \u201cHe interrupts me to ask me am I single,\u201d she said. Douglas, whose nearly decade-long relationship with Scorsese was coming to an end, was caught off guard. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say at that point,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I\u2019m single, yes, no, maybe.\u2019 \u201d She began talking about the script, but Moonves interjected, asking to kiss her. According to Douglas, he said that they didn\u2019t have to tell her manager: \u201cIt\u2019ll just be between you and me. Come on, you\u2019re not some nubile virgin.\u201d As Douglas attempted to turn the focus back to work, Moonves, she said, grabbed her. \u201cIn a millisecond, he\u2019s got one arm over me, pinning me,\u201d she said. Moonves was \u201cviolently kissing\u201d her, holding her down on the couch with her arms above her head. \u201cWhat it feels like to have someone hold you down\u2014you can\u2019t breathe, you can\u2019t move,\u201d she said. \u201cThe physicality of it was horrendous.\u201d She recalled lying limp and unresponsive beneath him. \u201cYou sort of black out,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou think, How long is this going to go on? I was just looking at this nice picture of his family and his kids. I couldn\u2019t get him off me.\u201d She said it was only when Moonves, aroused, pulled up her skirt and began to thrust against her that her fear overcame her paralysis. She told herself that she had to do something to stop him. \u201cAt that point, you\u2019re a trapped animal,\u201d she told me. \u201cYour life is flashing before your eyes.\u201d Moonves, in what Douglas assumed was an effort to be seductive, paused and asked, \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Douglas told me, \u201cMy decision was to get out of it by joking my way out, so he feels flattered.\u201d Thinking that reminding Moonves that he was her boss might discourage him, she told him, \u201cYes, for the head of a network you\u2019re some good kisser.\u201d Moonves frowned and got up. She scrambled to find her briefcase. \u201cWell, this has been great. Thanks,\u201d she recalled saying, moving toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d Moonves, she said, followed her to the door and blocked her path. He backed her up to the wall, pressing against her, with his face close to hers. \u201cIt was physically scary,\u201d Douglas told me. \u201cHe says, \u2018We\u2019re going to keep this between you and me, right?\u2019 \u201d Attempting to put him off with a joke, she replied, \u201cNo, sir, we won\u2019t tell anyone that you\u2019re a good kisser.\u201d Moonves released her and, without looking at her, walked away. \u201cIt was so invasive,\u201d she said of the threatening encounter. \u201cIt has stayed with me the rest of my life, that terror.\u201d Outside Moonves\u2019s office, she began to cry. \u201cMy skirt is all twisted,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019m standing in the hall and I thought of his family.\u201d Moonves\u2019s assistant, sitting nearby, asked whether her parking needed to be validated. Douglas told me, \u201cI remember thinking, Does she know? Does this happen all the time?\u201d In her car, Douglas said, \u201cI lost it. I felt sick.\u201d Prophet, her manager, called and, as Douglas worked up the nerve to tell her what had happened, Prophet said that she had just got off the phone with Moonves. He\u2019d said that he and Douglas had a great meeting and \u201chad a lot of fun.\u201d Douglas told me, \u201cI thought, Oh, my God, he\u2019s covered his tracks.\u201d In that moment, she said, \u201cI decided, just bury it.\u201d Later that day, Douglas returned to the house she was renting and told a friend who was staying with her, the actor Craig Chester, about the incident. \u201cShe was trying not to cry, but her voice was shaking. I\u2019ve never seen her that emotional before,\u201d Chester recalled. \u201cShe said that he got on top of her and held her down and she couldn\u2019t get away. If it was any other situation outside business, I would have said, \u2018Let\u2019s go to the cops.\u2019 \u201d But, Chester said, \u201cthere was no talk about going to the police or anything like that, because it was obvious that it would be career suicide.\u201d The following week, Moonves showed up at the first day of rehearsals for \u201cQueens.\u201d \u201cAs soon as I saw him, I thought I was going to collapse. Everything came back to me. I was shaking,\u201d Douglas told me. She felt that Moonves\u2019s demeanor was intended to intimidate her. \u201cHe was eying me warily,\u201d she said. Her distress was evident to her co-stars. \u201cThere was obviously something going on with her emotionally,\u201d Penelope Ann Miller told me. \u201cWhen she came in to test, everything was on. And then, after, on set, it was like she wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Last year, before the rise of #MeToo, Douglas told Miller what had happened. \u201cHearing her story, it all made sense,\u201d Miller recalled. After the second rehearsal, Moonves took Douglas aside. \u201c \u2018What the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing out there? You\u2019re not even trying,\u2019 \u201d Douglas recalled Moonves saying. She took it as a reference to her failure to comply with his advances and to maintain her composure afterward. Douglas told me that she had \u201cplayed by all the rules, I didn\u2019t say anything, and now he was berating me.\u201d On set, she struggled to keep her comedic timing, and cried in front of other cast members. Several days into rehearsals, Moonves called Douglas at home. \u201cIt was, you know, \u2018You make me fucking sick. You are not funny,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. Moonves told her that she wouldn\u2019t \u201cget a fucking dime\u201d of the money she was owed, and that she would \u201cnever work at this network again.\u201d (In a statement, CBS said that Moonves acknowledges trying to kiss Douglas, but that \u201che denies any characterization of \u2018sexual assault,\u2019 intimidation, or retaliatory action,\u201d including berating her on set and personally firing her from \u201cQueens.\u201d) Prophet told me that Moonves and CBS Business Affairs called her to say that Douglas would be replaced on the show and that her deal would be cancelled. According to Douglas, Prophet called her and \u201csaid I\u2019d burned all my bridges at CBS, that she was firing me.\u201d (Prophet recalled firing Douglas and said that the two had a heated exchange. She said that she didn\u2019t know about Douglas\u2019s allegation, and denied the comment about burning bridges. \u201cThere are no bridges at CBS,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is just Les Moonves.\u201d) Douglas said that her agent, Patrick Whitesell, who was then at Creative Artists Agency, later called to say that the agency wished her well in future endeavors of her own. \u201cI love the way C.A.A. fired me,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThey never told me I was fired. They just kept wishing me the best of luck.\u201d (Whitesell told me that he had not been aware of Douglas\u2019s allegation and did not recall that her departure from C.A.A. was related to the dissolution of her CBS deal.) Distraught, Douglas called Scorsese and told him the story, saying that she wanted to hire a lawyer and sue Moonves. Scorsese said that he remembers Douglas calling him about the allegation and being shocked by it. Scorsese urged her to be cautious about taking legal action against such a powerful person, but agreed to refer her to his law firm; there, Douglas began working with an attorney named Bill Sobel. Sobel confirmed that Douglas had described the encounter with Moonves at the time, and his contemporaneous notes back up her account. \u201cI believed Illeana,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat happened to her was reprehensible.\u201d Douglas told me that Sobel warned her that it was a matter of her word against Moonves\u2019s. Sobel, who said that he had a frank conversation with Douglas about the risks of suing, ultimately called CBS to attempt to recoup some of her lost wages. (She had received a fifty-thousand-dollar advance payment for her appearance in the \u201cQueens\u201d pilot, but felt that she was owed the remaining two hundred and fifty thousand.) After a junior staff member at CBS Business Affairs told Sobel that Douglas had been fired because of her poor performance in rehearsals, and that the network intended to withhold her pay, Sobel suggested that he ask Moonves about the meeting he had had alone with Douglas. \u201cMy conversation was simply \u2018Hey, ask Les what happened in the room, and he\u2019ll probably want you to do the right thing here,\u2019 \u201d Sobel told me. \u201cI felt he knew what I was saying.\u201d According to communications and contracts reviewed by The New Yorker, the head of CBS Business Affairs, rather than the junior staffer, replied to Sobel with a new proposition. \u201cWhen the head of the whole thing called me back,\u201d Sobel said, \u201cit was very clear to me that they took my comments about what happened in the room very seriously.\u201d CBS proposed that the agreement be \u201csettled out\u201d for a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars, and then agreed to pay Douglas an additional two hundred and fifty thousand to appear in a new miniseries. Douglas and Sobel both saw the miniseries as cover for a settlement; she didn\u2019t even know what the show was about. \u201cI go from being sexually assaulted, fired for not having sex with Les Moonves, fired by everyone, to \u2018We are going to pay you in full and we also want you to be on this miniseries,\u2019 \u201d Douglas recalled. \u201cMy understanding is, this is what they were going to do in exchange for not suing.\u201d Shortly after the offer came, Douglas received a call from Moonves. \u201c \u2018So, you\u2019re gonna do the mini?\u2019 \u201d she remembered him asking. Although she wanted accountability, she was still frightened, and said that she would do it. She recalled Moonves, sounding upbeat, remarking, \u201c \u2018Tits and guns, baby. Tits and guns.\u2019 \u201d (Douglas later learned that the miniseries, called \u201cBella Mafia,\u201d focussed on the women of an Italian crime family and emphasized sex and violence.) Moonves asked Douglas if they were \u201cO.K.,\u201d and Douglas replied, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d In its statement, CBS said that the agreement with Douglas about \u201cBella Mafia\u201d was intended to fulfill her over-all deal with the network, and was unrelated to her meeting with Moonves. \u201cThere were no funds added for settlement purposes,\u201d CBS said. \u201cThe amount paid was half of what she was owed, which is not what one might do if concerned about a claim such as this.\u201d Jo An Kincaid, an executive producer on the \u201cQueens\u201d pilot and Penelope Ann Miller\u2019s manager at the time, said that she was not consulted about Douglas\u2019s dismissal. \u201cOne day she was just not there. Gone and replaced,\u201d Kincaid said. \u201cIt was very unusual. I was an executive producer. There should have been an explanation.\u201d In an e-mail, Judge Reinhold, one of Douglas\u2019s co-stars, wrote, \u201cIlleana was hilariously unique in her comedy and fun to work with.\u201d He added, \u201cWe were all surprised and disappointed that she left.\u201d Douglas told numerous people about the incident over the years, and even published a lightly fictionalized version of it in a 2006 compilation, \u201cFired!\u201d She also performed the story before audiences. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly keep it a secret,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cPeople used to come up to me afterward and go, \u2018I know who it is,\u2019 and just laugh about it.\u201d Douglas appeared in \u201cBella Mafia,\u201d and, afterward, C.A.A. resumed representing her. But she believes that the incident \u201cderailed any future career I would have had at CBS.\u201d In two instances, years later, personal connections helped her secure acting roles on shows that aired on the network, and a Web series of hers appeared on a CBS streaming service. But otherwise, in a career that has included extensive work with every other major network, she said, \u201cI never auditioned or ever had any kind of television-show deal at CBS.\u201d Like the other women I spoke to, she said that people around her discouraged her from publicly naming Moonves in this story. She told me that she was doing so because she wanted to protect other women, and that she wished she had been warned before her meeting. \u201cIn retrospect, of course, you say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s all a crazy setup,\u2019 \u201d she told me. \u201cI was, I hate to say it, the perfect victim.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade earlier, in the spring of 1985, Janet Jones was attempting to break into the industry as a writer. The producer Mike Marvin liked an idea that Jones had for a screenplay, and helped broker a meeting between her and Moonves, who at the time was a vice-president at Twentieth Century Fox. It was Jones\u2019s first pitch meeting in Hollywood. Moonves\u2019s assistant scheduled a late-afternoon appointment at his office. When Jones arrived, many employees were leaving for the day, but Moonves\u2019s assistant was there. \u201cI had my briefcase and my pants suit,\u201d Jones recalled. \u201cI was really prepared.\u201d Moonves surprised her by asking if she wanted a glass of wine. She declined, sat down on the couch, and began pitching her screenplay. Suddenly, Jones told me, \u201che came around the corner of the table and threw himself on top of me. It was very fast.\u201d Moonves, she said, began trying to kiss her. Jones said that she struggled, and then shoved Moonves away hard, yelling, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Moonves, appearing startled, got up. \u201c \u2018Well, I was hitting on you. I wanted a kiss,\u2019 \u201d she recalled him saying. Jones began to leave. \u201cHe said, \u2018Oh, come on, it\u2019s nothing,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201c \u2018Calm down, don\u2019t be so excited.\u2019 \u201d When Jones got to the door, it was locked. She was terrified. \u201cIf you don\u2019t open this door,\u201d she told him, \u201cI am going to scream so loud and so long that everyone on the lot is going to come over.\u201d She remembered Moonves walking to his desk or to a nearby bureau to unlock the door, rather than doing so directly. She fled, noticing on her way out that the assistant had left. \u201cThat\u2019s when I got really upset,\u201d she told me. \u201cI just thought, Oh, my God. This wasn\u2019t like a little momentary boo-boo. It was this well-thought-out thing.\u201d Jones drove to the house of a friend, the artist Linda Salzman Sagan. There, Jones told me, \u201cI just completely melted down, just crying and shaking.\u201d Sagan told me that she remembers the visit clearly, and that Jones described the incident in detail at the time. \u201cShe was very, very upset,\u201d Sagan recalled. \u201cI had never seen her like that. I was really astounded by what she told me. I knew how powerful he was in terms of a career.\u201d Jones also told her boyfriend at the time, Larry Jackson, who said, \u201cShe came home one day scared and in tears because she said Les had jumped her at a business meeting.\u201d Mike Marvin told me that he remembers introducing Jones to Moonves, and that she was troubled by the meeting. He said that he confronted Moonves about it at a gathering, saying, \u201cWhatever happened, that girl was upset.\u201d Moonves, Marvin said, became furious. \u201cWe definitely had a screaming match over this,\u201d Marvin told me. Not long afterward, Jones received a call from Moonves\u2019s assistant, who said that she had Moonves on the line. \u201cMy heart went into my feet,\u201d Jones recalled. Moonves began shouting at her. \u201c \u2018People\u2019s reputations are important. Do you understand?\u2019 \u201d she remembered him saying. \u201c \u2018I\u2019m warning you. I will ruin your career. You will never get a writing job. No one will hire you. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying to you?\u2019 \u201d Jones hung up the phone, then threw up. \u201cI was just absolutely mortified. Does this mean he\u2019ll be putting me on a list somewhere and I\u2019ll never get a job?\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cThis person could stop me from doing this passion, this career I had spent my whole life putting together. It\u2019s kind of hard to fathom that one person could do that, but he could.\u201d (CBS said that Moonves has no recollection of the interactions with Jones.) Jones told me that she found the threats more scarring than the original incident. She said, \u201cThe revenge behavior, the \u2018I\u2019ll get you for not kissing me, I\u2019ll get you for not doing what the hell I want you to do\u2019\u2014it never quite leaves you.\u201d Years later, she saw him at an industry event and, she said, \u201cI almost fainted. I was still terrified.\u201d\n\nTwo other women described Moonves forcibly touching or kissing them during business meetings. The producer Christine Peters was an industry veteran when she first encountered Moonves, in the early aughts. She had worked as a story analyst for the company behind \u201cRain Man\u201d and \u201cGorillas in the Mist\u201d before becoming a production head for Robert Evans, who had produced \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cChinatown.\u201d She became a close friend and confidante of Sumner Redstone, the owner of Viacom, to whom she was at times romantically linked in the press. (Peters, like the other women in this story, said that she had no interest in the battle over the future of Redstone\u2019s empire.) After Viacom acquired CBS, Redstone enlisted Peters to help build a rapport with Moonves, who was the president and C.E.O. of CBS Television at the time. They had a series of dinners with Moonves and his wife in 2003 and 2004. Peters produced the 2003 romantic comedy \u201cHow to Lose a Guy in Ten Days,\u201d which was based on a book she had acquired, and which ultimately grossed more than a hundred and seventy-seven million dollars. \u201cI was proud to be bringing females into the seats and really addressing them,\u201d she told me. In 2006, Moonves, who had become the chairman of CBS, had dinner with Peters and Redstone to discuss his plans to launch a film studio, CBS Films, which was founded the next year. Moonves was considering executives to oversee the endeavor, and Redstone suggested Peters. Moonves seemed excited about the idea. When Moonves and Peters met at his office to discuss the prospect, Peters told me, she came with a detailed presentation on her business model, which focussed on female audiences. \u201cIt was: this is the demographic, here are the underutilized release dates, here\u2019s why female buyers predominate,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember him being very enthusiastic, saying it made a lot of sense.\u201d She was sitting on a couch and, as she continued her pitch, he sat down uncomfortably close. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is really great,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cThen he just put a hand up my skirt.\u201d Moonves, she said, slid his hand up her thigh and touched her underwear. \u201cI was in a state of shock,\u201d Peters recalled. Immediately, she worried about how Moonves would react to a rejection. She tried to get out of the situation by gathering her documents and saying, \u201cOh, wow, oh, my God, it\u2019s late, I have to be at another meeting. Can we finish this tomorrow? I\u2019m so excited! So excited!\u201d Moonves, she recalled, suggested that he walk her to her car. Fearing further advances, Peters said that she had a driver outside. She had come to the meeting with a colleague, who was waiting in the lobby. The colleague told me that Peters emerged earlier than anticipated, appearing shaken, and said that they had to leave quickly. An acquaintance of Peters\u2019s told me that she recounted the story to him several years ago, describing an advance from a top executive and a job that she didn\u2019t get afterward, without naming Moonves. Last year, Peters told him that the executive was Moonves. (CBS said that Moonves categorically denies any alleged touching or inappropriate conduct during the meeting.) Peters told me, \u201cI remember sitting in the car and just crying. I worked my whole life to be here and I just lost my opportunity.\u201d Because of her long tenure in the industry, Peters said, \u201cI expected to be taken seriously. I never in a million years saw that coming.\u201d She said that she was surprised in part because she thought her relationship with Redstone would have put Moonves on guard. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand why he would do that in light of the situation with Sumner,\u201d she told me. In the end, she decided not to tell Redstone, because she worried about what the fallout might be. Like Jones, Peters told me that Moonves \u201cwas smart enough to not have anyone there. It was a setup.\u201d (Twice in later years, Peters participated in group meetings that involved Moonves.) A prominent actress who played a police officer on a long-running CBS program, who was too frightened of reprisals to use her name, said that she also attended a business meeting with Moonves that ended in unwanted advances. The actress had known Moonves for years. In the late eighties, at the height of her show\u2019s popularity, Moonves, who was then at a production company called Lorimar, requested a lunch meeting at a restaurant. There, Moonves told the actress that he had long had a crush on her but had not said anything to her because she had been in a relationship with a mutual friend. She declined his advance but thanked him for lunch. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t offensive,\u201d she recalled. In 1995, when Moonves became president of CBS Entertainment, the actress called to congratulate him. \u201cHe said, \u2018You should have fucked me when I asked you to,\u2019 and I said, \u2018No shit!\u2019 \u201d the actress told me. They laughed. Soon afterward, CBS Business Affairs informed the actress that her series deal with CBS was being terminated. She called Moonves and expressed shock. He requested a lunch meeting in his private dining room at the office. She told me, \u201cI went in, I thought, to make a deal.\u201d At the lunch, Moonves told her that he intended to focus on younger talent, and that she was too old. \u201cThen he again said, \u2018I\u2019ve always been so attracted to you,\u2019 \u201d she told me. \u201cI was so upset. I said, \u2018Jesus, Leslie, I\u2019m gonna go.\u2019 \u201d Moonves asked her to sit down. She did so, pushing food around her plate until she had to leave. Then, she told me, \u201cI walked over and leaned to give him a kiss on the cheek.\u201d Moonves, she said, grabbed her and forcibly kissed her: \u201cHe shoved his tongue down my throat. I mean shoved.\u201d Appalled, she pushed him away. \u201cHe had approached me to go to bed with him twice, but he did it politely,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this time he just stuck his tongue down my throat.\u201d As she left, she began to cry. \u201cNo one had ever done that to me before,\u201d she said. \u201cI found it sickening.\u201d Like Douglas, the actress said that she never worked for CBS again. Almost two decades later, an executive at CBS contacted her about coming back to the network. It turned out that the executive wanted her to sign a book deal with Simon & Schuster, which is owned by CBS. (CBS said that Moonves has no recollection of making unwelcome advances toward the actress, and that he made no efforts to block future business between her and CBS.) The actress thought that the consequences would be too great if she told CBS about the incident. \u201cI never reported it,\u201d she told me. \u201cI just thought, Gee, there goes my career.\u201d At an event not long afterward, she encountered a showrunner who has overseen multiple programs at CBS, and told her the story. The showrunner, who had also worked with Moonves, recalled that the actress was still hurt by the incident and told me that she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the story. \u201cI had already had to deal with misogynist bullying from him myself,\u201d she told me. \u201cOur research has proved that the chicken came not just before the egg but before anything else in the known universe.\u201d\n\nTwo women told me that they rebuffed unwanted advances from Moonves in professional settings, and that they believed career opportunities disappeared as a result. Dinah Kirgo, who won an Emmy as a writer for \u201cThe Tracey Ullman Show,\u201d first encountered Moonves in the early eighties, when he was the vice-president of development at Saul Ilson Productions, a partnership with Columbia Pictures Television. She and her sister and producing partner, Julie Kirgo, met with Moonves and others about a television deal. \u201cWe left the meeting very confident we had an over-all deal with Leslie,\u201d Kirgo told me. The sisters told their agent to expect an offer from Moonves. Instead, shortly after Kirgo got home, Moonves called her directly. \u201cHe said, \u2018That was a great meeting, now we have to go out to dinner,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. Kirgo replied that she and Julie would be happy to have dinner with him. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, just you and me.\u2019 He said, \u2018You\u2019re very expensive, and I need to know you\u2019re worth it,\u2019 \u201d Kirgo told me. \u201cI was sort of in shock and I said, \u2018Well, Leslie, I don\u2019t think your wife would appreciate us having that kind of dinner.\u2019 \u201d Moonves coldly ended the conversation. (CBS said that Moonves has no recollection of the meeting or the phone call.) Kirgo and her sister never heard from Moonves again. Afterward, Kirgo\u2019s agents told her they had received reports that she had a reputation for being difficult to work with. Kirgo told me that she had never heard complaints before, and that she believed saying no to Moonves had hurt her career. \u201cIt\u2019s very insidious, what he did,\u201d she said. Julie Kirgo confirmed the details of her sister\u2019s story and said that Dinah had told her about the call at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of awful to feel that you have energy and talent and that\u2019s being appreciated, and then suddenly to find out that that\u2019s not where somebody\u2019s interests lie at all. You feel betrayed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pisses me off to this day.\u201d In 1992, a former child star who asked to be identified only by her first name, Kimberly, was introduced to Moonves by a friend, who was a member of Moonves\u2019s staff and told her that Moonves could help her get back into television. At a dinner meeting that the three attended, Moonves began by asking questions about Kimberly\u2019s acting career. But when the friend went to the bathroom Moonves turned to Kimberly and said, in a perfunctory way, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s just get a hotel room. Let\u2019s just do this.\u201d She was shocked. \u201cI said, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 \u201d When she explained that she had a husband and a child, Moonves became angry and left. (The friend recalled making the introduction to Moonves, and said that her only motivation in doing so was to help Kimberly\u2019s career. CBS said that Moonves has no memory or record of the meeting.) \u201cThe power differential was so great,\u201d Kimberly told me. \u201cI was really scared, because I thought I was burning some sort of a bridge that was going to be great for me.\u201d As a child star, she said, \u201cI\u2019d been taught that powerful people can hurt you, they can ruin you, they can ruin your career.\u201d She said that the turn from business meeting to sexual overture seemed to be well practiced. \u201cIt was set up to be that way,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, Wow, is this the way the world works and I just don\u2019t get it?\u201d\n\nCBS is a multibillion-dollar corporation, with dozens of divisions, and Moonves is only indirectly involved with many of them. However, experts on sexual harassment told me that misconduct by a chief executive can reverberate across aspects of even the largest companies. \u201cIf you have a company with an abuser on the top, they typically surround themselves with people like them, who engage in similar behavior,\u201d Debra Katz, a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment, told me. \u201cIt can put a set of enablers in place, who protect powerful people when they get challenged for misconduct, and who work to discredit and manage out women who come forward with allegations.\u201d Thirty current and former CBS employees described harassment, gender discrimination, or retaliation at the network. Many said that men accused of misconduct were promoted, even after the company was made aware of those allegations. Their stories match several that have already emerged in public reports. Earlier this year, Leslie Isaacs, a vice-president at Pop, the cable channel jointly operated by CBS and the film studio Lionsgate, filed a lawsuit alleging that CBS was aware of a hostile workplace at the channel. Her complaint described harassment and discrimination by male colleagues, including a vice-president who allegedly instructed female employees to \u201cshow your clients your tits.\u201d Isaacs told me, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be happening at Pop if it wasn\u2019t covered up at CBS, and if CBS wasn\u2019t complicit. They know, and it\u2019s been tolerated.\u201d (Isaacs has entered into a private mediation process with CBS. A Pop spokesperson said, \u201cPop engaged an independent investigator who conducted a complete investigation and found nothing to corroborate this alleged statement.\u201d CBS said that it flatly denies any efforts to cover this up.) In December, CBS confirmed that Brad Kern, the showrunner and executive producer of \u201cNCIS: New Orleans,\u201d had been the subject of sexual-harassment and gender-discrimination allegations. He had retained his position for more than a year after the company was made aware of the claims. (This season, Kern stepped down from his position as showrunner, but he remains a consulting producer. Last month, the company said that it was launching a new investigation\u2014its third\u2014into Kern\u2019s behavior. CBS said that the allegations were investigated and resulted in disciplinary action but that the matter \u201cmerits further inquiry.\u201d) Other allegations have centered on CBS News. Last summer, Erin Gee, who worked at CBS for more than fifteen years, filed a lawsuit alleging that an executive director at \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d urged her to have sex with a co-worker with whom she was having difficulties in order to \u201cbreak the ice,\u201d and that she was demoted after complaining about gender discrimination. In May, a magistrate judge in New York criticized CBS for failing to save e-mails from the time of Gee\u2019s allegation. \u201cI find the conduct of CBS here to be shocking,\u201d the judge, Sarah Netburn, reportedly said during a hearing. \u201cIt is hard to draw any other conclusion than that they were trying to avoid producing and saving those e-mails.\u201d (The network has since reached a settlement with Gee, and her attorney declined to comment. CBS said that \u201cthe matter has been resolved.\u201d) In 2015, a CBS reporter, Kenneth Lombardi, alleged in a lawsuit that a CBS News supervisor texted him links to pornography, and that a senior producer had grabbed his crotch. Lombardi claimed that when he complained to a manager she replied, \u201cNever bring up gender discrimination again!\u201d (An attorney for Lombardi said that he was not at liberty to discuss the suit. CBS said that the matter has been resolved.) In November, Charlie Rose was suspended after the Washington Post reported that eight women had accused him of sexual harassment, including groping. According to the Post, Rose has now been accused of sexual harassment by at least thirty-five women, and managers at the network were made aware of the allegations on at least three occasions. (Rose apologized in response to the initial allegations, but called the paper\u2019s subsequent reporting on additional complaints \u201cunfair and inaccurate.\u201d) \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the news division\u2019s flagship program, for which Rose was a contributing correspondent, has been a focal point of allegations. Some of those allegations involve Jeff Fager, who is currently the executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d and whom Moonves appointed chairman of CBS News in 2011, a position he held until 2015. Six former employees told me that Fager, while inebriated at company parties, would touch employees in ways that made them uncomfortable. One former \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer told me, \u201cIt was always \u2018Let\u2019s go say hello to Jeff, \u2019cause you have to pay homage to him, but let\u2019s do it early in the evening, before he starts getting really handsy.\u2019 \u201d In one incident, at which several employees were present, Fager allegedly made drunken advances to an associate producer, commenting on her breasts and becoming belligerent when she rebuffed him. (Fager denied the allegations, saying that \u201cthey never happened.\u201d) Others said that Fager protected men accused of misconduct, including men who reported to him. According to several people who were told about the incident at the time, a senior producer named Vicki Gordon alleged that another senior producer, Michael Radutzky, threatened to throw furniture at her and twisted her arm behind her back, causing her to scream. (Radutzky categorically denied the allegations, saying that they were fabricated.) The sources told me that Fager said he would address the matter with Radutzky directly, and instructed Gordon not to inform the CBS office of human resources. Later, Fager asked her to apologize to Radutzky, to mitigate conflict in the office. (Fager said, \u201cI have never discouraged anyone from going to H.R.\u201d) Radutzky, who left the network earlier this year, remained in his job for several years after the alleged incident. \u201cIt was common knowledge at \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that Michael Radutzky was an out-of-control guy, especially but not exclusively toward women. We all saw it, almost on a daily basis,\u201d David Gelber, a former producer, told me. \u201cAnd yet Fager not only tolerated him\u2014he elevated him to a position of leadership, even after Fager knew perfectly well how abusive he was.\u201d (Radutzky strongly denied Gelber\u2019s characterization of his behavior.) Sophie Gayter, a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d employee who alleged to the Post that Charlie Rose had groped her, told me that Fager \u201cenabled the other men on the floor to do whatever the heck they wanted.\u201d Fager, one network executive said, \u201cwould let people know he communicated with Les directly,\u201d adding that \u201cpeople took that to mean Les supported him completely.\u201d CBS, one former associate producer said, \u201cis an old network. Everything in there feels old: the people, the furniture, the culture, the mores.\u201d Many of the women described the atmosphere at CBS News specifically as a \u201cfrat house.\u201d One former employee said, \u201cI had several producers and editors over the age of sixty who would greet me by kissing me on the mouth. I had people touch my butt a couple times.\u201d She added, \u201cFager seemed to encourage that climate. It wasn\u2019t even that he turned a blind eye toward it.\u201d Katie Couric, who was an anchor at the network and a contributing correspondent for \u201c60 Minutes\u201d from 2006 to 2011, when Fager helped force her out, told me that it \u201cfelt like a boys\u2019 club, where a number of talented women seemed to be marginalized and undervalued.\u201d In a statement, Fager said, \u201cIt is wrong that our culture can be falsely defined by a few people with an axe to grind who are using an important movement as a weapon to get even, and not by the hundreds of women and men that have thrived, both personally and professionally, at \u201860 Minutes.\u2019 \u201d He added, \u201cA majority of our senior staff are women. All of them worked their way up the ranks and are now managers of our broadcast. Half of our producers and a majority of our associate producers are women. It is a challenging place to do well and promotions are earned on merit and are not based on gender.\u201d Lesley Stahl, who has been a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d correspondent since 1991, told me, \u201cThis notion that \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is an unpleasant, unwelcoming place for women isn\u2019t true.\u201d She said, \u201cIn my own experience, Jeff is supportive of women and decent to women.\u201d Anderson Cooper, who has been a correspondent for the show since 2006, told me, \u201cI work there part time, but in all the years I\u2019ve been there I\u2019ve never seen Jeff engage in any inappropriate behavior.\u201d Gayter and another junior female employee told me that their bosses asked them to complete the company\u2019s mandatory online sexual-harassment training programs for them. \u201cMany assistants did it for their bosses,\u201d Gayter said. \u201cWe\u2019d book their travel, do their expenses, and then do their sexual-harassment training.\u201d Former employees told me that there were few avenues for them to register confidential complaints about discrimination and misconduct. \u201cPeople say, \u2018You could call H.R.\u2019 Honestly, I\u2019ve never met a single person from H.R.,\u201d one producer said. \u201cThere\u2019s no oversight.\u201d Some said that they had witnessed retaliation against those who did attempt to speak out. At CBS News, \u201cthere was no one to turn to,\u201d one former producer told me, saying that she had reported Charlie Rose\u2019s behavior, and that the complaint resulted in no repercussions for Rose. \u201cIf it\u2019s just behavior from the top, tolerated at the top, and there\u2019s no one to talk to, what do you do?\u201d she said. A former journalist at \u201c60 Minutes\u201d named Habiba Nosheen told me that she had complained to management that Ira Rosen, a producer on the program, had subjected her to numerous sexual comments and suggested that she flirt with sources. Two other women told me that they had experienced similar conduct from Rosen. (In a statement, Rosen said that \u201cCBS extensively investigated these complaints and found them to be false, misleading, and unsubstantiated.\u201d He said, \u201cI have always and continue to deny these allegations.\u201d) \u201cBut seriously, folks, the way you raised me it\u2019s no wonder I can\u2019t get a gig in a real night club.\u201d When Nosheen filed a written complaint and met with Fager about the allegations against Rosen, she said, he told her not to worry about the possibility that other women might be harassed by Rosen. She told me that Fager is \u201can enabler of this \u2018Mad Men\u2019 culture at \u201860 Minutes.\u2019 \u201d Afterward, there appeared to be no repercussions for Rosen, and she was frozen out of assignments. Days after she made her complaint to Fager, he and two of his deputies called Nosheen into a meeting to go over criticisms of her work performance which she found specious. One involved a tense exchange with a co-worker that had happened a year earlier. The format of the meeting, she said, was highly unusual. \u201cIt was so obvious to me that they began to implement a strategy of retaliation,\u201d she told me. In June, 2016, Nosheen filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. She resigned a month later. \u201cAs an investigative journalist, every day I try to hold people in power accountable. I look people in the eye and ask them why they turned their backs when they witnessed something unethical happening,\u201d she told me. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t look myself in the mirror and hold others accountable if I wasn\u2019t brave enough to do the same in my own place of work.\u201d An e-mail from a CBS lawyer shows that, after Nosheen left the network, CBS threatened to enforce a non-compete clause in her contract, which would prevent her from seeking employment elsewhere, unless she withdrew her E.E.O.C. complaint and signed a nondisclosure agreement. The E.E.O.C. ultimately issued a Notice of Dismissal and Right to Sue letter, saying that it was unable to conclude whether or not a violation of federal law had occurred and that it would be up to Nosheen to pursue the matter in civil court. Another woman told me that she had spoken to CBS\u2019s legal department about Rosen\u2019s and Fager\u2019s behavior. \u201cI was shocked by the lack of seriousness and regard that CBS legal showed my story,\u201d she told me. (In a statement, CBS\u2019s chief compliance officer said, \u201cIt is the policy and practice of CBS to investigate all complaints and to promptly remediate any problems that are identified,\u201d adding that \u201cthe policies against discrimination and harassment include anti-retaliation provisions, and anyone raising a complaint is assured that he or she will be protected from retaliation.\u201d) The woman told me that she eventually left the network because of the atmosphere. \u201cA lot of my memories of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 are of other women coming into my office, closing the door, and just breaking down because of working as a woman at CBS,\u201d she said. \u201cToward the end of my time there, I thought, God, I love the stories, I love the work, but this has to be easier somewhere else.\u201d The producer who talked about Fager\u2019s behavior at parties told me that she, too, left the show because of \u201ca very toxic culture toward women.\u201d She said, \u201cWhat makes me really upset was this was something I really loved doing, and I was good at, and won a lot of awards for. And I basically had to leave the business, because where else am I going to go? There were other places, but nothing of that stature.\u201d The New Yorker reviewed three six-figure settlements with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d employees who have filed complaints of sexual harassment or discrimination. The women who received those payments were required to sign nondisclosure agreements that prevented them from speaking about their experiences, with penalties for any breach. Several other women who have made allegations against CBS News declined to speak with me on the record, citing nondisclosure agreements. (The CBS chief compliance officer said, \u201cOn occasion, the resolution of allegations in the workplace has involved financial settlements,\u201d adding that \u201csettlements do not amount to admissions of guilt.\u201d) \u201cThe N.D.A.s are a silencer and a bully tactic,\u201d Mo Cashin, who worked in several roles for CBS News, including as a broadcast manager, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate and hypocritical, particularly in the media, where it appears executives have more interest in protecting and oftentimes rewarding fellow senior employees who have a documented history of bad behavior than protecting their victims.\u201d Fager has tried to keep the allegations about the treatment of women at \u201c60 Minutes\u201d from surfacing publicly. According to the Times, in 2015 Fager took over the writing of a book about \u201c60 Minutes\u201d after the original author, Richard Zoglin, began asking people about the subject. In April, as two Washington Post reporters, Irin Carmon and Amy Brittain, were reporting an article about the allegations of harassment at CBS News, including complaints about Fager and Rosen, lawyers retained by Fager threatened to sue the Post, and presented testimonials about Fager\u2019s good character. \u201cThere was this ham-handed effort to make women at the show say Jeff was a wonderful person,\u201d one producer said. \u201cIt was so obvious we were doing it with a gun to our heads.\u201d Fager\u2019s lawyers also attacked the professionalism of the two reporters. In the end, the paper published a story that included complaints of harassment against Charlie Rose from dozens of women, but not allegations about Fager or Rosen. In a statement, the Post said, \u201cThe reporting throughout was vigorous and sustained and fully supported by Post editors. Nothing that met our longstanding standards for publication was left out. Nor did outside pressures, legal or otherwise, determine what was published.\u201d CBS employees told me that they were alarmed by the attempts to kill the reporting. \u201cThe hypocrisy of an investigative news program shutting down an investigative print story is incredible,\u201d one told me. Fager said, \u201cThere\u2019s a reason these awful allegations have not been published before\u2014despite the efforts of a few former employees who did not succeed at \u201860 Minutes.\u2019 It is because they are false, anonymous, and do not hold up to editorial scrutiny.\u201d The CBS chief compliance officer said, \u201cCBS previously retained attorney Betsy Plevan of Proskauer Rose to conduct an independent investigation of alleged misconduct at CBS News. Ms. Plevan\u2019s work is ongoing, and includes investigating allegations in this story. CBS has taken the allegations reported in the press seriously, and respects the role of the press in pursuing the truth, which is a role that is central to the mission of CBS News.\u201d In June, Carmon, in a speech accepting a Mirror Award for the Post\u2019s reporting on Charlie Rose, warned that stories of abuse by powerful men in the news industry were still being suppressed. \u201cThe stories that we have been doing are actually about a system. The system has lawyers and a good reputation. It has publicists,\u201d she said. \u201cIndeed, the system is sitting in this room. Some more than others.
