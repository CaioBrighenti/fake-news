Well, one theory is that she was desperate for work, which is a lousy position for a star who was once so highly employable to be in. So, accepting whatever middle-aged lady roles she was offered may have made the difference for Zellweger between seeing screen time or not \u2014 even if they aren't the kind of movies that would make for an amazing mid-life career renaissance.\n\nThere's also a chance Zellweger's just not all that interested in Hollywood anymore, especially when you consider the fact that she disappeared almost as quickly as she reappeared after Bridget Jones' Baby came and went. If that's the case, then we say: Do your thing, Ren\u00e9e! Still, we have our suspicions that Zellweger will break out onto the acting scene once more when the time is right\u2026", "images": ["https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/she-took-a-six-year-hiatus-from-acting-1488992195.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "http://wp.looper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger.jpg", "https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/her-bid-to-get-behind-the-scenes-didnt-work-1488992195.jpg", "https://img4.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/shes-been-tied-up-in-court-1488992195.jpg", "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/shes-not-being-offered-great-roles-1488992195.jpg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/-1488992195.jpg", "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/shes-got-some-demons-1488992195.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/her-next-movie-is-already-in-trouble-1488992195.jpg", "https://img4.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/her-reappearance-caused-a-stir-1488992195.jpg", "https://img4.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/heres-how-she-can-turn-it-around-1488992195.jpg", "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/shes-an-old-school-star-in-an-mcu-world-1488992195.jpg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/and-shes-too-good-at-playing-bridget-jones-1488992195.jpg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/she-hasnt-embraced-the-internet-1488992195.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg"], "top_img": "http://wp.looper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kat Rosenfield"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/47382/hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger-anymore/", "title": "Why Hollywood won't cast Renee Zellweger anymore", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://wp.looper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/why-hollywood-wont-cast-renee-zellweger.jpg", "title": "Why Hollywood won't cast Renee Zellweger anymore", "description": "Renee Zellweger was a serious star.
