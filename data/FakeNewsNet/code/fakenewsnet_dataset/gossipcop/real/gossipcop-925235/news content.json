And while she is proud of the work she did with the HBO franchise, she says there was one particular scene from the second movie that left her \u201cdevastated.\u201d\n\nSitting down for an interview on The Wendy Williams Show on Wednesday, April 4, Nixon recalled how she felt when the audience cheered toward the end of a screening in London. While applause is usually a good thing, the actress was disappointed that what sparked it was a scene where Mr. Big (Chris Noth) surprises Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) with a huge new closet.\n\n\u201cI was a little devastated by that,\u201d Nixon confessed. \u201cIt seemed to me that the show was so much about female empowerment and about women making their own choices and women standing up for what they wanted and supporting themselves. So, to me, to have this [scene] be a kind of a climax of the film, that your very wealthy husband built you a really nice closet for your clothes, I thought, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s not really what you love about the show, is it?\u2019 \u2018Cause that\u2019s not what we were making it for.\u201d\n\nWhat did you think of that scene in SATC 2? Let us know @BritandCo.\n\n(photo via Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau)", "images": ["https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/relationships_header.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://bourbon.britcdn.com/assets/menu-icon.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Style_Content-Hub_1920x260_v4_lighter-version.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Issues_header_1920x5001.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://components.britcdn.com/assets/images/logo.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cynthia-Nixon.jpg?auto=format&q=50", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/beauty_1024.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cynthia-Nixon1.jpg", "https://components.britcdn.com/assets/images/logo_condensed.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/food_header.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/home_header_1920x500.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://bourbon.britcdn.com/assets/x-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cynthia-Nixon1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree O", "Desir\u00e9e O Is A", "Professional Bohemian", "Who Loves Anything", "Everything Related To The Arts", "Entertainment", "Pop Culture.
