This time, however, it\u2019s not Meghan Markle \u2014 it\u2019s Angelina Jolie.\n\nThe Oscar winner was made an honorary dame by Queen Elizabeth in 2014 in recognition of her humanitarian work. A few years later, she\u2019s representing those royal ties by attending a formal service at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. The event marks the 200th anniversary of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George, which honors nonmilitary service in a foreign country.\n\nAngelina Jolie wore Ralph Russo for the event Photo: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images Angelina Jolie wore Ralph & Russo for the event.

In England to film the sequel to \u201cMaleficent,\u201d the 43-year-old actress and director took style cues from a certain duchess. Her dress \u2014 whose pale color and neckline are Meghan hallmarks \u2014 was designed by Ralph & Russo, the label worn by Prince Harry\u2019s bride-to-be in her engagement photos.\n\nJolie accessorized with matching gloves, a handheld clutch, and a hat, as well as her own Honorary Dame Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George, aka the gold brooch pinned to her dress.\n\nPhoto: Anthony Devlin/AFP/Getty Images Angelina Jolie wore the cross given to her by the queen in 2014.\n\nDoes it hold a candle to Oscar night? Only one (honorary) dame knows for sure.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d28b6583b00003900dac405.jpeg?ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b35371c1a0000cd04ce2e20.jpeg?cache=RJZR3WN8bL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2740243b00004d00dac1bf.jpeg?cache=CGXTISAWUk&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2793b42600004900044301.jpeg?ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d261e983b00004d00dac064.jpeg?cache=DLFVLOLMkV&ops=424_244", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b35371c1a0000cd04ce2e20.jpeg?cache=RJZR3WN8bL&ops=1910_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b3537582000006505b95b5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2399142400001120934ead.jpeg?cache=seNKjTNZbY&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2605b52600004f000440af.jpeg?cache=2ZeGWmX40V&ops=280_280", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d276834240000ff34935418.png?cache=PVMshOSe4W&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2399142400001120934ead.jpeg?cache=seNKjTNZbY&ops=280_280", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ceefc152500005500dbd234.jpeg?cache=uGSKDIrHrq&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b3536d82200006403eeccb9.png?ops=scalefit_100_30_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d27b7a72600004a00044320.jpeg?cache=WFy79Qb8Bp&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2605b52600004f000440af.jpeg?cache=2ZeGWmX40V&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2740243b00004d00dac1bf.jpeg?cache=CGXTISAWUk&ops=280_280", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d27ac613b00004d00dac25f.png?cache=uqVy5UJ4TN&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d28a9bf240000ff349355c3.png?cache=0FlKRxgndu&ops=424_244"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b35371c1a0000cd04ce2e20.jpeg?cache=RJZR3WN8bL&ops=1910_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Donnelly", "Yahoo Lifestyle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/angelina-jolie-channels-meghan-markle-at-royal-event_n_5b353692e4b0f3c2219f2c42", "title": "Angelina Jolie Channels Meghan Markle At Royal Event", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "description": "Jolie also delivered plenty of star power to the proceedings.", "keywords": "Celebrities Style", "og": {"title": "Angelina Jolie Channels Meghan Markle At Royal Event", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b35371c1a0000cd04ce2e20.jpeg?cache=RJZR3WN8bL&ops=1910_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b35371c1a0000cd04ce2e20.jpeg?cache=RJZR3WN8bL&ops=1910_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1910, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/angelina-jolie-channels-meghan-markle-at-royal-event_n_5b353692e4b0f3c2219f2c42", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Jolie also delivered plenty of star power to the proceedings."}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities Style", "section": "Style & Beauty", "published_time": "2018-06-28T19:32:54Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-28T19:32:54Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostLife", "title": "Angelina Jolie Channels Meghan Markle At Royal Event", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b35371c1a0000cd04ce2e20.jpeg?cache=RJZR3WN8bL&ops=1910_1000", "width": 1910, "height": 1000}, "description": "Jolie also delivered plenty of star power to the proceedings."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b353692e4b0f3c2219f2c42", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "style"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530214374.0, "source": "https://www.huffpost.com", "summary": ""}
