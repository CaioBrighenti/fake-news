The 29-year-old actor invited Vogue to an exclusive barbecue, where he grilled some burgers while answering questions such as: \u201cIf you could change your name, what would you change your name to?\u201d (Khaleesi, natch) and \u201cIs it true you once swam with wild sharks?\u201d (it\u2019s true). He also indulged in a little nostalgia and picked his favorite High School Musical moment.\n\nOne of the most unexpected revelations was the weirdest thing he\u2019s ever done on set: \u201cOne time I tackled Macy Grey in my underwear. And it was improv, so she wasn\u2019t expecting it.\u201d (And we bet she\u2019s never forgotten it either.)\n\nAs for his dream love scene partner, Efron was quick to answer, saying, \u201cThe Rock.\u201d The two already shared an on-screen kiss in Baywatch, which is why the actor added, \u201cFinish what we started.\u201d\n\nHe also said that if his life were a musical, it would be called Zac-a-licious (fab!) \u2014 but that\u2019s nothing compared to his favorite High School Musical moment.\n\nAfter starring in the popular franchise\u2019s three hit films (though not in the subsequent spinoff), Efron obviously has a hard time picking just one fond memory. (He claims the entire experience was his favorite.) However, he eventually narrowed it down to one moment that was the culmination of the entire ride. \u201cI mean, the finale, when the curtains close, tears me up.\u201d (We know the feeling! *sniff*)\n\nAnyone else suddenly in the mood to watch HSM?\n\nWhat was your favorite part of Zac Efron\u2019s \u201c73 Questions\u201d interview?
