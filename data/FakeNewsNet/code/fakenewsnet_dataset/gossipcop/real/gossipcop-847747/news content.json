So it was no surprise that the night was filled with dramatic dresses and seriously cool silhouettes.\n\nRELATED: Met Gala 2016: Kate Hudson, Beyonc\u00e9 and beyond\n\nJennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez lit up the red carpet by making their first public appearance as a couple. For the occasion, Lopez chose a Valentino gown in subtle robin's egg blue. The flowing cape sleeves played into the night's theme in a very JLo way.\n\nLopez's winged eyeliner and voluminous hairstyle added to the vintage vibe of the ensemble.

Bundchen wore a slinky, silver Stella McCartney sheath with ab-baring cutouts and an open back, while Brady wore a matching gunmetal gray tuxedo with a shawl lapel.\n\nThe handsome couple smiled as they strut their stuff on the red carpet! Neilson Barnard / Getty Images\n\nKaty Perry, another co-chair, leaned into the theme with an ornate Maison Margiela ensemble.\n\nThe (literal) head-to-toe red dress featured layers of detail, and the entire look was topped off with a dramatic headdress shrouding her face in veil of tulle.\n\nThe singer was almost unrecognizable in her dramatic getup. Neilson Barnard / Getty Images\n\nIt was a big night for A-list couples, and Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively did not disappoint!\n\nThe pair looked like the king and queen of fashion prom, with Reynolds matching his bright blue bow tie to the feathered hem of Lively's stunning Atelier Versace gown.\n\nLively and Reynolds are no strangers to a red carpet moment, and last night was no exception!
