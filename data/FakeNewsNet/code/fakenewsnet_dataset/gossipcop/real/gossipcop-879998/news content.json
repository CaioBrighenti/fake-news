Just last week, on August 4, Chip took to Twitter to shut down rumors that he and Joanna are getting divorced, as reported by Country Living.\n\nIn response to a fan who tweeted, \"I'm so sick of these 'stories' claiming @joannagaines and @chippergaines breaking up,\" Chip replied with three strong words: \"Won't ever happen ... you can take that to the bank! #loveOfMyLife.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time the \"Fixer Upper\" stars had to address tabloid gossip this year.\n\nBack in April, Joanna denied rumors that she was leaving HGTV to start a line of face creams. \"If you're reading big, exciting news about us, and we did not confirm it on our official sites, then proceed with caution,\" she warned in a blog post.\n\nJust a few months later, however, Joanna had to shut down yet another round of rumors that claimed she was leaving \"Fixer Upper\" to start her own skin care and makeup line. \"This is a SCAM,\" Joanna wrote in an Instagram post.

But it's like everything we care about, everything that's important to us \u2014 we know it's going to require work.\"", "images": ["https://amp.insider.com/images/5810f8ea3a965a1f008b4702-750-500.jpg", "https://amp.insider.com/images/598c9df218b69841008b4a67-750-375.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.insider.com/images/598c9df218b69841008b4a67-750-375.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucy Yang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/fixer-upper-star-chip-gaines-responds-to-divorce-rumors-2017-8", "title": "Chip Gaines used 3 simple words to shut down rumors that he and Joanna are getting divorced", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.insider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#111111", "date": "2017-08-10", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-10", "news_keywords": "Fixer Upper, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Rumors, HGTV, Design, Relationships, Celebrities, Lucy Yang", "sailthru.tags": "Fixer Upper, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Rumors, HGTV, Design, Relationships, Celebrities, Lucy Yang", "description": "For Chip and Joanna, who have been happily married for 14 years, their relationship and their family come first \u2014 no matter how successful they get.", "sailthru.description": "For Chip and Joanna, who have been happily married for 14 years, their relationship and their family come first \u2014 no matter how successful they get.", "title": "Chip Gaines used 3 simple words to shut down rumors that he and Joanna are getting divorced", "sailthru.verticals": "design, culture, people", "sailthru.title": "Chip Gaines used 3 simple words to shut down rumors that he and Joanna are getting divorced", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/598c9df218b69841008b4a67-750-375.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.insider.com/images/598c9e0218b69845008b4a6d-750-563.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.insider.com/images/598c9e0218b69845008b4a6d-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Design", "sailthru.author": "Lucy Yang", "og": {"title": "Chip Gaines used 3 simple words to shut down rumors that he and Joanna are getting divorced", "description": "For Chip and Joanna, who have been happily married for 14 years, their relationship and their family come first \u2014 no matter how successful they get.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thisisinsider.com/fixer-upper-star-chip-gaines-responds-to-divorce-rumors-2017-8", "image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/598c9df218b69841008b4a67-750-375.jpg", "site_name": "INSIDER"}, "author": "Lucy Yang", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.insider.com/fixer-upper-star-chip-gaines-responds-to-divorce-rumors-2017-8", "title": "Chip Gaines used 3 simple words to shut down rumors that he and Joanna are getting divorced", "description": "For Chip and Joanna, who have been happily married for 14 years, their relationship and their family come first \u2014 no matter how successful they get.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.insider.com/images/598c9df218b69841008b4a67-750-375.jpg", "creator": "@lucylyang", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "INSIDER": "Snapchat", "Chip Gaines used 3 simple words to shut down rumors that he and Joanna are getting divorced": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502337600.0, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
