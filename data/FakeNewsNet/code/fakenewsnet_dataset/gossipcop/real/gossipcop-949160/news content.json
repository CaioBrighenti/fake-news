However, a spokesperson confirmed that officers from the Child Abuse and Sexual Offenses Command are investigating six separate, male-on-male alleged sexual assaults that match the three dates published by TMZ, as well as three dates previously connected to Spacey.\n\nImage zoom Kevin Spacey Frazer Harrison/BAFTA LA/Getty Images\n\nSpacey\u2019s attorney did not immediately return PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey had previously made inappropriate sexual advances toward him when he was just 14 years old.\n\nIn response, Spacey, now 58, issued a statement on Twitter addressing the allegations and coming out as gay.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I\u2019m beyond horrified to hear his story,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.\u201d\n\nSeveral more people accused the actor of sexual harassment or assault since, and in April, one sexual assault case against the star reported to have taken place in October of 1992 in West Hollywood involving a male adult was turned over to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office for further review.\n\nIn November, the actor entered a treatment facility. He has not been out in public since and has been written off the finale season of House of Cards.\n\nOn Tuesday, actor Guy Pearce hinted at an unpleasant experience while working with Spacey.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 Tough one to talk about at the moment,\u201d he said on Australian talk show host Andrew Denton\u2019s Interview, according to Independent. \u201cAmazing actor; incredible actor. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He\u2019s a handsy guy.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kevin-spacey1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/claudia-oshry-split.jpg",
