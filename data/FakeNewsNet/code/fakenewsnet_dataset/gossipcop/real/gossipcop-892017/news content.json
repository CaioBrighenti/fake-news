She is kind, loving and she is sweet and very compassionate. I think she works extremely hard, I think she just needs to step back a moment, and take some time and get healthy and take time for her so she can heal.\u201d\n\nHowever, Abraham told PEOPLE in a statement Monday, that her mother\u2019s comments were was very hurtful and she was \u201csad to hear my own mother would say these untrue things about her own child.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s evil and alarming.
