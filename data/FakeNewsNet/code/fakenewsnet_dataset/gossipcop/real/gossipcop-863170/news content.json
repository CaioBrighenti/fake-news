The network told us they don\u2019t want to show Ryan as a recovering addict,\u201d Mackenzie told E! News on Friday, claiming that MTV \u201cdid want to enter a contract with our unborn baby and have the baby film with Ryan\u2019s parents so it would look like someone else is raising it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to want to talk about us but they don\u2019t want to pay us and film us,\u201d Ryan remarked, alleging that even though he\u2019s sober now, his ex Maci Bookout \u2014 and fellow Teen Mom OG star \u2014 told MTV \u201cshe\u2019s not going to film unless I enter rehab again and quit the show.\u201d\n\nThe couple announced earlier this year that they are pregnant with their first child. Additionally, Ryan has 9-year-old son Bentley with Bookout, while Mackenzie has 4-year-old son Hudson with ex Zachary Stephens.\n\nImage zoom Mackenzie Standifer Edwards and Ryan Edwards Mackenzie Edwards/Instagram\n\nEdwards also spoke out against MTV on Friday as he shared a powerful message about addiction on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI will never stop speaking out against this horrible disease! It consumes your life and turns you into someone even you don\u2019t know. I\u2019m asking you to never give up. Each day is a struggle. I\u2019ve made mistakes and I have really messed up in the past but there is so much hope ahead and it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t change the future,\u201d Edwards wrote.\n\nDiscussing the way he and his wife might be portrayed on the upcoming season of the reality show, he added: \u201cDon\u2019t take everything you see on MTV as factual truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to show me or Mack in a happy light or that I am active in my recovery. I AM,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey want me to look angry, passive aggressive and uncaring regarding things that mean the most to me. I\u2019m done taking their s\u2014 and letting the world believe this by standing up for myself. You\u2019re believing a lie. And soon\u2026 very, very soon, you WILL see the TRUTH behind the LIAR.\u201d\n\nThe reality TV pair secretly tied the knot before Ryan headed to rehab back in May 2017 and exchanged vows at a church ceremony that November.\n\n\u201cA little over 30 days ago, I made the decision to check myself into a rehabilitation facility. I am back home now doing well, and life could not be better,\u201d he said in a statement at the time. \u201cWithout the support of my wife and parents I would not have been able to do this. Thank you all for your well wishes.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Teen Mom OG\u2019s Mackenzie Standifer Edwards Confirms She\u2019s Expecting a Child with Ryan Edwards\n\nNews of their departure came just hours

stood in the background.\n\n\u201cI am excited to join MTV\u2019s \u2018Teen Mom OG.\u2019 I look forward to sharing my experiences and hope that I can help others on their journey,\u201d she captioned the post.\n\nFormer cast member Farrah Abraham left the show earlier this year after settling a lawsuit against MTV\u2019s parent company Viacom in March for an undisclosed amount.",
