The pair had entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave.\n\nPolice said Lesseps slammed a door and kicked at least one officer. \u201cOfficer O\u2019Leary then attempted to detain De Lesseps and remove her from the bathroom, at which time De Lesseps shoved Officer O\u2019Leary with an open palm to the chest, then slammed the door on Officer O\u2019Leary face, striking him in the forehead. While De Lesseps was being placed in handcuffs she resisted by pushing and pulling away from Officer O\u2019Leary and I,\u201d the police report stated.\n\nImage zoom AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nShe was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office. She pleaded not guilty to the charges and a hearing is set for April.\n\nAfter her arrest, de Lesseps \u2014 who had gotten married to ex-husband Tom D\u2019Agostino in Palm Beach on last New Year\u2019s Eve before their divorce seven months later \u2014 released a statement saying, \u201cThis was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.\u201d\n\nShe also checked herself into an alcohol treatment facility.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to not take yourself so damn seriously,\u201d de Lesseps told The Times. \u201cI always think, \u2018I can survive this if I keep on moving.\u2019 \u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/luann-de-lesseps-1.jpg",
