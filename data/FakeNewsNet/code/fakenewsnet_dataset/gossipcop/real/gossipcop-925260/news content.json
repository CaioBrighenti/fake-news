On Monday, the singer held a slumber party with three of her closest pals, and in true bestie fashion (pun intended), they all wore matching millennial pink pajamas. The friends in question are Theresa Mingus, Paige Reed, and Rebeka Walters, and Paige and Rebeka both gave fans a glimpse of the night by posting the same pic to social media.\n\nIn the photo, the four friends are giving us major Dua Lipa \"New Rules\" vibes as they do an impromptu photo shoot in a massive bed. Theresa defies gravity on the top of the headboard, as Paige, Rebeka, and Selena all strike sisterly poses on the mattress. Selena, whose new Puma collection will be released on Friday, even accessorizes with a pair of thigh-high ballet pink stockings by the brand. (It's unclear if they ended up replicating the \"New Rules\" hair-brushing train like they did in Riverdale.)\n\nFor those of us wondering where we can snag those adorable PJ sets for throwing a Selena-esque sleepover of our own, luckily, Paige came through with the answer. In the Instagram comments, she wrote, \"target!!! They are so comfy.\" The pajama sets in question are the \"Women's Pajama Set Total Comfort\" by Gilligan & O'Malley in \"Pom Pom Pink.\" Unlike lots of celeb-endorsed clothing, these are neither sold out nor expensive, retailing at $19.99. The perfect outfit for a night in with your besties.\n\nRelated: Selena Gomez Wore Her Pajamas Out, Is a Hero\n\nCheck this out:", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ac3cda88616482b0189c087/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/_Lede.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d23b6eec5785300095f531d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ST3-Production-Still-8.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d05343029cbad14799097dc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/promo-image-selena-gomez-style.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5cfffe24c546b66ec8b20013/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Amazon%2520Staples_Story.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d24bd64dcf69700082599bd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-hair-color.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d238b1ed4b4d600086398ed/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Celeb%2520Roundup_7.8_Story.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d28e0fd84233d0008195341/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Celeb%2520Roundup_7.12_Story.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d0b9da9501fc3d29e4c4ae7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Luke%2520Perry_Hero.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ac3cda96716f1799c9919a3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/_FB.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d03e42ccbf906a6517c4b12/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Celeb%2520Fash%2520Roundup_6.14_Story.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ac3cda96716f1799c9919a3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/_FB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Tatum Dooley", "Kara Nesvig", "Lauren Rearick", "Bianca Nieves", "Emily Wan", "Sara Radin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-sleepover-matching-pjs", "title": "Selena Gomez and Her Friends Wore Matching $20 Target Pajamas", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Selena Gomez threw a sleepover with three of her friends, getting them matching pink pajamas for a Dua Lipa in the \"New Rules\" video vibe.", "keywords": "snd,selena gomez,sleepover,pajamas", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "My invite must have gotten lost in the mail.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ac3cda96716f1799c9919a3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/_FB.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Selena Gomez and Her Friends Matched in $20 Pajamas", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-sleepover-matching-pjs"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "My invite must have gotten lost in the mail.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ac3cda96716f1799c9919a3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/_FB.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Selena Gomez and Her Friends Matched in $20 Pajamas"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311, "admins": 108943}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
