He bought it for a mere \u00a315,000 four years later with his French Polynesian wife, Tarita.\n\nFollowing his death in 2004, it was turned into The Brando, a luxurious eco-resort costing from \u00a33,000 a night.\n\nIts 35 thatched villas each have an outdoor bath, an infinity pool and a rocking chair for two, with seawater air-conditioning, solar electricity and generators running on coconut oil.\n\nOn Saturday night, the new Mr and Mrs James Matthews pulled out all the stops to give their guests a night they'd never forget.\n\nPhotos revealed how hundreds of VIP guests watched as footage of Pippa and her billionaire hedge fund manager husband was beamed onto the back of her family's \u00a36million Berkshire mansion in a dazzling display during the reception.\n\nThe newlyweds' faces were projected onto the windows of Bucklebury Manor along with psychedelic lights and, at one point, what appeared to be the silhouette of a shapely dancing woman against a green background.\n\nAt one point James was shown in his hunting gear - an apparent nod to his lengthy campaign to win the affections of his bride - as guests partied until 4am.\n\nIt is thought that Pippa and James will arrive today at Tetiaroa, a two-and-a-half square mile necklace of coral islets encircling a crystal-clear lagoon\n\nAtoll Idyll: Tetiaroa was once owned by Marlon Brando and his Polynesian wife Tarita, his co-star in the film Mutiny On The Bounty\n\nEco Luxury: The resort\u2019s most expensive villa, which is 2,648 sq ft, has three bedrooms \u2013 and costs an eye-watering \u00a310,000 a night. It comes with a 236 sq ft pool\n\nTaking the plunge: Newlyweds Pippa and James can swim among turtles in a spectacular lagoon or lounge in their own pool\n\nMarried Bliss: The Brando\u2019s villas all have king-size beds and overlook coconut trees and a pristine white beach. Each villa has been decorated in a tasteful style to match the stunning surroundings of the island\n\nPippa wore a stunning Giles Deacon gown to wed hedge fund manager James Matthews at St Mark's Church on Saturday\n\nAfter the formality of the ceremony at St Mark's Church in Englefield, guests including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and his girlfriend Meghan Markle, and tennis ace Roger Federer danced the night away until 4am at the magnificent glass marquee erected at the Middleton estate for the occasion.\n\nThe pictures also capture the elaborate lighting in place inside the marquee, attendees had enjoyed a lavish meal before watching a Spitfire flypast to celebrate Pippa and James' marriage as dusk fell over the Berkshire countryside.\n\nMs Markle did not make an appearance at the church service on Saturday morning, but Prince Harry later slipped away from proceedings to collect his partner, and the pair were snapped discreetly making their way into the reception by car.\n\nThey reportedly sat apart during the evening event lavishly staged in a glass marquee at the Middleton family home in the Berkshire village of Bucklebury.\n\nBut her appearance will encourage the belief held by many royal watchers that the Queen's grandson will pop the question to his partner.\n\nPippa and James exchanged vows at St Mark's Church in Englefield, before heading to the bride's family home in a vintage Jag for a spectacular party with their nearest and dearest.\n\nIn addition to Pippa's royal relatives, high profile guests included Princess Eugenie, Donna Air, the girlfriend of her brother James, Vogue contributor Serena Hood, and tennis ace Roger Federer and his wife.\n\nPippa's sister the Duchess of Cambridge helped to make sure her big day went off without a hitch, shepherding the adorable page boys and flower girls - including Prince George and Princess Charlotte, and perfecting the bride's train before she swept down the aisle.\n\nThe bride and groom's faces were beamed onto the windows of the mansion on repeat for hundreds of guests to see\n\nSpectacular floral displays and banquette style seating heaped with green cushions were visible inside the temporary venue\n\nGuests at Pippa and James's wedding enjoyed a spectacular Spitfire flypast as dusk fell in Berkshire on Saturday evening\n\nA smiling Prince Harry drove his girlfriend Meghan Markle to the evening reception just in time for the Spitfire flypast\n\nPrince William and Harry were both at the ceremony - Prince Harry later slipped away to pick up his girlfriend Meghan Markle, who joined the reception later in the evening", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/07/12/00/15943700-0-image-a-25_1562887686347.jpg",
