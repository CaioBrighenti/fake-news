The fifth episode of season 9 of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d revealed that she left the Hilltop with the mysterious Georgie during the big time jump that came at the end of Rick Grimes\u2019 final episode.\n\nAnd it turns out that may have also been Maggie\u2019s final episode ever. Clearly, the creatives on the show and the folks at AMC are hedging their bets by not killing her off. But it\u2019s entirely possible she\u2019ll never appear on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d ever again.\n\nWe had heard rumblings of Cohan\u2019s exit from the series all year, following stories of a contentious contract dispute in which Cohan wanted equal pay with other longtime series regulars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus. After signing on to ABC\u2019s \u201cWhiskey Cavalier,\u201d which will debut mid-season, Cohan did say she would be able to come back to \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d for at least part of Season 9.\n\nAlso Read: 'Walking Dead': Everything We Know, and Think We Know, About Georgie\n\nBut that part of the season is now over, as \u201cTWD\u201d showrunner Angela Kang has confirmed that they don\u2019t have plans for her to appear again in Season 9. And on the episode of \u201cTalking Dead\u201d after the season 9 mid-season finale, Chris Hardwicke read a statement from the producers which re-confirmed that Cohan won\u2019t be back this season but that \u201cMaggie\u2019s story is not done\u201d and that they \u201chope to have her back\u201d at some point in the future.\n\nLauren Cohan addressed the situation again recently in similarly ambiguous terms, saying that \u201cthere may have been some conversations\u201d about her return to \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d but that we\u2019ll have have to wait and \u201csee what happens.\u201d\n\nThat all probably felt like it was coming totally out of left field, considering how Maggie did not get any kind of real sendoff. Her final (as far as we know) episode also being Rick\u2019s last didn\u2019t help, since the episode basically functioned as Rick\u2019s death episode.\n\nBut what AMC is doing with Rick may also be the path for wrapping up Maggie\u2019s story. Two weeks ago, at the end of their final episode, Rick ended up being airlifted by helicopter away from Virginia, and what happens to him wherever he ends up will be the subject of a series of movies.\n\nAlso Read: Here's What You Need to Know About That Talking Zombie on 'The Walking Dead'\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s long been theorized that the helicopter belongs to the same group that Georgie hails from \u2014 the Commonwealth, an actual large city of people in Ohio. If that theory pans out, and Georgie\u2019s people are also the helicopter\u2019s people, then there\u2019s plenty of reason for Rick and Maggie to cross paths in this new corner of the \u201cWalking Dead\u201d universe.\n\nBut everything remains shrouded in mystery, and it sounds like nobody involved actually knows at this time what Maggie\u2019s fate will end up being. If Georgie actually is with the Commonwealth, then the subject of Maggie is going to have to come up again sooner or later \u2014 the Commonwealth is the next big storyline in the comics after the Whisperer War that is about to begin on the show.\n\nAlso Read: Apocalypse Not Yet?

Maggie is so important that her fate will have to be dealt with at some point in the next couple seasons of \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d even if Lauren Cohan never comes back.\n\nJust don\u2019t expect closure any time soon.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spider-man-far-from-home-DF-06693_r.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fast-and-furious-every-car-ranked-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DogTheBountyHunter-1-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-walking-dead-twd-talking-zombies-whisperers-jesus-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChloeDan-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-5.59.05-PM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/the-walking-dead-twd-leaders-ranked-negan-jadis-governor-rick.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TWD_901_JLD_0503_2572_RT-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-walking-dead-magnas-group-new-survivors-nadia-hilker-judith-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-walking-dead-twd-jadis-helicopter-rick-grimes-andrew-lincoln-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/envelope.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-108340929-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-walking-dead-twd-lauren-cohan-are-we-ever-gonna-see-maggie-again.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CMS_EW_061919_Comedy618x742-1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070919_Whitman_Quibi_1092px.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1153289783-1-e1562700127279.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2F5A0156.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/the-walking-dead-twd-lauren-cohan-are-we-ever-gonna-see-maggie-again.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Phil Owen", "Tony Maglio", "Ross A.
