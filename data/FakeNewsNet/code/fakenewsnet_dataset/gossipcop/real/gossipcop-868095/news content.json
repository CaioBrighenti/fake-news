But rarely does it make a food magazine website's headline news. Until now! Because Prince William and Duchess Kate have added a twist to their travels\u2014and a salty one at that.\n\nAfter their arrival in Germany, the royal couple were treated to a class in hand-rolling pretzels at a market in Heidelberg, because if you went to Germany and didn't learn how to make a pretzel, what's the point? Dressed in a bright yellow Jenny Packham lace dress and a golden-pretzel-branded apron, Kate dove right in, while it took Wills a bit longer to catch on. Has she made pretzels (a complicated, days long, sort of dangerous process that can involve lye) before? Probably not, but she was rolling with the best of them.\n\nIt seemed everyone, including the many spectators and local bakers who came to help/watch, had a great time laughing and rolling, rolling and laughing, clapping for Prince William when he finally was able to untangle himself from the dough and present his carb-filled masterpiece. It was a photo op, after all. The couple later got a lesson in making candy, which seemed to fare a bit better. See below for Prince William and Kate Middleton Prepare Local Foods: a story in four parts.\n\nChris Jackson - Pool/Getty Images\n\nFrom the start, you can see the look in Prince William's eyes that says: Oh no. I'm not wearing the right hat for this.", "images": ["https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b543bb08317780071a6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-819298812.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/5cf69e4451e401e8293d3d02/16:9/w_800%2Cc_limit/HR-soft-swerve.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57bf2e266a6acdf3485df71f/16:9/w_800%2Cc_limit/queen-cake-1989.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b543942a20318cc3be3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-819302118.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/pretzels.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b543bb08317780071a7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-819298996.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57afb98ff1c801a1038bd396/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ba-party-mix.jpg", "https://www.bonappetit.com/verso/static/bon-appetit/assets/logo-header.29b3f7bcdadf3b208a05a3ab761757ab663c1e12.svg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b543942a20318cc3be4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-819298624.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/5ce6e16556f1827055eb2f60/16:9/w_800%2Cc_limit/Basically-Cheesy-Broccoli.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57afba7e1b33404414975e3c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/everything-cookies.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretzels.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57ad567053e63daf11a4de1e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/man-bun.jpg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/57af73171b33404414975dc9/16:9/w_800%2Cc_limit/sweet-pretzels.jpg", "https://www.bonappetit.com/verso/static/bon-appetit/assets/logo-reverse.adafbb9b583b565c29b99cfbd36ab80f108eac59.svg", "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/5d2634546d1b83000884920b/16:9/w_800%2Cc_limit/HLY-Eaton-DC.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretzels.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Elyssa Goldberg", "Alex Beggs", "Elyse Inamine", "Carla Lalli Music", "Melissa Minto", "Sarah Jampel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bonappetit.com/story/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-pretzels", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Hand-Rolled Pretzels in Germany", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "During their recent royal trip to Germany, Prince William and Duchess Kate Middleton learned from local bakers how to prepare pretzels.", "keywords": "snd,royals", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "As one does.", "image": "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretzels.jpg", "site_name": "Bon App\u00e9tit", "title": "Prince William and Kate Middleton Rolled Pretzels in Germany", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bonappetit.com/story/kate-middleton-and-prince-william-pretzels"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As one does.", "domain": "https://www.bonappetit.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/59710b549989ab38ffaebc60/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretzels.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@bonappetit", "title": "Prince William and Kate Middleton Rolled Pretzels in Germany"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2309869772, "pages": 37940325366}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bonappetit.com", "summary": ""}
