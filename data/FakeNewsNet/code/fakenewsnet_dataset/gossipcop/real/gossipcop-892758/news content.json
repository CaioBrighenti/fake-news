{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(Ed_Sheeran_song)", "text": "\"Perfect\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran from his third studio album, \u00f7 (2017).[1] After the album's release it charted at number four on the UK Singles Chart.[2] On 21 August 2017, Billboard announced that \"Perfect\" would be the fourth single from the album.[3] The song was serviced to pop radio on 26 September 2017, as the third single from the album in the United States (fourth overall).[4] The song eventually reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100 in December 2017. \"Perfect\" became the UK Christmas number-one song for 2017, and also peaked at number one in sixteen other countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand.\n\nThe second version of the single, titled \"Perfect Duet\", with American singer Beyonc\u00e9 was released on 1 December 2017.[5] Another duet with Italian singer Andrea Bocelli, titled \"Perfect Symphony\", was released on 15 December 2017.[6] The song and its official music video received three nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nComposition and production [ edit ]\n\n\"Perfect\" was the first track Sheeran wrote for his third studio album \u00f7.[7] The song is a romantic ballad written about his girlfriend Cherry Seaborn, whom he knew from school and reconnected with when she was working in New York.[8][9] Sheeran revealed that the inspiration for the lyrics came after visiting James Blunt's house in Ibiza, where the two singers had listened to the rapper Future's music at six in the morning.[10] He said: \"Barefoot on the grass, dancing to our favorite song, which happened to be Future's \"March Madness\"... I booked the studio for the day, and I had that and I was like, right, let me just flesh that out. And the song happened and was sort of finished that day. I knew it was special.\"[10][11]\n\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe, Sheeran said that he needed to write the best love song of his career with \"Perfect\". He said: \"I need to do it 100% me, so everyone will listen to that will be like, \"Ah! He can actually do it!\" ... I wanted to beat \"Thinking Out Loud\", 'cause I know that song was going to define me.\"[10] He also produced the song himself with help from Will Hicks, and strings orchestration from his brother Matthew Sheeran.[10] This is the first time the brothers had collaborated on a song as it was the final wish of their grandmother to see the brothers working together before she died.\n\nThe song is written in the key of A\u266d major (G major in live performances) with a tempo of 63,5 beats per minute in 12\n\n8 time (if not using triplets) or 4\n\n4 time (if using triplets). \"Perfect\" moves at a chord progression of A\u266d5\u2013Fm7\u2013D\u266dsus2\u2013E\u266d.
