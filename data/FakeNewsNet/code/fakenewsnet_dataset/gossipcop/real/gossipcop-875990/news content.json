Now ain't dat a b*tch pic.twitter.com/B8h8T2yugR \u2014 Peachy \ud83c\udf51 (@bitchboybye) August 25, 2017\n\nI don't know how I feel about the Taylor Swift/Donda West thing but if it's real, it's horrendous, and also I don't understand people who \u2014 water? i hardly know her!\ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udda4 (@bornxhowling) August 25, 2017\n\n>Death of Donda West- Nov 10\n\n>Release date of Taylor Swift's Reputation- Nov 10 I dabble in pop culture pettiness for fun but this\u2026\u2026 \u2014 Tim@\ud83c\udf57\ud83e\udd6b\ud83e\udd57U NAAAME IT \ud83e\udd54\ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf56 (@T1mco) August 25, 2017\n\nwhy are ppl acting like taylor swift would intentionally release an album on the anniversary of donda west to get to kanye??? \u2014 halfway happy (@betweenjoy) August 25, 2017\n\nThat Taylor Swift x donda west conspiracy is such a reach lmfaoo. Y'all giving t-swizzle too much credit when she's not THAT creative \u2014 Los (@RichHomieChapo) August 25, 2017\n\nAs soon as \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d was released, fans reacted to the specific lyrics \u201cI don\u2019t like your little games / I don\u2019t like your tilted stage,\u201d saying it was a reference to West.\n\nThough Swift doesn\u2019t mention him by name in the song, the rapper used a tilted stage while on his Saint Pablo tour.\n\nThe lyrics \u201cI don\u2019t like your kingdom keys / They once belonged to me\u201d could also be a reference to West\u2019s album with JAY-Z, titled Watch the Throne. In a sneak peek of Swift\u2019s music video, she can be seen sitting on a throne with the words \u201cET TU BRUTE\u201d etched onto the arm.\n\nLast summer, Swift\u2019s feud with West, 40, exploded after Kim Kardashian West, 36, leaked a phone call between the \u201cShake It Off\u201d singer and her husband on Snapchat. In the edited clips of the call, Swift appeared to give West her blessing over a line referencing her in his song, \u201cFamous.\u201d\n\nHowever, Swift hit back at the couple afterwards on Instagram, saying West never told her he was going to call Swift \u201cthat bitch\u201d in his song. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to control someone\u2019s emotional response to being called \u2018that bitch\u2019 in front of the entire world,\u201d she captioned her post. \u201cHe promised to play the song for me, but he never did.\u201d\n\nSwift and West have had a complicated relationship since 2009, when the rapper interrupted the singer\u2019s best female video acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards. The duo appeared to have patched up their differences and were seen buddying up at the Grammy Awards in 2014 before Swift presented an award to West at the MTV VMAs later that year.", "images":
