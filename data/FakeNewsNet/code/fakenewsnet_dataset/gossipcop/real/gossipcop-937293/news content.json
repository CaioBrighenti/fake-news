Gomez was dressed in all black but managed to sneak a nice little tribute to her good friend Taylor Swift into her ensemble. Fans noticed that Gomez was wearing a Reputation stadium tour sweatshirt\u2014merch from Swift's tour that Gomez made a guest appearance at in May.\n\nThe hoodie is available here on Swift's site:\n\ntaylorswift.com BLACK TOUR HOODIE WITH SNAKE DESIGN tour store.taylorswift.com $45.00 Shop Now\n\nThe outing was Gomez's first since she was reportedly hospitalized twice in the fall because of a low white blood cell count, a common complication for kidney transplant patients. After those incidents, Gomez decided to seek additional treatment for her anxiety and depression at an East Coast facility in October. She's out of treatment now and is \"feeling much better and looking forward to getting back to normalcy,\u201d a source told People yesterday. \u201cShe\u2019s spending time with friends and family.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly's source echoed People's. \u201cSelena is definitely in a healthier place than she was a few months ago,\u201d the source told Us. \u201cIt took lots of energy, focus and therapy to get over that particular hump in her life.\u201d\n\nAnd a separate source told E! that Gomez is \"checking in with professionals as her health battle is ongoing.\" Overall, \"[She] truly is in a much better place. She feels refreshed and is in a better head space.\"\n\nWhile Swift wasn't on the trip this week, Gomez spoke earlier this year about how much her over-a-decade-long friendship with Swift means to her.\n\n\"I have to say thank you to my best friend of about 12 years, almost 13, and the reason why she has been one of my best friends is because this person has never ever judged a single decision I\u2019ve made,\" Gomez told Swift's audience at the Reputation show she performed at. \"She\u2019s always met me where I\u2019ve been. She\u2019s encouraged me when I\u2019ve had nothing to be encouraged about, and I don\u2019t know if I would be as strong as I am if I didn\u2019t have you and your family because you\u2019ve changed my life. And\u2014she\u2019s going to kill me after\u2014but honestly, thank you for the bottom of my heart for supporting someone who I know is the most beautiful, strong, independent woman I\u2019ve ever met. So thank you as a best friend.\"\n\nSelena talking about Taylor tonight at the #ReputationTour (via jordinsilver) pic.twitter.com/CZ7lHQHKXA \u2014 Selena Media (@SelenaMedia) May 20, 2018", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/selena-taylor-gettyimages-960300492-1-1545233537.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1545232778-capture-d-e-cran-2018-12-19-a-10-19-07-am-1545232758.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/selena-taylor-gettyimages-960300492-1-1545233537.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey", "News", "Strategy Editor", "Alyssa Bailey Is The News", "Strategy Editor At Elle.Com", "Where She Oversees Coverage Of Celebrities", "Royals", "Particularly Meghan Markle", "Kate Middleton ."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a25628365/selena-gomez-taylor-swift-tribute-top/", "title": "The Taylor Swift Tribute You Didn't Notice Selena Gomez Was Wearing During Her Snow Tubing Trip", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "The Taylor Swift Tribute You Didn't Notice Selena Gomez Was Wearing During Her Snow Tubing Trip", "description": "This is very sweet.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a25628365/selena-gomez-taylor-swift-tribute-top/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/selena-taylor-gettyimages-960300492-1-1545233537.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-12-19 03:38:40", "published_time": "2018-12-19 03:38:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/selena-taylor-gettyimages-960300492-1-1545233537.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "The Taylor Swift Tribute That Selena Gomez Was Wearing During Her First Appearance Since September", "description": "Selena Gomez made her very first public outing since September yesterday when her friend Connar Franklin shared pictures of Gomez with her and their friends on a snow-tubing trip.
