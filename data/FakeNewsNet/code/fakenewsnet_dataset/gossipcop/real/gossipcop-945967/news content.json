The rapper, 25, recently opened up to Rolling Stone magazine in an interview about her pregnancy and her wild plans for her baby shower .\n\n\"I want a lit baby shower,\" Cardi told the magazine. \"My baby shower's not starting at no 5:00. My s--t is going to start at 9 p.m. because that's how I celebrate, that's how Caribbean people celebrate.\"\n\nShe went on to add that she's planning on celebrating\u2014in a bit of a controversial way. \"I don't like baby showers that be at 5 p.m. in the backyard, eating, cooking hors d'oeuvres. Nah,\" she said. \"S--t, I might even drink some red wine. Red wine's healthy, right?\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the star tweeted more about her plans to celebrate the upcoming birth of her baby. She wrote in a tweet, \"I was planning to have 2 babyshowers ...One in NY and one in Atl but my doctor told me i can't fly nomore...now i have to fly 60 people to Atlanta...I always bragged about having 2 big families until now.\"\n\nSee more: Cardi B Spilled the Details on Her Potential Wedding Dress, and It's Not What You'd Expect\n\nThe musician, who is engaged to rapper Offset, previously revealed on SiriusXM\u2019s The Howard Stern Show that she is pregnant with her and Offset's first child together, a baby girl.
