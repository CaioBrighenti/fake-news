Since going off the air in 2006, fans have longed for a return of their favorite witches. And, while the show is coming back to network television, there are a few changes everyone may be surprised with.\n\nAccording to \u201cEntertainment Weekly,\u201d the show is following in the footsteps of popular Netflix series \u201cStranger Things,\u201d and taking a turn back in time to 1976. There\u2019s no official cast yet, but sources say the original cast \u2013 Shannen Doherty, Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs and Rose McGowan \u2013 have not been ruled out for roles on the reboot. But, with the show taking a turn back in time, it\u2019s safe to assume the original cast may not be as heavily involved as we\u2019d hope. Milano told \u201cThe Daily Beast\u201d that CBS had tried to reboot the show without any of the original cast, but instead focused on a prequel to the show. The reboot will take place on The CW, which is the same network the original show aired.\n\nWhile there aren\u2019t many details about the cast or when the show will air, seeing as it\u2019s still in the script-writing stage, fans are pretty stoked to get a touch of magic back on their TV screens.\n\nA CHARMED REBOOT IS OFFICIALLY COMING pic.twitter.com/CiqPle2xFk \u2014 jennifer (@kepswizzle) November 26, 2017\n\nFinally a reboot for Charmed on the Cw. \u2014 mark parisi (@markparisipvt) November 24, 2017\n\nI literally spoke a charmed reboot into existence and I couldn't be happier \u2014 LP\u263d\u263c (@lexypaim) November 19, 2017\n\nA Charmed Reboot YES PLEASE! ? \u2014 Chris ??
