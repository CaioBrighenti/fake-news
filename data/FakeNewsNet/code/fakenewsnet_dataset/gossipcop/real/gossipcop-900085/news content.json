And thank Jacob, because Hulu has made that possible.\n\nAll six seasons of Lost are now available to stream on Hulu, which is great news for people who were bummed to learn that the twisty philosophical drama was leaving Netflix, where it has lived since its run ended in 2010, in the new year. So, there\u2019s no need to worry: J.J. Abrams\u2019 polar bear-inhabited mystery box of an island will be there waiting for you, whether you\u2019re visiting it for the first time or the tenth.\n\nOriginally airing from 2004-2010, Lost followed the survivors of Oceanic Air flight 815, which crashed on an uncharted island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. As the show unfolded, Dr. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), fugitive Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), and the other castaways learned that there was more to this island than initially meets the eye. The series, which was created by Abrams, Damon Lindelof, and Jeffrey Lieber, won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in its first season.\n\nAs Netflix has moved away from being the home of beloved old shows, Hulu has stepped up to pick up the slack. Its library also includes Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The X-Files, Community, and many more.\n\nWatch all 121 episodes of Lost on Hulu now.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/1568-angel_1200x6282.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/000209014.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/angel2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/euphoria-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/000209014.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3e01c569b1a2f915fee2b91af28de8a8?s=300&d=blank&r=g"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/000209014.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chancellor Agard"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/04/lost-streaming-hulu/", "title": "Lost is available on Hulu after leaving Netflix", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Lost, lost where to stream, where can i stream lost, lost netflix, lost hulu", "news_keywords": "Lost, lost where to stream, where can i stream lost, lost netflix, lost hulu", "description": "We have to go back!
