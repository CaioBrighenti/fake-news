They eventually married and had two children in the fictional relationship.\n\nThough the couple were together when \u201cThe Office\u201d went off air, people have taken umbrage with Fischer\u2019s on-screen romance in her new show, ABC's \u201cSplitting Up Together,\u201d which debuted on Tuesday night.\n\nFischer\u2019s character, Lena, and her husband Martin (played by Oliver Hudson) have split up but are trying to live together while their children still live at home.\n\nBut in the runup to the show\u2019s debut, \u201cThe Office\u201d fans couldn\u2019t support the new romance.\n\nWhy is Pam with someone besides Jim? #splittinguptogether \u2014 Shannon Blosser (@ShannonBlosser) March 5, 2018\n\nNo @jennafischer, I will not support #SplittingUpTogether bc I love Jim/Pam. (I will still watch the show, but I won\u2019t be supporting!!!) \u2639\ufe0f\ud83d\udc93 \u2014 MZ (@MZimbler) March 21, 2018\n\nI genuinely wish the husband in Pam's new show, #SplittingUpTogether, was Jim. Or Roy. Either would be fine. \u2014 Lauren Chval (@lchval) March 5, 2018\n\nPAM WHERE IS JIM #splittinguptogether \u2014 Allie (@AllieJeanson) February 6, 2018\n\nJust saw a commercial for #splittinguptogether and idk if I can watch Pam be with anyone but Jim. Sorry @jennafischer \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u2014 Courtney (@courtneygrooves) February 6, 2018\n\n\u201cSplitting Up Together\u201d even acknowledged the disapproval from fans.\n\nLook, there\u2019s no comparison, fans of #TheOffice . Jim is Jim and Martin is pretty great once you get to know him. Check out @jennafischer\n\n& @theoliverhudson on #SplittingUpTogether Tuesday at 9:30|8:30c on ABC. pic.twitter.com/jaUCy0peFa \u2014 SplittingUpTogether (@SplittingUpABC) March 24, 2018\n\nHudson and Fischer both appeared on the \u201cEllen DeGeneres Show\" and talked about how they\u2019ve both received hatred from fans who can\u2019t let Jim and Pam go, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\"I'm getting hate tweets and everything!\" Hudson confirmed. \"I haven't done anything!\"\n\nIt's time\u2026 time to put all the stress of your day behind you, settle in with a soda pop and some fun dip, watch #SplittingUpTogether tonight at 9:30|8:30c on ABC and probably change the world\u2026 #thenewjim pic.twitter.com/LYEOKC23V0 \u2014 Oliver Hudson (@theoliverhudson) March 27, 2018\n\nThe show\u2019s first episode changed people\u2019s minds about the new hubby, though.\n\nI thought i was gonna be salty seeing Pam be with someone besides Jim but #SplittingUpTogether is pretty good so far \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \u2014 Lindsay McKenna (@lindsmckenna) March 28, 2018\n\nAnd apparently, there was even an uncle Jim character mentioned in the show, which delighted \"Office\" fans.\n\nFischer said on \u201cEllen\u201d last week that if viewers give her new romance a chance, even Jim and Pam fans will approve, though.\n\n\u201cI really think people are going to be won over,\u201d Fischer said, according to The Wrap. \u201cI really do. I think this relationship, people are going to get just as invested in it. I believe in it. And I think that if you \u2014 I know it\u2019s making people angry, but I think they should just hate watch the show. Just hate watch, be mad. And then all of a sudden you\u2019re gonna fall in love.\u201d\n\nJim and Pam holdouts may soon get their day in the sun. Rumors suggest a revival of \"The Office\" is still in the works. Krasinski said he would love to return to the show, but hasn\u2019t heard anything yet.\n\nIn somewhat related news, Toby from \u201cThe Office\u201d suffered some blame for a nor\u2019easter that ravaged through the East Coast last week.", "images": ["https://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/weather/2006/11/30/17367251/webwx-DMID1-5jg8im1v6-220x123.jpg",
