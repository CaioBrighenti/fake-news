The project was originally slated to be NBC\u2019s holiday musical event for winter 2017 but was pushed to 2018 last May because of Lopez\u2019s schedule.\n\nLopez is shooting two movies later this year, plus she has a host of other commitments to NBC. She\u2019s the exec producer and a judge on the Peacock\u2019s summer unscripted series \u201cWorld of Dance,\u201d and she stars in the police drama \u201cShades of Blue.\u201d On top of her film and TV work, Lopez is committed to finishing the last lap of her Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in September.\n\nNBC is gearing up for the ambitious April 1 live staging of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\u201d with the hope of drawing a big crowd on Easter Sunday. That production has also complicated planning for \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d because it is being shepherded by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, the executive producers behind all of NBC\u2019s live musicals to date. By the time the work on \u201cSuperstar\u201d is finished, the producers would have less than six months to get \u201cBirdie\u201d on its feet if the show were to stick with its targeted December airdate.\n\nMoreover, NBC\u2019s live musicals are a big investment for the Peacock. The elaborate staging plan for \u201cSuperstar\u201d involves a company of 70-plus actors and musicians and an audience of 1,300 at Brooklyn\u2019s Marcy Armory. Pulling off two large-scale legit live events in the same year would probably be a budget-buster for the network.\n\nBut with \u201cBirdie\u201d moving again, it\u2019s understood that there is an effort under way to come up with a project to fill the void rather than have NBC go two years in a row without a live holiday event. But it\u2019s unclear whether the projects under consideration would have the same scope as NBC\u2019s past productions.\n\nNBC\u2019s four previous live events \u2014 2013\u2019s \u201cThe Sound of Music Live,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201cPeter Pan Live,\u201d 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Wiz Live,\u201d and 2016\u2019s \u201cHairspray Live\u201d \u2014 all aired in early December. This past December, Fox moved into the void with a tuner production of \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d that drew mixed reviews and modest ratings.\n\nNBC has also been working on plans for a live staging of the Aaron Sorkin play \u201cA Few Good Men.\u201d That project, also exec produced by Zadan and Meron, is unlikely to surface before 2019. Sorkin\u2019s awards-season schedule with the film \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d which marked his feature directorial debut, made it hard for the multi-hyphenate to focus on his teleplay adaptation of the courtroom drama that put him on the map as a scribe in 1989.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
