She reportedly teamed up with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles to land the ideal candidate.\n\n\u201cOur show has always jumped at any opportunity to help me do something for the Latinx community,\u201d Rodriguez, 33, told the industry mag. \u201cSo I asked my showrunner, Jennie (Snyder Urman), if we could do something different with the money this year.\u201d About 65,000 undocumented students graduate high school every year, according to 2015 Department of Education estimates.\n\nAhead of Emmy nominations, networks and streaming services clamor for voters\u2019 attention with increasingly elaborate For Your Consideration campaigns. (An L.A. Times article last year, for example, spotlighted Netflix\u2019s 24,000-square-foot Beverly Hills campaigning space, complete with installations for \u201cOrange Is the New Black,\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d aimed at giving voters an \u201cexperience.\u201d) \u201cFYC is a bizarre dance,\" Rodriguez said. \u201cWhatever you do requires an insane amount of money.\u201d\n\nAlso read: Houston Texans NFL quarterback Deshaun Watson donates his first paycheck to Hurricane Harvey victims\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how much Rodriguez\u2019s FYC allowance entailed, the estimated cost of attending Princeton for the 2018-19 academic year is $70,010. (Meanwhile, the average private nonprofit four-year school cost $46,950 for the 2017-18 year, according to the College Board, including tuition, fees, room and board.) The actress felt \u201cinvigorated\u201d by her move, THR reported, but also ambivalent about the reveal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taboo to talk about the money being spent, but it\u2019s the reality,\u201d she said. \u201cI think sharing this might inspire other people to do something similar. You can desire recognition and, at the same time, decide to not play in the confines of the game as it\u2019s set up.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s in good company: Nicki Minaj last year paid off thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of fans\u2019 student loans, books and tuition, while Chrissy Teigen ponied up for a fan\u2019s beauty school tuition. Taylor Swift in 2015 sent a fan $1,989 -- a nod to her album \u201c1989\u201d -- to help with student loans.\n\nRodriguez, who stars as the CW hit\u2019s titular Jane, plays a single-mom romance novelist from a multigenerational Latina family. Poised to appear in the fifth and final season of the satirical telenovela homage, she has yet to be nominated for an Emmy -- though she did land the best actress Golden Globe in 2015.\n\nThe actress, who graduated in 2006 from New York University\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts, also knows firsthand the burdens of college costs -- revealing in a 2017 \u201cLate Show\u201d interview that she had only paid off her student loans a year earlier, the same day she received her second Golden Globe nomination.", "images": ["http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GW807_c0d060_ZG_20181030180640.jpg", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI443_Obesit_MC_20190429113340.jpg", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/app-store.svg", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HJ588_facebo_MC_20190515061018.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX775_meera_NS_20181102190302.jpg", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN253_arends_MC_20190712135126.jpg", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB141_dark_w_MC_20190102124710.jpg", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN151_canary_MC_20190711144336.jpg", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/google-play.png", "https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/ZH/MW-GW807_c0d060_20181030180640_ZH.jpg", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/foxtrot/public/images/backgrounds/mobile_devices.png"], "top_img": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GW807_c0d060_ZG_20181030180640.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gina-rodriguez-is-using-her-emmy-money-to-send-an-undocumented-student-to-princeton-2018-06-20-12881416", "title": "Gina Rodriguez is using her Emmy money to send an undocumented student to Princeton", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "page.site": "marketwatch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "The \u2018Jane the Virgin\u2019 star\u2019s For Your Consideration cash will benefit an unnamed young Latina woman", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gina-rodriguez-is-using-her-emmy-money-to-send-an-undocumented-student-to-princeton-2018-06-20-12881416", "title": "Gina Rodriguez is using her Emmy money to send an undocumented student to Princeton", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GW807_c0d060_ZG_20181030180640.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": {"id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The \u2018Jane the Virgin\u2019 star\u2019s For Your Consideration cash will benefit an unnamed young Latina woman", "image": {"identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GW807_c0d060_ZG_20181030180640.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@meerajag"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "33C54534-915D-41AF-9F59-BCFD8DA39048", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "author": "Meera Jagannathan", "description": "The \u2018Jane the Virgin\u2019 star\u2019s For Your Consideration cash will benefit an unnamed young Latina woman", "article.column": "Moneyish", "article.doctype": 88, "article.template": "Normal", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "parsely-title": "Gina Rodriguez is using her Emmy money to send an undocumented student to Princeton", "parsely-link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gina-rodriguez-is-using-her-emmy-money-to-send-an-undocumented-student-to-princeton-2018-06-20-12881416", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-author": "Meera Jagannathan", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-06-20T12:14:00-04:00", "parsely-post-id": "33C54534-915D-41AF-9F59-BCFD8DA39048", "parsely-tags": "PageType: Article, Column: Moneyish, Doctype: 88, Template: Normal, GUID: 33C54534-915D-41AF-9F59-BCFD8DA39048", "theme-color": "#2e2e2f", "position": 1}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529467200.0, "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com", "summary": ""}
