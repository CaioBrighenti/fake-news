Ahead of their appearance Thursday on Good Morning America, the actress from The Last Jedi was spotted giving a pep talk to the roly-poly droid for the live taping.\n\n\u201cHoney, you don\u2019t have to be nervous,\u201d Dern tells BB-8. \u201cBB, you\u2019ve done this so much. We\u2019ve been doing press all week.\u201d\n\nHer advice for dealing with all the cameras? \u201cStay focused and have a great time, BB!\u201d\n\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, the video (shown above) ends with Dern giving the mechanical ball of love a belly rub.\n\nReese Witherspoon, Dern\u2019s Big Little Lies costar, even commented on the exchange. \u201cI love him! Can BB-8 be in [Big Little Lies season 2]?\u201d Witherspoon tweeted. Dern already has an idea of how that would work out.\n\n\u201cUm\u2026yes. Easy. Renata just bought the real BB-8 for Christmas for her daughter. Knowing u would likely get your daughter the toy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nUm\u2026yes. Easy.
