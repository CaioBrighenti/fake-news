We are both amazing parents and our kids will be happy n never know the difference other than seeing mama smile,\u201d continued Wilkinson, 32, who shares two children with Baskett: son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah, 3.\n\n\u201cSometimes love looks funny.

I want to see happy Hank again\u2026 i miss that,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMarriage was just a piece of paper and a piece of jewelry but our hearts will always be real. U will prob see us together a lot but it\u2019s because there\u2019s no hate.\u201d\n\nWilkinson concluded: \u201cLove wins in this case it\u2019s just looks a little funny.
