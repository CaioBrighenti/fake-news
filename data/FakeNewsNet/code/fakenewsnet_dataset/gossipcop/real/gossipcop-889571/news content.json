{"url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/taylor-swift-transforms-into-a-nude-cyborg-in-ready-for-it-we-are-so-not-ready", "text": "In August, Taylor Swift released a series of blurry, pseudo-artsy snakes on her social media. As fans struggled to find meaning in this serpentine imagery Swift upped the ante, sharing a promo image for her new album, Reputation\u2014a sultry, black and white portrait that managed to beautifully capture all the angst and font-play of a middle school computer class project. While Swift gets a solid B/B+ in graphic design, her ability to dominate the national conversation\u2014and in the midst of a solar eclipse, no less!\u2014is unparalleled. With some grainy reptile footage and a \u201cFake News\u201d narrative, Swift ushered in the next stage of her controversial career.\n\nWhile Reputation isn\u2019t dropping until November, it feels like everything there is to say about TayTay has already been said. The new Taylor Swift era has been described as Trumpian, petty, self-aware, self-obsessed, aggressively bad, and not as good as Carly Rae Jepsen. Turns out, Taylor Swift doesn\u2019t need to actually put out good pop music to stay on top; her new strategy appears to be generating buzz through diss tracks and coded lyrics while padding her dream wedding fund with overpriced merch and corporate partnerships. Who needs to write a danceable chorus when you can just put your face on a bunch of UPS trucks? Delivering packages is the new delivering hits.\n\nTake \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the first single off of Reputation, which effectively set the tone for Swift\u2019s new era. Musically, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d is\u2026not good. But no one cares, since the track is chock full of not-so-subtle jabs at Swift\u2019s uber-famous enemies.\n\nAfter listening to the song ten times and then once backwards combing for receipts, fans were invited to go further down the conspiracy rabbit hole with the Easter egg-heavy \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d music video. Like Arya Stark without rhythm, Swift brags that \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined.\u201d She bathes in a tub of diamonds (A dig at the Kim Kardashian jewel theft?), shades Kanye\u2019s \u201ctilted stage,\u201d and even gets a few insults in at the past iterations of Taylor Swift. While Swift\u2019s meta-commentary was clearly meant to show that she\u2019s in on the joke, it ends up underlining the pop star\u2019s lack of self-awareness. Laughing about your reputation for playing the victim isn\u2019t believable when you\u2019re still complaining about all the people who are mean to you. Releasing this diss track as her first single proved that Taylor Swift still sees herself as the injured party, despite the fact that she is quite literally on the attack.\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s failure to understand why people don\u2019t like Taylor Swift is also apparent in her latest music video, \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d The majority of the Joseph Kahn-directed joint is spent watching a cyborg Taylor Swift stare longingly at a second cyborg Taylor Swift, which sounds about right. The main message of the music video is that Taylor Swift knows that we think she\u2019s a robot; the second, subtler takeaway is that Taylor Swift definitely saw Ghost in the Shell. Unlike the genuinely clever \u201cBlank Space,\u201d Swift\u2019s seemingly satirical lyrics fall flat here, as she ineffectively straddles the line between a scary-sincere love song and a parody of a Taylor Swift single.\n\nWhen Swift sings, \u201cYounger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so / I see nothing better, I keep him forever / Like a vendetta-ta,\u201d it seems obvious that she\u2019s mocking her reputation as a cold, ruthless serial monogamist with a Rhode Island basement full of future boyfriends. Then again, lyrics like, \u201cKnew I was a robber first time that he saw me / Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin\u2019 sorry / But if I\u2019m a thief, then he can join the heist, and / We\u2019ll move to an island, and / And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor\u201d might actually be sincere. For all of her purported self-awareness, Swift is still writing corny lyrics about an interchangeable white boy who she\u2019ll probably break up with come Christmas. In other words, this is the same old Taylor Swift\u2014just with a higher visual effects budget.\n\nAgain, the video seems to be taking a good deal of visual cues from Ghost in the Shell, specifically Major Motoko\u2019s \u201cfull-body prosthesis\u201d\u2014which is fine since white people have already ruined that. A hooded, Hot Topic Taylor cyborg-struts through a gritty sci-fi garage, where she encounters her near-naked cyborg doppelg\u00e4nger. The two Taylors face off across an invisible barrier. At one point, a cyborg Taylor appears to be channeling her past selves, sitting on top of the white horse from Fearless and/or her \u201cBlank Space\u201d music video\u2014Taylor Swift\u2019s old horse can\u2019t come to the phone right now, \u2018cause it\u2019s a reanimated robot corpse.\n\nThe idea that the innocent, heartsick songstress from the Fearless era is now a ruthless cyborg girl on a creepy robot horse is very 2017. \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d is really just a music video for anyone who feels like a cold, hollowed-out shell of their former self, just going through the motions.\n\nIn the end, Taylor Swift (the naked robot) is the only one who\u2019s strong enough to defeat Taylor Swift (the robot with dramatic eyeliner). The moral of the story seems to be that no mere mortal can stop Taylor Swift and Joseph Kahn from slowly assembling a Lemonade-lite visual album (Minute Maid? Milk?). Time will only tell which Beyonc\u00e9 music video/Scarlett Johansson flop Swift will rip off next.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_545,w_969,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1509128091/Screen_Shot_2017-10-27_at_2.05.06_PM_smr8ga", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779073/author/amy-halperin-zimmerman-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_545,w_969,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1509128091/Screen_Shot_2017-10-27_at_2.05.06_PM_smr8ga"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_545,w_969,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1509128091/Screen_Shot_2017-10-27_at_2.05.06_PM_smr8ga", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/taylor-swift-transforms-into-a-nude-cyborg-in-ready-for-it-we-are-so-not-ready", "title": "Taylor Swift Transforms Into a Nude Cyborg in \u2018...Ready for It?\u2019 We Are So Not Ready.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Taylor Swift Transforms Into a Nude Cyborg in \u2018...Ready for It?\u2019 We Are So Not Ready.", "keywords": "Taylor Swift, Nudity, Beyonc\u00e9, Beyonc\u00e9, Music video, Scarlett Johansson, Science fiction", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Transforms Into a Nude Cyborg in \u2018...Ready for It?\u2019 We Are So Not Ready.", "description": "The pop dynamo\u2019s latest music video is a head-scratching take on Scarlett Johansson\u2019s dreadful \u2018Ghost in the Shell\u2019 remake.", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/taylor-swift-transforms-into-a-nude-cyborg-in-ready-for-it-we-are-so-not-ready", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_545,w_969,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1509128091/Screen_Shot_2017-10-27_at_2.05.06_PM_smr8ga"}, "description": "The pop dynamo\u2019s latest music video is a head-scratching take on Scarlett Johansson\u2019s dreadful \u2018Ghost in the Shell\u2019 remake.", "authors": "Amy Zimmerman", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/undefined", "fb": {"app_id": 189930913679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thedailybeast", "creator": "@ahzimm", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_545,w_969,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_600/f_jpg/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1509128091/Screen_Shot_2017-10-27_at_2.05.06_PM_smr8ga"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-27T18:11:43.000Z", "author": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/authors/amy-zimmerman"}, "sailthru.date": "2017-10-27T18:11:43.000Z", "sailthru.expire_date": "2017-11-10T18:11:43.000Z", "publicationDate": 201710271811, "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Amy Zimmerman\",\"link\":\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/taylor-swift-transforms-into-a-nude-cyborg-in-ready-for-it-we-are-so-not-ready\",\"metadata\":{\"articleType\":\"article\"},\"post_id\":\"taylor-swift-transforms-into-a-nude-cyborg-in-ready-for-it-we-are-so-not-ready\",\"pub_date\":\"2017-10-27T18:11:43+00:00\",\"section\":null,\"tags\":[\"Taylor Swift\",\"Nudity\",\"Beyonc\u00e9\",\"Beyonc\u00e9\",\"Music video\",\"Scarlett Johansson\",\"Science fiction\",\"typeArticle\"],\"title\":\"Taylor Swift Transforms Into a Nude Cyborg in \u2018...Ready for It?\u2019 We Are So Not Ready.\",\"type\":\"post\"}"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tmd-ClpJxA?&enablejsapi=1&playsinline=0&autoplay=0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wIft-t-MQuE?&enablejsapi=1&playsinline=0&autoplay=0"], "publish_date": 1509127903.0, "source": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
