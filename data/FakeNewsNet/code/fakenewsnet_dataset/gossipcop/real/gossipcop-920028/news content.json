The light was quickly turned off and you could see his crew helping him off - and the band ran over as well.\n\n\"It was about another 20 minutes before Faith Hill came out to say the show was ending early.\"\n\nThe gig, at Dublin's 3 Arena was the final date of a three-day, three-city tour of the UK and Ireland, as part of the Country to Country festival.\n\nMcGraw and Hill were co-headliners, and had played in London on Friday night, then in Glasgow on Saturday.\n\nHill said the whole crew had been left \"a little bit dehydrated\" from \"travelling so much\".\n\nA spokesman for McGraw said the star \"was attended to by local medical staff on-site and will be fine\".\n\n\"He and Faith thank everyone for their love and support and look forward to seeing their Irish fans again soon.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Tim McGraw and Faith Hill married in 1996\n\nRecently, McGraw made headlines as being one of the few mainstream country artists to voice support for gun control.\n\nOn 3 March, he praised the US sporting goods store Dick's, after it raised the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years.\n\n\"Thank you @Dicks for taking a stand to promote a meaningful discussion for the safety of our kids!\" McGraw wrote on Twitter, tagging other major retailers including Walmart, Kroger and LL Bean.\n\nThose outlets later followed Dick's lead.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
