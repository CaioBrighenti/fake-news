Ever. Maybe in all 50 years,\u201d he told The New York Times about the incident. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no reason for me to be other than there\u2019s no explaining it. Do you know what I mean? The only person who can explain that would be Diane [Lane], and she\u2019s chosen not to, so I\u2019m O.K. with that.\u201d\n\nBrolin was arrested in 2004 in the West Los Angeles home he shared at the time with Diane Lane, who phoned police claiming that he had hit her. The actor was charged with spousal battery and released after posting $20,000 bail, said Kelly Bush, a spokeswoman for the couple.\n\n\u201cThere was a misunderstanding at their home,\u201d Bush told the Daily News at the time, saying that the arrest was \u201cfor the lowest-end misdemeanor charge of domestic battery. \u2026 Diane did not want to press charges and asked them not to arrest him, but in cases involving the possibility of any physical contact, the police have to arrest first, ask questions later.\n\nImage zoom Diane Lane and Josh Brolin. Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic\n\nBush added that the two are back together in their home \u201cand are embarrassed the matter went this far.\u201d\n\nThe couple remained married for nine more years before filing for divorce in 2013.\n\nWhile The New York Times noted that Brolin \u201cunderstands he needs to talk about it,\u201d the actor focused mostly on what he has learned about himself since the arrest. (Lane declined to comment for profile).\n\n\u201cI was more reactive, I was more, \u2018People need to know the truth,\u2019 \u201d Brolin said of his initial reaction to the incident. \u201cWhatever I say [now] is going to sound like compensation for a perpetrator. I\u2019ve gotten to a place where all that matters is that I have control over my behavior, and at that time, it was a little more chaotic.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Josh Brolin and Kathryn Boyd. J. Kempin/Getty\n\nIn September 2016, Brolin married his former assistant and model Kathryn Boyd, and in late May they announced they were expecting a baby girl with a sweet Instagram post.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new sheriff in town and she\u2019s no bigger than a sweet potato. Hang on to your hats,\u201d he captioned a photo series of the mom-to-be showing off her bare baby belly while out on a hike.\n\nBrolin has also had a career year at the box office, starring as Thanos in Avengers Infinity War and as Cable in Deadpool 2. His next film, Sicario: Day of the Soldado, hits theaters June 29.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ed-sheeran.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/josh-brolin-diane-lane.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2064px%2C1083px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/josh-brolin-diane-lane.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/josh-gracin-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2160px%2C1134px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/asap-rocky1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nilsa-prowant.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/jordyn-woods-jada.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/hayden-panettiere.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/josh-brolin3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lauren-bushnell-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C243px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/michael-b-jordan-11.jpg?crop=0px%2C127px%2C2471px%2C1297px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c1648abf15ab582b95dc580d09b34c5?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/unknown-9.jpg?crop=0px%2C232px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/hough-laich-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1267px%2C666px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lil-nas-x.jpg?crop=0px%2C237px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gettyimages-1027812288.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-802901548.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/ariana-grande-2-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1288px%2C677px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/kunis-kutcher-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sambird2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bill-montag-heidi.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-14-at-3.44.31-pm.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/luann3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/amber-portwood-boyfriend-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C722px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/josh-brolin-diane-lane.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2064px%2C1083px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/josh-brolin-addresses-2004-diane-lane-domestic-abuse-arrest-no-explaining/", "title": "Josh Brolin Addresses 2004 Diane Lane Domestic Abuse Arrest: 'There's No Explaining It'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Diane Lane,Josh Brolin,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News", "news_keywords": "Diane Lane,Josh Brolin,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News", "description": "\u201cGod, I\u2019ve never been so careful with my words.
