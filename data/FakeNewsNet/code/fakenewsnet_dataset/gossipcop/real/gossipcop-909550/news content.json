In 2017 she starred as the controversial figure skater Tonya Harding in the biopic I, Tonya.\n\nMargot Robbie attends the 21st Annual Hollywood Film Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on November 5, 2017 in Beverly Hills, California.

Visit Website\n\nHollywood Breakthrough: 'Wolf of Wall Street'\n\nFew remember her debut film, the Australian-made I.C.U., a serial killer thriller shot when she was 17 and released in 2009. Richard Curtis\u2019 time-travel rom-com About Time (2013), with Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams, made more of a splash. But it was her role as Naomi, Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Brooklyn bombshell wife and \u201cthe Duchess of Bay Ridge,\u201d in Martin Scorsese\u2019s fact-based epic of financial flim-flammery The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) that turned heads.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

The comedic scene involved her explaining mortgage-backed securities and subprime loans all the while floating in a tub of bubbles with champagne in hand.\n\nMore Margot Robbie Movies: From 'Focus' to 'Suicide Squad'\n\nRobbie co-starred with Will Smith in Focus (2015), as con artists who steal each other\u2019s hearts. That same year she also starred in the sci-fi drama Z for Zachariah before re-teaming with Smith in the comics-based smash Suicide Squad (2016), with Robbie punkily attired as fan fave Harley Quinn, the psycho psychiatrist who is a muse to Jared Leto\u2019s Joker. She told The Washington Post that diving into a vat of \u201cgluggy paint stuff\u201d to bleach Harley\u2019s skin in one scene was \u201cthe most unpleasant thing I\u2019ve ever done in my entire life,\u201d and her spiky accouterment wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable either.\n\nIn 2016 Robbie also starred as Jane in The Legend of Tarzan and the following year, the wife of Winnie the Pooh author A.A. Milne in the historical drama Goodbye Christopher Robin.\n\nRobbie planned to reprise her popular characterization of Harley Quinn in Gotham City Sirens, though that project was reportedly shelved in favor of another spinoff, Birds of Prey, co-starring Ewan McGregor and scheduled for an early 2020 release.\n\nRobbie will portray actress Sharon Tate in 2019's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nPlaying Tonya Harding in 'I, Tonya'\n\nA three-year-old toddler when the 1994 Winter Olympics were held, Robbie had no idea who Harding was, or what the infamous \u201cwhacking incident\u201d involving Nancy Kerrigan was all about. As co-producer of the black comedy I, Tonya (2017), Robbie dove headlong into the part, recreating her every gesture as closely as possible. She did meet Harding, though limited their time together to a couple of hours \u2014 \u201cotherwise I might have too much empathy for her,\u201d she said after its premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nWhile Harding\u2019s famous triple axel was recreated digitally, Robbie performed some of the skating routines on her own accord and impressed enough with her overall performance to earn Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for Best Actress.\n\nGrowing Up in Australia's Gold Coast\n\nRobbie was born in Dalby, Queensland, Australia on July 2, 1990, and grew up in Gold Coast, a city 500 miles north of Sydney. Her mother, a physiotherapist, raised her and her three siblings after her parents divorced. Her father is a farmer. She told Vanity Fair that she thought she might be a magician, but an interest in drama in high school led her to Melbourne and a kids\u2019 show, The Elephant Princess, co-starring the up-and-coming Liam Hemsworth.\n\nEarly Career: Australian Soap Opera 'Neighbours'\n\nRobbie has been professionally acting since her teens. Before she left for Hollywood, Australian audiences knew her from the TV soap opera Neighbours, which began airing five years before her birth. Fearing she failed her audition, she decided to vacation in Canada but had to return quickly when she found out she had won the part of the vivacious Donna Freedman in 2008. Donna\u2019s kiss with a female friend stirred controversy, though she remained a viewer favorite and was nominated for several awards. She left Neighbours in 2010 (in a \u201cboring old happy ending\u201d) but her first American TV show, Pan Am (2011), crash-landed after one season.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nRobbie met assistant director Tom Ackerley on the World War II-set drama Suite Francaise (2014). The two began dating and eventually got married in December 2016.", "images": ["https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE4MDAzNDEwNDU2NjQzMDg2/cate-blanchett-9214915-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NTU2MzE2MDQ4NjIzMTE1/heath-ledger-266035-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_458/MTQ1NTMzOTkyNDA0MjY0NTAz/sitelogowhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTUxNTg0MTEwMTY1MzcwMDQw/margot-robbie_gettyimages-870916736.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU0ODUwMjQ0NjIwNzI0MDAx/chris-hemsworth-poses-during-a-photo-call-for-thor-ragnarok-on-october-15-2017-in-sydney-australia-photo-by-mark-metcalfe_getty-images-for-disney-square.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU3NTg4MzA0MjU3MDk5NjU5/ruby-rose-attends-the-rei-kawakubo_comme-des-garcons-art-of-the-in-between-costume-institute-gala-at-metropolitan-museum-of-art-on-may-1-2017-in-new-york-city-photo-by-dimitrios-kambouris_getty-images.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTIwNjA4NjM0MDQxOTU5OTQ4/toni-collette-9542293-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTUxNTgzODk3Mjk2MDUzNTE2/gettyimages-870916736.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTQ3NjM5ODU2MjA4NTUzMzQ4/iggy_azalea_photo_by_axeell_bauer-griffin_filmmagic_getty_469331242.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTUzMDQzNDUxMjAwNDE1MzUy/katherine-langford-wearing-dior-attends-lynn-hirschberg-celebrates-w-magazines-it-girls-with-dior-at-aoc-on-january-6-2018-in-los-angeles-california-photo-by-stefanie-keenan_getty-images-for-w-magazin.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTUxNTg0MTEwMTY1MzcwMDQw/margot-robbie_gettyimages-870916736.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTIwNjA4NjM0MjIyODM5MzA4/the-cinema-society--calvin-klein-collection-host-a-screening-of-the-hunger-games---inside-arrivals.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTQ1NTM0MTQ5NzA3NDQxNzE5/navbarwhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE1ODA0OTcxOTA3NTgxNDUz/hugh-jackman-16599916-1-402.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTUxNTg0MTEwMTY1MzcwMDQw/margot-robbie_gettyimages-870916736.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.biography.com/actor/margot-robbie", "title": "Margot Robbie", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "Rw9Z4UJK89QUjgFzrFI2QbZmTRyWu_Cuy15hu4Y1MXw", "msvalidate.01": "565AA37CB662E60BF24DDCABEC686D8F", "generator": "Tempest -
