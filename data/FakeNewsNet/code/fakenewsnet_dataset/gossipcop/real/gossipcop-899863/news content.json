Diva?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, the shoes alone, man,\u201d Hanks joked, quickly adding, \u201cNo, I am so joking.\u201d\n\nTurns out, the Oscar-winning actress doesn\u2019t get any special treatment.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s scary about Meryl? She comes in and does it just like everybody else does,\u201d Hanks explained. \u201cYou\u2019re expecting French horns before she enters the stage.\u201d\n\nPutting on a voice, he continued, \u201cYou expect a guy in livery to come out: \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, the actress known as Meryl Streep.\u2019 And she comes in and waves to the crew the way the royals used to.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep Lars Niki/Getty\n\nHowever, Streep was thrown for a loop by Steven Spielberg\u2019s directing style.\n\n\u201cShe was mad at me because I didn\u2019t tell her Steven doesn\u2019t rehearse. He just wants to figure it out as he goes along. He\u2019s almost like a guerrilla filmmaker,\u201d Hanks shared. \u201cHe has the set, he has the space and he wants to fill it with something he hasn\u2019t imagined before. I don\u2019t mean to [say] that he\u2019s not prepared \u2014 he\u2019s the most prepared man in the world.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep in The Post Niko Tavernise/Twentieth Century Fox\n\nSpielberg takes a look back to the summer of 1971 when President Richard Nixon shattered norms by taking action to silence the media.\n\nThousands of pages of secret documents about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, documenting from the end of World War II until 1967, were leaked to The New York Times, which began publishing them in a series that became known as the Pentagon Papers. Nixon responded to the leak by securing a court order that barred the newspaper from publishing after only a handful of stories were printed.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: 2018 Golden Globe Nominations: Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, and Big Little Lies All Score\n\nThat\u2019s where Spielberg\u2019s film picks up as The Washington Post, headed by publisher Katherine Graham (Streep) and editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), must grapple with whether to begin publishing the reports themselves \u2014 at the risk of garnering the same swift shut down, or worse, if the Nixon administration decided to make an example of them.\n\nThe Post hits theaters Dec. 22.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tom-holland-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630",
