All the billboards feature the couple's newborn daughter, Alexis.\n\n\"These just went up on alongside I-10 into Palm Springs. @olympiaohanian & I wanted to welcome her back to tennis. Designed them myself, with some help from Jr.,\" he captioned the photo stream, along with the hashtag \"#GMOAT,\" which stands for Greatest Mother of All Time.\n\nInstagram\n\nWilliams, 36, responded to the photos in the comments section, writing: \"Literally am crying. This is so sweet. I love you.\"\n\nOhanian responded, \"See you soon, GMOAT.\"\n\nIn the August issue of Vanity Fair, the power couple shared their love story, which began at a hotel in Rome, Italy. Ohanian was seated at a table nearby Williams for breakfast, which displeased the athlete, so she joked with him that there was a rat in the restaurant in an effort to get him to move.\n\n\"I\u2019m from Brooklyn. I see rats all the time,\" he responded. That's when Williams asked him to join her party, and the rest is history.\n\nCheck out more of Williams and Ohanian's love story:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSerena Williams Covers Vogue With Baby Daughter, Opens Up About Post-Birth Health Complications\n\nSerena Williams Opens Up About Postpartum Complications After Giving Birth to Daughter Alexis\n\nSerena Williams' Daughter Adorably Cheers Her On at First Competitive Match Since Giving Birth: Pics!\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x169/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1242911076001_5697149249001_5697121637001-vs.jpg?itok=rv8VqAtX", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1028097610.jpg?itok=zdOFCVFb&h=ffddd1a0", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?itok=v47et-Gl", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?itok=CvZ6Mvb2&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-02/screenshot_20180227-120115.png?itok=DQ-siOB7"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?itok=v47et-Gl", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Willis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-cries-over-husband-alexis-ohanian-surprising-her-with-billboards-of-their-baby", "title": "Serena Williams Cries Over Husband Alexis Ohanian Surprising Her With Billboards of Their Baby", "meta_data": {"title": "Serena Williams Cries Over Husband Alexis Ohanian Surprising Her With Billboards of Their Baby  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-cries-over-husband-alexis-ohanian-surprising-her-with-billboards-of-their-baby", "title": "Serena Williams Cries Over Husband Alexis Ohanian Surprising Her With Billboards of Their Baby", "description": "The Reddit co-founder welcomed his wife back to tennis in a big way.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?itok=v47et-Gl", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Reddit co-founder welcomed his wife back to tennis in a big way.", "title": "Serena Williams Cries Over Husband Alexis Ohanian Surprising Her With Billboards of Their Baby", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jackie Willis\u200d \u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-cries-over-husband-alexis-ohanian-surprising-her-with-billboards-of-their-baby", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?itok=v47et-Gl"}, "description": "The Reddit co-founder welcomed his wife back to tennis in a big way.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Serena Williams, Alexis Ohanian", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Serena Williams, Alexis Ohanian"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
