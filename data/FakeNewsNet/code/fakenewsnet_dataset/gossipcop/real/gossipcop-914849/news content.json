However, the backlash from her recent disastrous national anthem performance at the NBA All-Star Game was so bad that her former hubby was caught bringing her some roses.\n\nThe film and TV star was spotted outside his ex-wife\u2019s place Monday along with their 4-year-old son, Axl. The star opted for a dressed-down look in just a T-shirt and sweatpants, but it was his gift-bearing arms that held the biggest surprise.\n\nThe star arrived with a bouquet of roses, presumably for Fergie. It seems he\u2019s hoping a combination of time with her son and flowers will help get her out of the post-anthem funk. As previously reported, Fergie appeared Sunday night at the All-Star Game, where she attempted to give a jazzy rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d While it was a bold choice, fans weren\u2019t having it.\n\nThe star spent most of Monday being lambasted by people on Twitter as well as stars like Roseanne. That would be enough to leave anyone in need of a little pick-me-up, but it didn\u2019t stop there. Things got so bad that Fergie actually released an apology for her performance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been honored and proud to perform the national anthem and last night I wanted to try something special for the NBA. I\u2019m a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn\u2019t strike the intended tone. I love this country and honestly tried my best,\u201d the former Black Eyed Peas singer told TMZ.\n\nAs previously reported, Duhamel and Fergie announced they were divorcing in September 2017.\n\n\u201cWith absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,\u201d the couple said in a joint statement at the time. \u201cTo give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public.\u201d\n\nAxl is the duo\u2019s only child together.", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/fergie-josh-duhamel.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/fergie-josh-duhamel.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fox-news-logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=142", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/d29ea10c24a74df597d0ccaa32076ecd/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/fergie-josh-duhamel.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Fox News", "February"], "canonical_link": "http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/02/19/fergies-ex-husband-josh-duhamel-brings-flowers-following-national-anthem-debacle.html", "title": "Josh Duhamel brings flowers to Fergie after national anthem flub", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2019 NYP Holdings.
