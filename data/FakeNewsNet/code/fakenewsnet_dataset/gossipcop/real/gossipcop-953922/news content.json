In E!'s detailed report of Kylie's festivities, a source revealed to the outlet that Kendall took her current boyfriend Ben Simmons to Kylie's dinner at Craig's Restaurant. Ben plays for the Philadelphia 76ers and has been spending his off-season basically living with Kendall in LA. But also at the restaurant, eating dinner at a table nearby, was Kendall's ex from last fall, Blake Griffin, who plays for the Detroit Pistons.\n\nTheir breakup in the spring led a source to later say that he was the reason Kendall was reluctant to be Ben or anyone's girlfriend this summer. \"She feels that whenever she has been serious about guys in the past, it\u2019s kind of a mess and doesn\u2019t work out,\" that source told People back in June. \"She invested time in the relationship with Blake Griffin. She isn\u2019t planning on doing the same right now.\"\n\nPer E!'s source regarding last night, Kendall and Ben just breezed past Blake without saying a word to him. \u201cThey didn\u2019t interact at all,\u201d a source reveals. \u201cIt was awkward.\u201d Yep.\n\nInstagram\n\nAt Kylie's party after dinner, Ben and Kendall arrived separately but acted coupley at Delilah, the second venue. They \u201cwere canoodling at the bar\u201d and \u201cnot hiding\u201d their affection for one another, E!'s source said. There was no acknowledgement on any of the Kardashians' Instagram posts of Kendall's drama, but there's always next season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians (where footage of this party will presumably air) to look forward to.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-blake-1519918788.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-blake-1519918788.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey", "News", "Strategy Editor", "Alyssa Bailey Is The News", "Strategy Editor At Elle.Com", "Where She Oversees Coverage Of Celebrities", "Royals", "Particularly Meghan Markle", "Kate Middleton ."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a22698935/kendall-jenner-awkward-moment-ben-simmons-ex-blake-griffin-kylie-21st-birthday-dinner/", "title": "Kendall Jenner's Awkward Moment With Ben Simmons and Ex Blake Griffin at Kylie\u2019s 21st Birthday Dinner", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Kendall Jenner Had an 'Awkward' Moment With Her Ex Blake Griffin at Kylie\u2019s Birthday Dinner", "description": "Her new boyfriend Ben Simmons was with her.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a22698935/kendall-jenner-awkward-moment-ben-simmons-ex-blake-griffin-kylie-21st-birthday-dinner/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-blake-1519918788.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-08-10 04:48:29", "published_time": "2018-08-10 04:47:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-blake-1519918788.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Kendall Jenner's Awkward Moment With Ben Simmons and Ex Blake Griffin at Kylie\u2019s 21st Birthday Dinner", "description": "\u200bKylie Jenner's 21st birthday dinner and party had a lot of things\u200b: adult ball pits, Barbie and booze-adorned cakes, and a good serving of some quiet side-drama starring Kendall Jenner and two basketball players she's been involved with.", "keywords": "ben simmons, blake griffin, kendall jenner, kendall jenner ben simmons, kendall jenner blake griffin, kendall jenner boyfriend, kendall jenner ex, kylie jenner birthday party", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-blake-1519918788.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture,celebrities,kendall jenner blake griffin,kendall jenner ex,kylie jenner birthday party,kendall jenner ben simmons,kendall jenner boyfriend,ben simmons,blake griffin,Kendall Jenner", "sailthru.date": "2018-08-10T16:47:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-blake-1519918788.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-blake-1519918788.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kendall Jenner Had an 'Awkward' Moment With Her Ex Blake Griffin at Kylie\u2019s Birthday Dinner", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533890820.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
