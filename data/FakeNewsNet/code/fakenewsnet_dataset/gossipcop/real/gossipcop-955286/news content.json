{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Elverum", "text": "Phil Elverum (born Phil Elvrum; May 23, 1978)[1][2] is an American songwriter, producer and visual artist, best known for his musical projects The Microphones and Mount Eerie. Based in Anacortes, Washington, in the mid-2000s he began to spell his surname Elvrum as \"Elverum\", after the Norwegian town of the same name.[3]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nElverum is best known for having recorded and performed prolifically under the band names The Microphones (1996\u20132003) and Mount Eerie (2003\u2013present). The Believer Magazine described his work as \"delicately sparse or layered and noisy, often in the same song. Lyrically, he focuses on memory, first-person storytelling, myth, naturalism, the everyday as sacred, and sense of place (in and out of Washington State)\".[4] Elverum uses mostly analog recording equipment and often works in his own studio spaces, where he has the time and freedom to experiment with sounds.[5] He records at a disused church in Anacortes, Washington called \"The Unknown\".[6]\n\nIn 2004, Elverum established the label P. W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd.,[7] through which he has released records by Mount Eerie and The Microphones, as well as The Spectacle, Thanksgiving, Woelv, Nicholas Krgovich, Key Losers and Wyrd Visions. Prior to this, he was closely linked to K Records and the Olympia, Washington music scene, where he produced recordings by Mirah, Little Wings, Beat Happening, The Blow, and others.\n\nElverum is also an occasional member of the Anacortes band D+ with Karl Blau and Bret Lunsford. His musical influences include Eric's Trip, Will Oldham, Bj\u00f6rk, Nirvana, Popol Vuh, Sunn O))), and Angelo Badalamenti.[8][9]\n\nOther work [ edit ]\n\nElverum is also known for his artwork and photography. Early in his career he produced limited-run fanzines and song booklets which would be sold during Microphones tours. Since establishing P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd., he began to experiment with letterpress printing and other elaborate packaging ideas for his releases.[10] In 2007, he published a hardcover book of film photography with a picture disc EP titled Mount Eerie pts. 6 & 7. This was followed in 2014 by Dust, a book of digital photography bound in stamped linen.\n\nIn 2005, Elverum created a 365-day comic calendar titled Fancy People Adventures, which was later syndicated by music website Tiny Mix Tapes.[11] In late 2008 Buenaventura Press published Dawn, a book and CD of journal entries and songs from winter 2002/03, during which Elverum lived in a remote cabin in Finnkonevika, Kjerring\u00f8y, Norway.\n\nElverum has also experimented with filmmaking, producing background visuals for his shows (released as a limited edition DVD entitled Fog Movies) and directing a promotional video for the 2012 Mount Eerie song 'The Place Lives'.[12]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nElverum married Canadian artist and musician Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e in 2003. She recorded under the names Woelv and \u00d4 Paon. Besides occasionally singing on each other's records and playing in one another's backing bands live, the couple did not collaborate artistically. In 2015, Castr\u00e9e was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer following the birth of the couple's first child.[13] Castr\u00e9e died on July 9, 2016.[14][15] The couple had one child, a daughter.[16]\n\nElverum married actress Michelle Williams in July 2018 in a private ceremony in the Adirondacks.[17] On April 19, 2019, People reported they have been separated since January.[18]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/20px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Phil_Elverum_green_shirt.jpg/220px-Phil_Elverum_green_shirt.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg/27px-Wikidata-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Phil_Elverum_green_shirt.jpg/1200px-Phil_Elverum_green_shirt.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Phil_Elverum_green_shirt.jpg/1200px-Phil_Elverum_green_shirt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Elverum", "title": "Phil Elverum", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.34.0-wmf.13", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Phil_Elverum_green_shirt.jpg/1200px-Phil_Elverum_green_shirt.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
