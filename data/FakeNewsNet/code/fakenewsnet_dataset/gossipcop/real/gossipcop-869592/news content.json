Brace for impact!\" Perry's tweet reads, accompanied by a short promo video that finds the singer floating through space.\n\nPerry is up for five of the award show's signature Moonmen herself, including best pop video for \"Chained to the Rhythm.\" In addition to her new role as host of the event, which hits the Forum in Inglewood, Calif. on Aug. 27, the \"Swish Swish\" singer is also set to perform live onstage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been training with MTV in zero gravity, eating astronaut ice cream, and I\u2019m on a group text with Buzz Aldrin and Neil deGrasse Tyson,\u201d Perry adds in a press release. \u201cCome August 27th, I\u2019ll be ready to be your MOONWOMAN! Brace for impact, kids.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes ahead of Perry's world tour for her recent album Witness, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 charts. And she's quite the music video queen -- her recent visual for \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\" surpassed 100 million views in just 18 days, while the video for Teenage Dream's \u201cFirework,\" which won Video of the Year in 2011, just passed one billion. This time around, Kendrick Lamar -- who with eight nominations is the top VMA contender -- goes head-to-head for the award show's prestigious top honor with Bruno Mars, the Weeknd, Alessia Cara and DJ Khaled.\n\nThe MTV Video Music Awards will air live from California on Sunday, August 27 at 8 p.m. EST.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/media/katy-perry-vma-host-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/BB-Recircle-vmas.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/katy-perry-vma-host-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tatiana Cirisano"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/vma/7881831/katy-perry-host-2017-mtv-video-music-awards", "title": "Katy Perry Will Host MTV's 2017 Video Music Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Katy Perry Will Host the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards", "description": "Get ready to \"Witness\" a whole lot more Katy Perry -- the 32-year-old pop star is now slated to host MTV's Video Music Awards, the channel announced today (July 27).", "og": {"title": "Katy Perry Will Host MTV's 2017 Video Music Awards", "description": "Get ready to \"Witness\" a whole lot more Katy Perry -- the 32-year-old pop star is now slated to host MTV's Video Music Awards, the channel announced today (July 27).", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/katy-perry-vma-host-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/vma/7881831/katy-perry-host-2017-mtv-video-music-awards", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/vma/7881831/katy-perry-host-2017-mtv-video-music-awards", "title": "Katy Perry Will Host MTV's 2017 Video Music Awards", "description": "Get ready to \"Witness\" a whole lot more Katy Perry -- the 32-year-old pop star is now slated to host MTV's Video Music Awards, the channel announced today (July 27).", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/katy-perry-vma-host-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
