I haven't heard of anything solid going forward.\"[8] However, in January 2017, Grazer again confirmed a fifth season plan, stating that all of the original series actors are on board for a new season, with an official deal expected to be made \"within a couple of weeks\".[9]\n\nNetflix confirmed on May 17, 2017, that a fifth season, featuring the full cast from the show, had been ordered and would be expected to be released on their service in 2018.[10] Production began in August 2017, with 17 episodes planned for the fifth season.[11] Filming wrapped in November 2017.[12] Tambor had been subject of sexual misconduct allegations in November 2017 which led to him being taken off Transparent; however, the allegations did not impact his inclusion in season 5, and the show's team has stood in support of Tambor since then.[13] On May 7, 2018, it was announced that the fifth season would premiere on May 29, 2018, and the season's trailer was released.
