Over the years, Shelton and his girlfriend Gwen Stefani and Clarkson and her husband, Brandon Blackstock (Shelton\u2019s long-time manager) have enjoyed many double date nights, and the evenings often involved alcohol.\n\nIn a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, Shelton and Clarkson shared some fun stories about the time they have spent together, and the American Idol winner revealed that she wonders why Stefani is with the country music superstar.\n\nClarkson says that the first time she was in Stefani\u2019s house, she felt like Julia Roberts in the scene from Pretty Woman where she walks into the store, and the women were like \u201cyou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s such a style icon as well as this amazing artist,\u201d Clarkson continues. \u201cI literally talked to my husband about her house for hours. I was like, \u2018I felt like I was a good interior decorator, and then I walked into Gwen\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nThen Clarkson made a joke at Shelton\u2019s expense, \u201cAnd then I\u2019m like, why is she with him?!\u201d\n\n@blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT\n\nShelton responded by saying that he has been wondering the same thing. The 41-year-old went on to admit that he was surprised that he ever received an invite to Clarkson\u2019s house and she has the biggest house he has ever seen in his life.\n\nHe then told the story about the last time he was at Clarkson\u2019s, and she started out the night in a white t-shirt, but after a few glasses of wine, it was tie-dyed shirt by the end of the night.\n\nShelton also joked that Clarkson\u2019s house proves that American Idol winners get more winnings than winners of The Voice.\n\nThe Since U Been Gone singer won the first season of Idol back in 2002 and has gone on to become one of the most successful singers in the franchise\u2019s history. But, Clarkson does admit that she does have one bone to pick with the show that made her famous \u2013 she never got her new car.\n\nShe says that Clay Aiken got a car even though he didn\u2019t win, and the show offered Carrie Underwood a plane. When Clarkson found out what Idol had given other contestants, she thought it was insane.\n\nBut now, Clarkson is on the other side of the reality TV game by switching from Idol contestant to the newest coach on The Voice. And fellow judge Adam Levine says that even though Clarkson comes across as a female powerhouse, she\u2019s a crier and wears her heart on her sleeve.\n\nShelton says that Clarkson cries so much there is a spray of spittle around her chair that you can actually see in the floor\u2019s reflection.\n\nJudge Alicia Keys adds that Clarkson is genuine, honest, and completely in her emotions and feelings. But, it\u2019s not a tactic, it\u2019s just who she is.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCatch Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson compete on new episodes of The Voice, Monday and Tuesday nights on NBC.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toni-Braxton-300x169.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bilie-lee-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-Voices-Kelly-Clarkson-Wonders-Why-Gwen-Stefani-Is-With-Her-Buddy-Blake-Shelton-Too.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pauley-Perrette-Mark-Harmon-NCIS-300x195.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-jr-wife-vanessa-trump-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Kandi-Burruss-300x233.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NeNe-Leakes-Cancer-Stricken-Husband-Gregg-Completes-6-Months-of-Chemotherapy-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-Donald-Trump-Nancy-Pelosi-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Voice-Head-Honcho-Carson-Daly-Tells-Blake-Shelton-Not-To-Let-Gwen-Stefani-Go-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/The-Voices-Kelly-Clarkson-Wonders-Why-Gwen-Stefani-Is-With-Her-Buddy-Blake-Shelton-Too.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/the-voices-kelly-clarkson-wonders-why-gwen-stefani-is-with-her-buddy-blake-shelton-too-126080/", "title": "\u2018The Voice\u2019s\u2019 Kelly Clarkson Wonders Why Gwen Stefani Is With Her Buddy Blake Shelton Too", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "blake shelton, gwen stefani, kelly clarkson, the voice,", "keywords": "celebrity news, blake shelton, gwen stefani, kelly clarkson, the voice,", "description": "Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson were friends long before their time together on The Voice.
