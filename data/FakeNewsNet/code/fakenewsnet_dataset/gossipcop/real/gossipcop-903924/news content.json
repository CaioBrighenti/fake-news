Westwick strenuously denies the allegations.\n\nProducers Mammoth Screen decided to reshoot parts of the series with another actor, 30-year-old English star Christian Cooke. Now director Sandra Goldbacher and producer Damien Timmer have explained in a new interview with Radio Times why the decision was made.\n\n\u201cHundreds and hundreds of people\u2019s work would have just gone,\u201d director Goldbacher says in the new issue of Radio Times, \u201cor been indefinitely delayed. Which would have been devastating for everyone.\u201d\n\nGoldbacher adds that she was encouraged by the example of director Ridley Scott, who recast and reshot Hollywood movie All the Money in the World with Christopher Plummer following allegations made against original star Kevin Spacey.\n\n\u201cI felt encouraged by Ridley Scott having done it. It was like a sort of talisman for us all: he\u2019s done it, so we can do it,\u201d she said.\n\nA trailer for the re-worked BBC series was recently released, including Cooke as character Mickey Argyll.\n\nGoldbacher and producer Damian Timmer explain in the new issue how they were able to bring the original cast and locations back for the re-shoots, despite the late notice and time constraints.\n\nWhile original filming took place in the summer, the re-shoots were conducted in winter. As a consequence, Timmer explains, \u201cthe technical challenges were reversed. This time, we had the snow, not the sun.\u201d\n\nBoth Ordeal by Innocence and All the Money in the World were re-cast in order for the production to go ahead. However, other projects including Netflix biopic Gore starring Spacey were shelved.\n\nTimmer says in the interview that the experience of Ordeal by Innocence shows that the television and film industry is able to adapt to meet specific challenges.\n\n\u201cEvery era throws up new challenges that impact on filming. You might always have shot a series in a location that suddenly becomes a terrorist zone. The industry adapts and finds ways of working around whatever the issues is at the time.\u201d\n\nOrdeal by Innocence will now be shown on BBC1 this Easter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article was originally published on 19 March 2018", "images": ["https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2016/08/115899.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/11/GettyImages-683065894-a3d3a12.jpg?quality=45&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/06/wimbledon-towels-footer2-39f3372.png?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/08/cropped-radiotimes-header-logo-419324b.png?quality=90&resize=265,54", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/03/15571521-high_res-ordeal-by-innocence-2497165.jpg?quality=45&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/03/15571521-high_res-ordeal-by-innocence-2497165.jpg?quality=45&crop=13px,16px,3577px,2383px&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/04/RT-cover-victoria-4506b72.png?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/12/John-Malkovich-as-Herclue-Poirot-in-The-ABC-Murders-f35f3d8.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/01/CA522.1-Radio-Times-ER-Guide-Cover-999d568.jpg?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/03/westwick-61f6134.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white"], "top_img": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/03/15571521-high_res-ordeal-by-innocence-2497165.jpg?quality=45&resize=620,413", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Gill"], "canonical_link": "https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-01-03/ordeal-by-innocence-recast-ed-westwick-christian-cooke-bbc-agatha-christie/", "title": "Ordeal by Innocence producers explain decision to reshoot BBC drama following Ed Westwick allegations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Ordeal by Innocence producers explain decision to recast Ed Westwick.
