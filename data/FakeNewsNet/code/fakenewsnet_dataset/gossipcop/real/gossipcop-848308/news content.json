Regardless of the nature of their visit, every single person \u2014 young or old, male or female \u2014 finds a way to weave the question into the discussion. Of course they never fail to mention it\u2019s (cough, cough) for their mom/wife/daughter/aunt/(insert any relationship) and I of course smile. Then again, I can\u2019t say I blame them, I\u2019ve lived in Southern California for nearly 20 years, and it\u2019s still really fun to find celebrities when you least expect it.\n\nNaturally, celebrity spotting is one of the biggest perks while traveling to the entertainment capital of the world. Here in L.A., celebrities are in their natural habit, and you don\u2019t need to venture very far at all to spot big name stars in the wild. Those looking to rub elbows with your favorite big screen sensation, teen dream boy bander, or rock star legend, can look no further because here is a list of the best celebrity hangouts in L.A.\n\nTip: Paparazzi travel in swarms and it\u2019s impossible to miss them. If you see them outside on the street, you have successfully entered \u201cThe Celeb Zone.\u201d\n\nWhere to Find Celebrities in L.A.\n\nCavatina\n\n1200 Alta Loma Rd, West Hollywood, CA 90069\n\nCelebrity sightings: This \u201cpaps-free zone\u201d hosts the likes of Matthew McConaughey, Ethan Hawke, Rhianna, Keith Richards, Ozzy Osbourne, U2, Harry Styles, and Leonardo DiCaprio, who have all been spotted lurking around this rock star oasis. During the summer, make sure to catch their Friday night series Live @SunsetMarquis because you never know who will jump up on stage.\n\nThe Restaurant at Chateau Marmont\n\n8221 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90046\n\nCelebrity sightings: Oh, the stories! Experience for yourself where the trouble I mean magic happens. Courtney Love, Anthony Bourdain, Liv Tyler, Rachel Zoe, Rob Lowe, Blake Shelton, Simon Le Bon, Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan, and Nicole Richie are known frequenting the Garden Terrace, but it\u2019s safe to say what happened at Chateau Marmont never happened.\n\nThe Grove\n\n189 The Grove Dr., Los Angeles, CA 90036\n\nCelebrity sightings: When in doubt, shop! Mark Wahlberg, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Garner, Kit Harington, Justin Bieber, Helen Mirren, Bella Thorne, Drew Barrymore, Mindy Kailing, Chris Cornell and every other star imaginable head to The Grove to do just that.

Oh, and some others like that Julia chick from Pretty Woman. What\u2019s her name? Oh, yeah\u2026Roberts.\n\nRunyon Canyon\n\n2000 N Fuller Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90046\n\nCelebrity sightings: Get your fitness on with the likes of Vanessa Hudgens, Gavin Rossdale, Kendall Jenner, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Biel, and Jake Gyllenhaal, all of whom have been seen hiking the trail. Dog optional.\n\nLAX Airport\n\n1 World Way, Los Angeles, CA 90045\n\nCelebrity sightings: Next time you find yourself at baggage claim or the TSA security line, take a look around for the likes of Taylor Swift, Emma Stone, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ryan Reynolds, Orlando Bloom, Ryan Gosling, Khloe Kardashian, Vince Vaughn, and Kate Hudson because you never know who just hopped off a commercial flight.\n\nMalibu\n\nMalibu, CA 90265\n\nCelebrity sightings: From P!nk and Corey Hart to Leann Rimes, Gerard Butler, Chris Martin, Robert Downey Jr., and Owen Wilson, you never know who you\u2019ll run into while shopping at Malibu Country Mart or lounging on Zuma Beach.\n\nPUMP / Villa Blanca\n\n8948 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, CA 90069\n\n9601 Brighton Way, Beverly Hills, CA 90210\n\nCelebrity sightings: Elton John, Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lawrence and basically every Bravo-lebrity ever, including Jiggy and Jax.\n\nStarbucks\n\nAny of them.

It\u2019s your chance to not only mix and mingle in the lobby, but chill poolside and watch the red carpet arrivals live!\n\nshare this article Tweet Pin It share this article\n\nYou may also enjoy:\n\nHilton Mom Voyage writers receive free night certificates to use at Hilton Hotels & Resorts worldwide.
