Hutchinson even sang a few lines himself.\n\n>> On AJC.com: What\u2019s up with the first 15 \u2018American Idol\u2019 winners?\n\nAnd the cliche is right in a sense: Poppe and Hutchinson are both winners because they are dating. The revelation shocked the audience and the judges just minutes before Ryan Seacrest named the winner.\n\n>> Watch the moment here\n\n\n\nKeith Stell, Hutchinson's pastor, said in an interview Monday night that he had kept the secret for weeks and was surprised that they chose to reveal it on air. \u201cThey just made this connection during Hollywood week,\u201d Stell said. \u201cTheir characters melded together. They share a lot in common.\u201d\n\nIndeed, they are both from small towns and are the same age.\n\nPoppe is the first female to win since season 12 and only the second in the past 10 seasons. She is also the first quirky singer-songwriter type to take home the prize.\n\n>> Read more trending news\n\nAt 10:16 p.m., the show eliminated Gabby Barrett. The versatile singer came in third.\n\nPoppe will appear on ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Tuesday morning, followed by \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan.\"\n\n>> On AJC.com: Read the full recap of Monday's season finale\n\nThe History Of American Idol\n\nThank you for reading the Dayton Daily News and for supporting local journalism.
