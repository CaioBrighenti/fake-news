The driver of the Ferrari, a 71-year-old man who has not been identified, was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe Ferrari also rolled over in the crash, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Haas and the BMW driver, a 50-year-old woman, were both taken to the hospital. LAPD says Haas, a six-time winner on the PGA Tour, was seriously hurt but did not suffer life-threatening injuries.\n\nNBC reports Wilson, the 46-year-old star of movies like \"Old School\" and \"Idiocracy,\" was indirectly involved in the incident. He was driving on Chautauqua Boulevard when the Ferrari clipped his vehicle before colliding with the BMW.\n\nWilson does not appear to have suffered any serious injuries. It's unclear how much damage occurred on his vehicle.\n\nGolf Digest reports Haas, ranked among the top 100 golfers, was in the area for this week's Genesis Open at the Riviera County Club. A source told the magazine that he is \"not good,\" but is in stable condition; his management has yet to say if he'll still play in the tournament.\n\nOfficials have not said what caused the crash or detailed any events leading up to the collision. An investigation is ongoing.", "images": ["http://image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width600/img/us-news/photo/2018/02/14/bill-haas-luke-wilson-94e7aca34b47b765.jpg", "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/BX14cwavfAkfs6RZ_NkMu7x0Y54=/1200x0/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width2048/img/us-news/photo/2018/02/14/bill-haas-luke-wilson-94e7aca34b47b765.jpg", "https://www.syracuse.com/pb/resources/dist/syracuse/images/logos/logo_main_inverse.svg", "https://www.syracuse.com/pb/resources/dist/common/images/ps-images/ad-choices-arrow.png", "https://www.syracuse.com/pb/resources/dist/common/images/footer-logo-advance.svg", "https://www.syracuse.com/pb/resources/dist/common/images/icons/close.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/BX14cwavfAkfs6RZ_NkMu7x0Y54=/1200x0/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width2048/img/us-news/photo/2018/02/14/bill-haas-luke-wilson-94e7aca34b47b765.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Geoff Herbert", "Gherbert Syracuse.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2018/02/bill_haas_car_crash_luke_wilson.html", "title": "Golfer Bill Haas, actor Luke Wilson involved in fatal car crash", "meta_data": {"Description": "LAPD says Haas was seriously hurt.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 116541301723191}, "title": "Golfer Bill Haas, actor Luke Wilson involved in fatal car crash", "og": {"description": "LAPD says Haas was seriously hurt.", "url": "https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2018/02/bill_haas_car_crash_luke_wilson.html", "site_name": "syracuse.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/BX14cwavfAkfs6RZ_NkMu7x0Y54=/1200x0/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width2048/img/us-news/photo/2018/02/14/bill-haas-luke-wilson-94e7aca34b47b765.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-14T15:52:27.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-14T11:52:27.000Z", "author": "Geoff Herbert", "section": "U.S. & World, Sports, Celebrity News, Entertainment, CNY & Pro Golf, Movies News", "tag": "@topstory, Bill Haas, celebrity news, golf, Luke Wilson, movies, Top Entertainment, Top Sports"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "LAPD says Haas was seriously hurt.", "image": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/BX14cwavfAkfs6RZ_NkMu7x0Y54=/1200x0/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width2048/img/us-news/photo/2018/02/14/bill-haas-luke-wilson-94e7aca34b47b765.jpg", "title": "Golfer Bill Haas, actor Luke Wilson involved in fatal car crash", "site": "@syracusedotcom", "creator": "@deafgeoff"}, "article_publication_name": "syracuse.com", "article_author": "Geoff Herbert | gherbert@syracuse.com", "article_date_original": "Wednesday, February 14, 2018, 11:52 AM", "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, February 14, 2018, 07:52 AM"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518623547.0, "source": "https://www.syracuse.com", "summary": ""}
