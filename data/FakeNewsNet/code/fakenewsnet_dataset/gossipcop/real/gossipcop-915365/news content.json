In our four-year history of working together on this incredible show, these accusations have NEVER been revealed or discussed directly with me or anyone at Amazon. Therefore, I can only surmise that the investigation against me was deeply flawed and biased toward the toxic politicized atmosphere that afflicted our set,\u201d he added.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amber Tamblyn Defends Husband David Cross Amid Allegation of Racism: \u2018He Said He Was Sorry\u2019\n\nHe continued, \u201cAs I have consistently stated, I deeply regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone and I will continue to vehemently defend myself. I also deeply regret that this ground-breaking show, which changed so many lives, is now in jeopardy. That, to me, is the biggest heartbreak.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jeffrey Tambor Denies Allegations of Sexual Harassment: \u2018I Have Never Been a Predator\u2019\n\nThe same day Amazon parted ways with Tambor, Soloway spoke of her \u201crespect and admiration\u201d for Tambor\u2019s accusers.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the many trans people who have supported our vision for Transparent since its inception and remain heartbroken about the pain and mistrust their experience has generated in our community,\u201d she said in a statement, according to EW. \u201cWe are taking definitive action to ensure our workplace respects the safety and dignity of every individual, and are taking steps to heal as a family.\u201d", "images":
