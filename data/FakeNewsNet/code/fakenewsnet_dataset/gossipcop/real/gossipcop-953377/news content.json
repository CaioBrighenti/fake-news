I\u2019m absolutely dead and ready to eat something.\u201d\n\nBy the end of her workout, Cuoco called it all \u201cfrickin\u2019 awesome.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Instagram / @normancook)\n\nCuoco, who plays Penny on Big Bang Theory, tied the knot this past July with equestrian, Karl Cook. Cuoco first revealed the news on Instagram in the form of a black-and-white image of her and her athlete husband. However, five days after the big wedding, the 32-year-old told fans the two would have to cut their honeymoon for the procedure that was planned a year prior.\n\nPosting a photo from her hospital bed, Cuoco thanked fans for their love and support, and later took to the Instagram Stories feature, letting fans know about her recovery time.\n\n\u201cFor everyone asking, because everyone\u2019s been so sweet and worried about me, this is a planned surgery I\u2019ve had for over a year,\u201d she explained. \u201cI hurt it over a year ago, did not need immediate surgery. So, I brilliantly planned it five days after our wedding. Right, babe?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust brilliant, hun,\u201d chimed in Cook, who was in the room with Cuoco.\n\n\u201cI knew I\u2019d have a babysitter,\u201d Cuoco joked.\n\n\u201cNo horsies for a minute,\u201d she added. \u201cBut time to lay low and hopefully not kill this guy [Cook], or him kill me. Thanks for the love!\u201d\n\nThe actress shared that she\u2019s currently \u201cin a pretty big cast,\u201d and that her recovery will take around four to six weeks.\n\nCuoco has been known to stay in shape, recently telling Women's Health Magazine about her go-to fitness outlet: hot yoga.\n\n\u201cI tried spinning, I tried running, I tried yoga, I tried Pilates,\u201d Cuoco said. \u201cI realized I don\u2019t like running\u2026 I refuse to do it. I like spinning, so I try to mix that in. When I found hot yoga, I fell in love with it and was like, this is my thing.\u201d\n\nShe also said she has to buckle down on her diet and put in a lot more effort into staying fit than she used to.\n\n\u201cBottom line is, you know, I\u2019m not 21 anymore,\u201d Cuoco said. \u201cIt used to be so easy, I didn\u2019t have to do as much. Now, it\u2019s part of my day \u2014 working out is part of my day, eating right is part of my day.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2018/07/kaley-cuoco-workout-01-20041093.jpeg", "https://media.popculture.com/2019/07/serena-williams-halep-wimbledon-getty-20065033-239x108.jpeg", "https://media.popculture.com/2018/07/kaley-cuoco-workout-02-20041094.jpeg", "https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/kaley-cuoco-abs-goldsheep-20036638-640x320.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/kaley-cuoco-abs-goldsheep-20036638-640x320.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/2018/07/20/kaley-cuoco-workout-exercise-shoulder-surgery/", "title": "Kaley Cuoco Hits the Gym 2 Weeks After Shoulder Surgery", "meta_data": {"description": "After going in for surgery on her right shoulder following a romantic wedding in San Diego, California, Big Bang Theory actress, Kaley Cuoco is back to her active lifestyle.Cuoco took to Instagram on Thursday to share an update with fans through the Stories feature that she is on the mend by [...]", "keywords": "Kaley Cuoco,The Big Bang Theory", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "ComicBook", "creator": "ComicBook", "title": "Kaley Cuoco Hits the Gym 2 Weeks After Shoulder Surgery", "description": "After going in for surgery on her right shoulder following a romantic wedding in San Diego, [...]", "image": "https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/kaley-cuoco-abs-goldsheep-20036638-640x320.jpeg"}, "og": {"title": "Kaley Cuoco Hits the Gym 2 Weeks After Shoulder Surgery", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/2018/07/20/kaley-cuoco-workout-exercise-shoulder-surgery/", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/kaley-cuoco-abs-goldsheep-20036638-640x320.jpeg", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Celebrity", "description": "After going in for surgery on her right shoulder following a romantic wedding in San Diego, [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532059200.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
