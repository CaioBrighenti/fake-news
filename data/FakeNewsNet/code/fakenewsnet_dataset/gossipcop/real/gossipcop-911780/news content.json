There is also a large selection of shops.\n\nBut it is the sheer volume of condoms that has caught the local media's attention in South Korea, where the games will be held.\n\nAccording to the Korea Biomedical Review, the condoms have been donated \"mostly by domestic developer Convenience\" and will be \"the biggest amount ever distributed at the Winter Games.\"\n\nThe total cost of Convenience's donation will be $93,370 (\u00a365,649). Organizers will supply each athlete's residence with condoms.\n\nOthers will be available in \"condom baskets\" situated in the towns of Gangneung and Pyeongchang, in the Main Press Centre and Media Village, as well as in the stadia used for events.\n\nCondoms were first publicly distributed at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Since then, the stockpiling has increased. At the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, 100,000 condoms were supplied.\n\nInterestingly, the mass stockpiling of condoms could be in response to the emergence and availability of dating apps.\n\nTinder, after all, played a role at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janiero, as use of the app \"skyrocketed\" by 129% during the games, according to the Tinder spokeswoman Rosette Pambakian.\n\nEven athletes confirmed using it. Marcus Nyman, who competed as a judoka in Rio, said: \"A lot of athletes [used] the app.\"\n\nThe Winter Olympics begin next Friday.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a75067024d50524008b4dfd-750-500.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a75068eaf61d85b028b4d63-960-480.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a75068eaf61d85b028b4d63-960-480.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/winter-olympics-the-olympic-village-is-stocked-with-110000-condoms-that-is-37-per-athlete-2018-2", "title": "The Olympic Village will be stocked with 37 condoms per athlete \u2014 and it could be because of Tinder", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-02-02", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-02", "news_keywords": "Winter Olympics, winter olympics 2018, Olympic Village, Condom, Condoms, Olympics, Tinder, Alan Dawson", "sailthru.tags": "Winter Olympics, winter olympics 2018, Olympic Village, Condom, Condoms, Olympics, Tinder, Alan Dawson", "description": "The prevalence of dating apps like Tinder could be one reason for the stockpiling of condoms at this month's Winter Olympics.", "sailthru.description": "The prevalence of dating apps like Tinder could be one reason for the stockpiling of condoms at this month's Winter Olympics.", "title": "The Olympic Village will be stocked with 37 condoms per athlete \u2014 and it could be because of Tinder", "sailthru.verticals": "sportspage, thelife", "sailthru.title": "The Olympic Village will be stocked with 37 condoms per athlete \u2014 and it could be because of Tinder", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a75068eaf61d85b028b4d63-960-480.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a750685107290d91a8b4be7-750-563.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a750685107290d91a8b4be7-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Sports", "sailthru.author": "Alan Dawson", "og": {"title": "The Olympic Village will be stocked with 37 condoms per athlete \u2014 and it could be because of Tinder", "description": "The prevalence of dating apps like Tinder could be one reason for the stockpiling of condoms at this month's Winter Olympics.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/winter-olympics-the-olympic-village-is-stocked-with-110000-condoms-that-is-37-per-athlete-2018-2", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a75068eaf61d85b028b4d63-960-480.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Alan Dawson", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/winter-olympics-the-olympic-village-is-stocked-with-110000-condoms-that-is-37-per-athlete-2018-2", "title": "The Olympic Village will be stocked with 37 condoms per athlete \u2014 and it could be because of Tinder", "description": "The prevalence of dating apps like Tinder could be one reason for the stockpiling of condoms at this month's Winter Olympics.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a75068eaf61d85b028b4d63-960-480.jpg", "creator": "@alandawsonsport", "site": "@SportsInsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "The Olympic Village will be stocked with 37 condoms per athlete \u2014 and it could be because of Tinder": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517547600.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
