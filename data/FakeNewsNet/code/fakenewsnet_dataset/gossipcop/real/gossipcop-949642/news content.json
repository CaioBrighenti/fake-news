We set each other free, and people really struggle with that. The things that Jada needs to be happy I\u2019m not going to agree with them all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve truly learned the definition of unconditional love,\u201d he added. \u201cI love you, I support you, I\u2019m going to help you be happy no matter what. I don\u2019t have to like it. I describe it as the day the deal breakers are gone. We don\u2019t have any deal breakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd to me that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\u201d Pinkett Smith said. \u201cI always knew I\u2019m not marriage material. What I did know is I\u2019m a ride or die chick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you are is the best friend that I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d the actor chimed in. \u201cYou\u2019re the best partner I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith Will Smith/Instagram\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes that gets lost in marriage. I think for many years you and I\u2026 we tried really hard,\u201d Pinkett Smith responded. \u201cWhat we have between us is family and friendship. We are in a union no matter what. We talk about any and everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you go to sleep at night knowing you have an unbreakable bond, and an unbreakable friendship, an unbreakable connection \u2014 that\u2019s how you want to go to sleep every night,\u201d Smith added.\n\nRELATED: Will Smith Says He and Jada Pinkett \u2018Broke Up Within Our Marriage and Got Back Together Again\u2019\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jada Pinkett Smith Just Jumped Out of a Plane in Dubai \u2014 and It Was All Will\u2019s Idea!\n\nPinkett Smith told PEOPLE earlier in October that she does not find them uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really how we talk on a daily basis,\u201d Pinkett Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not difficult for us. It\u2019s how we communicate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always leave feeling like I\u2019ve learned something from them,\u201d Banfield-Jones said. \u201cI love coming to their house. I love coming to L.A. and spending time with them because I just leave so filled up.\u201d", "images":
