It's mostly thanks to Jenner's makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, which launched in 2016. Forbes estimated it is worth $800 million \u2014 and Jenner owns 100% of it.\n\nOn top of that, Jenner has made millions in sponsorship deals, and about $60 million in after-tax dividends from her company, according to Forbes.\n\nForbes said that Kardashian West's own cosmetics company, KKW Beauty, has made $100 million since last June. Her worth also stems from her years as a public figure and her mobile-gaming app, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, according to Forbes.\n\nForbes said that Jenner could become the youngest self-made billionaire ever in another year, besting Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Snap's Evan Spiegel.\n\nThe chart below shows just how much Jenner is worth compared to Kardashian West:", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b462ab25ea10823008b4700-750-375.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b4629bd062a6b27008b46de-750-500.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b462ab25ea10823008b4700-750-375.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Travis Clark", "Jenny Cheng"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kylie-jenner-net-worth-compared-to-sister-kim-kardashian-west-chart-2018-7", "title": "This striking chart shows how much bigger Kylie Jenner's net worth is than sister and fellow mogul Kim Kardashian West's", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-07-14", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-14", "news_keywords": "Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Networth, BI Graphics, Travis Clark, Jenny Cheng", "sailthru.tags": "Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Networth, BI Graphics, Travis Clark, Jenny Cheng", "description": "Kylie Jenner is worth $900 million compared to her half-sister Kim Kardashian West, who is worth $350 million.
