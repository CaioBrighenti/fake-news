In an interview with InStyle , the Black-ish star says she rocks a red lip at the gym, which is a seriously bold, amazing move.\n\n\"I do the Tracy Anderson Method, so there's a lot of mirror work involved,\" she told InStyle . \"When I see my red lips reflecting back at me, I'm like, 'Yeah, girl, that's right!'\"\n\nYeah girl, indeed. This isn't the first time Ross has made her affinity for wearing red lipstick while working out known\u2014she posted a video of some booty exercises at a Tracy Anderson studio in March with the hashtag #redlipfit (and some incredible sparkly leggings).\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nIt takes some killer confidence to work a red lip while you're sweating it out, especially considering Tracy Anderson Method is known for its dance cardio -infused classes (which can already feel pretty vulnerable to many people). But it sounds like Ross is leaning right into it with her red lipstick look, and straight-up owning that pop of color.\n\nShe might be onto something with the shade of her lipstick, too\u2014the color red has long been associated with confidence, and if that \"you got this\" feeling helps her push a little harder or squeeze in a few more reps, more power to her. (For the record, her lipstick of choice is MAC's matte Ruby Woo .)\n\nAnd while you might've heard that wearing makeup while working out isn't great for your skin, it turns out that lipstick is actually the one product you can safely get away during a sweaty workout. While dermatologists warn that foundations and tinted moisturizers can mix with sweat and clog pores, potentially creating breakouts, and eye makeup can run into your eyes and irritate them, there's no harm in lipstick because your lips don't have sweat glands.\n\nSo if rocking a red lip like Ross helps pump up your workout, have at it. And if not, she's also proven that red lipstick is definitely not required to go all-in, especially when your jam comes on (judging by her enthusiasm here).\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nRelated:", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5ae786345635d315eb4326cb/4:3/h_130/DSC_9427.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a6b4f2b080d59414359e815/4:3/h_130/fitness-routine.jpg", "https://collector-PX69t0oUvr.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX69t0oUvr", "https://media.self.com/photos/5c14016b71c2e92ac17cdab8/4:3/h_130/GettyImages-1012617912.jpg", "https://www.self.com/images/self-starter-failsafe.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:1/pass/ross.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:1/pass/ross.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexa Tucker", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/tracee-ellis-ross-red-lipstick-during-workout", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Just Made a Strong Case for Wearing Red Lipstick During a Workout", "meta_data": {"generator": "autopilot-build-Sat Jul 13 2019 16:20:39 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "Alexa Tucker", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond&#233; Nast 2019", "description": "Actress Tracee Ellis Ross said that she wears red lipstick for a major confidence boost when she works out at hotspots like Tracy Anderson Method.", "keywords": "news,Tracee Ellis Ross,Tracy Anderson,Celebrity Fitness", "news_keywords": "Fitness,Shape Up,news,Tracee Ellis Ross,Tracy Anderson,Celebrity Fitness", "og": {"description": "Get it, girl.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:1/pass/ross.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Just Made a Strong Case for Wearing Red Lipstick During a Workout", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/tracee-ellis-ross-red-lipstick-during-workout"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "Get it, girl.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:1/pass/ross.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "SELFmagazine", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Just Made a Strong Case for Wearing Red Lipstick During a Workout"}, "fb": {"pages": 8908243810, "admins": "1515690174,835972574,1301604672,505160,43600163"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
