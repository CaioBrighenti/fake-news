On The Challenge\u2019s Tuesday, August 29 episode, it was revealed that former champs Veronica Portillo and Rachel Robinson secretly dated for three years.\n\nThe shocking former relationship wasn\u2019t revealed by the duo, however, but by Robinson\u2019s ex and Challenge alum Aneesa Ferriera.\n\n\u201cYou are so f\u2013king beautiful, Veronica. I\u2019d f\u2013k you. And that\u2019s it,\u201d Ferriera said to Portillo. \u201cThat\u2019s what it really comes to. Her ex-girlfriend is my ex-girlfriend.\u201d\n\nFerreira explained that when she and Robinson, who began their romance after filming season six of the MTV series, eventually split, Robinson went on to date Portillo.\n\nPortillo was less than thrilled to have her past relationship exposed, explaining in a confessional interview: \u201cI feel honestly bad for Rachel for me to come back years later and talk about it when I didn\u2019t talk about when we\u2019re together, I feel like that\u2019s really disrespectful.\u201d\n\nFollowing her admission, Ferriera asked Portillo to go to bed with her \u201cas friends,\u201d explaining: \u201cI want to hold you like a little kitten.\u201d\n\nRobinson has moved on from both relationships. She announced in May that she is expecting twins with her partner, Natalie Gee. \u201cI know it has been a very long time since my last blog post, and I have taken a little hiatus from social media. Well, it is well deserved with the news I am about to share,\u201d the two-time champ wrote at the time. \u201cNatalie and I will be welcoming twins in the fall,and we are excited to share the news with you all!\u201d\n\nThe Challenge: XXX airs on MTV Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
