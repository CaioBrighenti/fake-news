Both Tom and Luann are addressing the speculation in a new statement.\n\n\u201cWe are together in Sag [Harbor] and are happy. He went to meet mutual friends for drinks. There is no story there,\" Luann told Page Six (who also first reported the sighting) on Monday, with Tom adding, \u201cLuann and I had a great weekend together in the Hamptons. We went to a dinner party together and I went out to meet our mutual friends for drinks after. Luann knew where I was and who I was with. There is no story here.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Tom's rep calls the gossip \u201ctotal rubbish,\u201d adding that Tom did go out and \u201che was with a group of friends, and there was no clandestine meeting with a blond woman. He wants to make his marriage work.\u201d\n\nJust last month, the couple addressed rumors that their marriage was in trouble less than a year after they wed on New Year's Eve in Palm Beach. \"Tom and I are in love and marriage takes work. We are working on this together,\" Luann told The Daily Dish about the chatter their marriage was facing hard times.\n\nUPDATE, August 3, 2017: Luann confirmed she and Tom are divorcing in a statement on Twitter.\n\nYou can catch Luann every Wednesday at 9/8c on RHONY.
