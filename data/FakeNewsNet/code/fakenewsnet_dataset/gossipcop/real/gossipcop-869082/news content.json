If you somehow missed what happened or just need a refresher, we highly recommend you revisit the moment in the clip above, because it just needs to be seen to be believed.\n\nLooking back on the incident while live tweeting the episode, Shannon seemed to suggest that one OC Housewife in particular was responsible for the drama breaking out. And no, it's not Kelly Dodd, with whom she argued at the restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon seemed to point the finger at Lydia McLaughlin since she extended the invitation to Kelly in the first place. \"Nothing would have happened if Lydia hadn't invited Kelly,\" Shannon tweeted, adding that \"it looks like [Lydia] likes to stir the pot.\"\n\nBecause it looks like she likes to stir the pot. And she didn't tell us that she invited Kelly. \u2014 Shannon Beador (@ShannonBeador) July 25, 2017\n\n\"My friend Kelly doesn't get along w/ Tamra and Shannon\" yet Lydia is going to invite her to a dinner that she didn't even plan?#potstirrer \u2014 Shannon Beador (@ShannonBeador) July 25, 2017\n\nHowever, Shannon is owning up to her part in the drama as well. \"Had a hard day and felt totally ambushed. I go to QW often and hadn't seen Kelly anywhere in 6 mos,\" she tweeted. \"Not happy about my yelling tho #imhuman.\"\n\nHad a hard day and felt totally ambushed. I go to QW often and hadn't seen Kelly anywhere in 6 mos. Not happy about my yelling tho #imhuman \u2014 Shannon Beador (@ShannonBeador) July 25, 2017\n\nShannon also tweeted that she wishes she \"handled everything differently\" at The Quiet Woman.\n\nI get it. Wish I handled everything differently! \u2014 Shannon Beador (@ShannonBeador) July 25, 2017\n\nMeghan King Edmonds, who wasn't present for the meal, tweeted that she also thought it was \"so odd\" for Lydia to invite Kelly to the get-together when she knew she didn't get along with Shannon and Tamra.\n\nWhy would Lydia invite Kelly if she doesn't get along with anyone??? That is so odd. \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Meghan King Edmonds (@MeghanKEdmonds) July 25, 2017\n\nLydia was shocked when Kelly walked in? But she invited her. And now Kelly \u201cdidn\u2019t know they\u2019d be there?\u201d What is going on?! \u2014 Meghan King Edmonds (@MeghanKEdmonds) July 25, 2017\n\nTamra also didn't understand why Lydia invited Kelly to the dinner.\n\nDidn't she tell kelly in the car that shannon and Tamra don't get along with kelly? Why would you invite her to a dinner that WE set up? \u2014 Tamra Judge (@TamraBarney) July 25, 2017\n\nAs for Lydia, she recently told Bravotv.com that she was completely taken aback by Shannon's reaction at The Quiet Woman. \"I thought [Peggy Sulahian] was gonna have a heart attack because I have never -- like I said the only time I met Shannon was at the party where she's yelling at me and runs away. And then I meet her again, and she's yelling at Kelly and in the bathroom and just the sight of her, I felt like she was gonna have a heart attack,\" she said. \"I don't know how else to describe it. It was very jarring... I don't understand her reaction.\"\n\nBut perhaps you'll be glad to know that all of this drama hasn't kept many of the RHOC ladies from returning to The Quiet Woman. Kelly recently told Bravotv.com that she still eats there \"all the time.\" In fact, Shannon and Tamra just paid a visit to the eatery on a double date with their husbands.\n\nThought we'd have dinner last night @thequietwomancdm where it all goes down tonight on #RHOC! \u2764\ufe0f Lots going on in this episode! \ud83d\ude31You don't want to miss it!
