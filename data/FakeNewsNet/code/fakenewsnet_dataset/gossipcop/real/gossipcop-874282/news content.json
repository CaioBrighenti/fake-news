And it\u2019s only clear that there\u2019s still much love between former couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.\n\nI mean, the guy teared up when she won her Best Actress Academy Award, for crying out loud! And both Emma and Andrew have said in numerous occasions that even after their split, they still love each other very much.\n\nWell, it seems like those weren\u2019t just empty words.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Stone has been making multiple trips to London to see Garfield perform in his play Angels in America. She\u2019s watched the show several times and allegedly \u201calways\u201d goes back for a backstage visit. \u201cThey have even been sneaking out of the back door holding hands,\u201d a source close to Garfield told the outlet.\n\nWhile Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. \u201cAndrew\u2019s feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,\u201d the source said.\n\nEmma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010\u2019s, these two were Hollywood\u2019s sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man. The couple went public in 2011, via the classy and showbiz means of a joint appearance during her Saturday Night Live monologue. Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.\n\nYet, here we are, cheering for Emma and Andrew once again.\n\n\u201cThe familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that they are back to being an official couple just yet, but the future is probably going to be something where they are together. It is basically just a matter of time,\u201d the source said.\n\nWe choose to remain optimistic!", "images": ["https://www.jetss.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ezra-miller-style-100x70.jpg",
