And for good reason. Inspired by the longline white tee she designed with Hanes for Justin Bieber\u2014a signature piece during the Believe tour and a wardrobe staple of Bieber\u2019s ever since\u2014the seven-shirt collection includes classic, cropped, and sleeveless styles, and is already being worn by Zendaya, Karlie Kloss, and Tracee Ellis Ross, among a slew of Welch\u2019s other celeb clients. Oh, and did we mention the campaign? Starring Bieber, Kaia Gerber, and Joan Smalls, it was a literal labor of love shot by Welch\u2019s husband, Matthew. \u201c[We] worked together the whole process, and I was so grateful to him,\u201d Welch says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait for everyone to see the images.\u201d Here at Coveteur HQ, we couldn\u2019t wait to see how Welch would style her shirts. This is, after all, the woman who dressed Ruth Negga in that impeccable Valentino for the Oscars, put Sarah Paulson in plunging custom Prada at the Emmys, and landed at number one on The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s 25 Most Powerful Stylists in Hollywood list\u2014so yes, we were taking notes. Our afternoon was a deep dive into optimal white-tee dressing, but also one that included talk of Welch\u2019s former career as a ma\u00eetre d\u2019, her love of Instagram, and what she\u2019s working on next.\n\nHer thoughts on her Hollywood Reporter nod: \u201cI\u2019m super pragmatic, so I was like, \u2018OK, great!... Now I have a job to prep.\u2019 But I\u2019m super proud of the year that I\u2019ve had, and the [Hollywood Reporter party] was such a fun night because I got to be with all of my peers. There\u2019s a group of us that are really close. We\u2019re competitive because you want to get the girl or the job, but there\u2019s so much room for everyone, so it was just a great celebration.\u201d The best part about her job: \u201cI love fashion, and I think designers are artists\u2014I know they are. To be able to work closely and develop relationships with Pierpaolo [Piccioli] or Nicholas [Ghesqui\u00e8re], and to have a dress made for a client\u2014I\u2019ll never get over it. I make sure my girls understand how baller and special it is, and to not ever take it for granted. I think that my favorite part of the job is that I get to be a conduit for designers\u2014to make sure [my work] is how they envision their look to be.\u201d\n\nWhat her personal white tee collection looks like: \u201cI fully cleaned out my closet, and I only own my own white tees now! But I probably had like, 50 before. And they were all trash, but I kept holding on to them. So now I have two of each of mine to start.\u201d How Hanes x Karla came about: \u201cWhen I created xKarla, the idea was that I didn\u2019t want to wait for a brand to come to me and say, \u2018Hey, do you want to be an ambassador?\u2019 I feel like it\u2019s a new way to collaborate where I say, \u2018I want to make this, I\u2019m going to find someone who it makes sense for me to make it with.\u2019 So that\u2019s what this is.\u201d Her tips on caring for a Hanes x Karla tee: \u201cI\u2019m so hard with [mine]. I just wear them, wear them, wear them. If it\u2019s not dirty, I\u2019m not going to wash it, so I don\u2019t wash after every wear. I think you should wear stuff and let it bag out a bit. And then machine-wash. Sometimes I air-dry, sometimes I just throw [them] in the dryer. They\u2019re tough. You can beat these ones up.\u201d\n\nWhat she learned from working in the service industry: \u201cI was a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 and a sommelier at a restaurant in Vancouver, and I loved it. I think you meet someone and you know they\u2019ve been a waiter or a server. There\u2019s something that makes you a better person, and you just have a better understanding of things. Service is important.\u201d Why she loves social media: \u201cI love teasing my husband because for the longest time he told me, \u2018You need to be on Instagram.\u2019 I was late to it, but now I love Instagram so much that he\u2019s always telling me to put my phone down. It\u2019s fun to share. Especially for me, because I\u2019m an introvert, but I\u2019m an extroverted introvert, and there is such a thing as that. It\u2019s this amazing way to [talk] to people who I\u2019d probably be too shy to say hi to. For better or worse, online is very much where our community is, and that\u2019s how we get our news and connect with other people.\u201d", "images": ["http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-20-627x940.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-1-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Shiseido_Colorgel-5-homepage-250x250.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-13-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-23-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-12-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-18-627x940.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-24-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-2-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-21-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-2-2-835x557.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch1-homepage.gif", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-3-627x940.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-8-627x940.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-15-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-4-835x1253.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1112425415570790&ev=PageView &noscript=1", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Karen_Elson-6-18-summer-dresses-in-our-cart-homepage-250x250.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch-16-835x1253.jpg", "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Montauk_Market_Story-8-shop-clothes-accessories-pack-for-vacation-sq-250x250.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-f3byk8QdGee2w.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=16440169&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch1-homepage.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://coveteur.com/2018/05/28/karla-welch-white-tee-styling-tips-justin-bieber-stylist/", "title": "Hollywood\u2019s Most Powerful Stylist Shows Us How to Wear a White Tee", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, user-scalable=1", "p": {"domain_verify": "6e7b9aef6e0a4a3be6ccfd54229329b5"}, "og": {"title": "Justin Bieber\u2019s Stylist, Karla Welch, Shares White Tee Styling Tips", "description": "Our afternoon with Karla Welch was spent chatting about white tee styling tips, her love of Instagram, and what she\u2019s working on next.", "url": "http://coveteur.com/2018/05/28/karla-welch-white-tee-styling-tips-justin-bieber-stylist/", "image": "http://coveteur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Karla_Welch1-homepage.gif", "type": "article", "site_name": "Coveteur", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2018-05-28T13:35:58-04:00"}, "description": "Our afternoon with Karla Welch was spent chatting about white tee styling tips, her love of Instagram, and what she\u2019s working on next.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/coveteur", "section": "Fashion", "published_time": "2018-05-28T12:00:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-28T13:35:58-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1246323488804172}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Our afternoon with Karla Welch was spent chatting about white tee styling tips, her love of Instagram, and what she\u2019s working on next.", "title": "Justin Bieber\u2019s Stylist, Karla Welch, Shares White Tee Styling Tips", "site": "@coveteur", "creator": "@coveteur"}, "pubexchange": {"title": "Hollywood\u2019s Most Powerful Stylist Shows Us How to Wear a White Tee"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.10.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527480000.0, "source": "http://coveteur.com", "summary": ""}
