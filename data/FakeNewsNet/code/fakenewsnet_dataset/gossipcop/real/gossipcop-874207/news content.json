Turns out, they\u2019ve suffered through their fair share of beauty blunders too, as JoJo Fletcher was all too happy to share with People.\n\nAccording to the 26-year-old, her makeup and brow game has drastically improved since her stint on Ben Higgins\u2019s season of The Bachelor. \u201cIt\u2019s night and day how much better I\u2019ve gotten at putting on my own makeup\u2026If you would have seen my eyebrows, they would have been a mess, I never paid attention to them,\u201d she confessed. She also got real about how she fixed the problem, saying, \u201c\u2026 Just knowing not to overfill them or overline them, and not making them too dark [is something I\u2019ve learned].\u201d\n\nIf your eyebrows are already on fleek (jealous!) but you\u2019re struggling with your skincare routine, Fletcher has some tips there too. She\u2019s a longtime user of St. Ives\u2019s scrubs (\u201cI think it was the first scrub I ever used. It was also Jordan\u2019s, which is really funny,\u201d), but says she\u2019s always trying new products. \u201cI think some people are scared to try a bunch of products, but fortunately my skin isn\u2019t very sensitive, so I experiment with everything.\u201d\n\nStill, her overall routine stays pretty much the same: \u201cI\u2019m always washing my face in the morning, I do a toner, serum. Sunscreen is really important. And then just moisturize.\u201d\n\nAs for her beauty bag staples, Fletcher says, \u201cI love a good face mist, a moisturizer, Chapstick. The basics so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m\u2026 going to completely dry out because I travel a lot.\u201d\n\nSounds like our kinda\u2019 gal!\n\nWhat\u2019s your biggest beauty blunder?
