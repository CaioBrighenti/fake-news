It\u2019s a special way to connect and the right film can create a bond that lasts for decades. However, sometimes this plan backfires and you end up showing your child a movie that you forgot is a little too inappropriate for them. That\u2019s exactly what Paul Rudd keeps doing.\n\nRudd appeared as a guest on Late Night with Seth Meyers and the Ant-Man actor explained to Meyers that he has a terrible habit of showing his kids movies that they are way too young to watch. It all started when he showed his then 4-year-old son Jack The Jerk, forgetting that this undisputed comedy masterpiece was rated \u2018R\u2019 for a reason. Over the years, he said, it\u2019s only gotten worse.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn fact, he admitted to making the same mistake twice with Stepbrothers, showing it to both Jack and his daughter Darby, and forgetting both times about the scene where Will Ferrell puts his ballsack on John C. Reilly\u2019s drum kit (not to mention the entire \u201cBoats and Hoes\u201d sequence). But none of these incidents compare to his admission that he showed his daughter Faces of Death, which is literally just a movie about different ways people die. Based on Rudd\u2019s telling of these stories, however, it doesn\u2019t seem like he scarred his kids too badly \u23e4 at least they didn\u2019t have nightmares.", "images": ["https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-29-at-9.jpg?q=65&enable=upscale&w=1200", "https://www.fatherly.com/wp-content/themes/grandfather/images/fatherly-icon-white.svg", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/metallica-childrensbook.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=141&h=141", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/metallica-childrensbook.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=100&h=100", "https://www.fatherly.com/wp-content/themes/grandfather/images/preloader.gif", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rickandmorty-contest.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=100&h=100", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-29-at-9.jpg?q=65&enable=upscale&w=600", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lionkingreviews-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=141&h=141", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lizard-loser-cakefail-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=141&h=141", "https://www.fatherly.com/wp-content/themes/grandfather/images/xfinity-logo.png", "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lizard-loser-cakefail-header.jpg?q=65&fit=crop&crop=smart&enable=upscale&w=100&h=100"], "top_img": "https://images.fatherly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-29-at-9.jpg?q=65&enable=upscale&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Blake Harper"], "canonical_link": "https://www.fatherly.com/news/paul-rudd-shows-kids-inappropriate-movies/", "title": "Paul Rudd Loves Showing His Kids Inappropriate Movies", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 1667245973359975, "pages": 348596051860210}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "In an interview with Seth Meyers, the 'Ant-Man' actor admitted that he has a bad habit of showing his two kids R-rated movies.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Paul Rudd's Favorite Part of Being a Dad?
