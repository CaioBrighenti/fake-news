But then the drama went on to do something that few recent breakout freshman series have accomplished: it became an even bigger hit in Season 2, where it was the highest-rated entertainment broadcast series in the adults 18-49 demographic last season, with a 5.4 rating.\n\nAfter avoiding the dreaded sophomore slump, This Is Us returns tonight for Season 3, and NBC\u2014which won\u2019t have the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics or Thursday Night Football to help inflate it this season\u2014will be counting on the show to help keep it on top in the 18-49 demo for what would be the third straight season.\n\nRobert Greenblatt, in an interview before he announced yesterday that he was stepping down as NBC Entertainment chairman after seven years, said that This Is Us shows the power of broadcast TV, which is \u201cthe only place where you can gather a huge group of people together for a shared experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen 12 to 14 million people watch America\u2019s Got Talent in the summer, or more than that watch This Is Us in the fall or spring, that\u2019s an extraordinary cultural achievement.\u201d\n\nWhile Greenblatt scuttled the show\u2019s Thursday move last year after realizing the extent to which Thursday Night Football would disrupt the show\u2019s narrative arc, he didn\u2019t consider relocating the show to Thursday this season, after the network lost Thursday Night Football to Fox.\n\n\u201cWe felt, by this point, that it\u2019s a Tuesday staple, for I\u2019m happy to say a large part of the country. We also got some nice traction on Thursday with Will & Grace, and The Good Place is really coming into its own,\u201d said Greenblatt. \u201cSo we thought, rather than jumble the cards again, let\u2019s keep a good thing going on Tuesday and let\u2019s build more of a good thing on Thursday. We\u2019re really excited about putting [Law & Order:] SVU on Thursday at 10, which is a great thing for that night also. There\u2019s a lot to be said for stability on your schedule.\u201d\n\nAs for how the show was able to avoid stumbling in Season 2, \u201cwe have extraordinary writers and [creator] Dan Fogelman is just the greatest sort of visionary,\u201d said Greenblatt. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a creator who\u2019s as far advanced in plotting a series than he is. He\u2019s weaving in elements from seasons four, five and six, which haven\u2019t even been completely conceived yet. But he knows where all these stories are going.\u201d\n\nFogelman \u201cknew from the beginning of the first season what the second season was meant to be: the year of what happened to [Milo Ventimiglia\u2019s character] Jack, and his death. We had the Super Bowl [last season] and we knew early on we were going to make that the ultimate episode in the middle of the season,\u201d said Greenblatt. \u201cSo there were a couple of things that came together that made Season 2 as anticipated as that first season was.\u201d\n\nNBC thinks the show\u2019s momentum will continue this season. \u201cI feel very bullish about Season 3 for a lot of reasons, which will remain sort of mysterious because I don\u2019t want to give anything away,\u201d said Greenblatt. \u201cBut there\u2019s some extraordinary things he\u2019s going to do this year.\u201d", "images": ["https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/jasonlynch1.jpg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/go-beyond-cbp-PAGE-2019-640x360.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%20360'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/betc-netflix-easter-eggs-feature-2019-640x360.jpg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AdobeStock-webinar-080119-credit.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dandad-new-blood-swimming-hed-page-2019-640x360.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201320%20660'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/AdWeek/assets/images/global/adweek-header-wt.png", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Adweek40.svg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HL_LG_HERO-640x360.jpg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NextTECH_homesitecard3-300px.png", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/brand-character-CONTENT-2019-640x360.jpg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jeremy-renner-jeep-hed-page-2019-640x360.png", "https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/themes/AdWeek/assets/images/global/Adweek40_footer.svg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/top-talent-adtech-CONTENT-2019-640x360.jpg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/thisisus-s2-PAGE-2018.jpg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/thisisus-s2-PAGE-2018-600x315.jpg", "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/adweek-collage-640x360.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/thisisus-s2-PAGE-2018-600x315.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/after-avoiding-the-sophomore-slump-this-is-us-is-nbcs-best-hope-to-maintain-its-demo-lead/", "title": "After Avoiding the Sophomore Slump, This Is Us Is NBC\u2019s Best Hope to Maintain Its Demo Lead", "meta_data": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "lytics": {"topics": "aw:programming-performance"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@adweek", "title": "After Avoiding the Sophomore Slump, This Is Us Is NBC\u2019s Best Hope to Maintain Its Demo Lead", "description": "The network didn\u2019t consider relocating the show to Thursday, as it almost did last year.", "creator": "jasonlynch", "image": "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/thisisus-s2-PAGE-2018-600x315.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": "34404791,617231194", "pages": 126756847074, "app_id": 329778260413541}, "og": {"title": "After Avoiding the Sophomore Slump, This Is Us Is NBC\u2019s Best Hope to Maintain Its Demo Lead", "description": "The network didn\u2019t consider relocating the show to Thursday, as it almost did last year.", "url": "https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/after-avoiding-the-sophomore-slump-this-is-us-is-nbcs-best-hope-to-maintain-its-demo-lead/", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/thisisus-s2-PAGE-2018-600x315.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=570229326", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The network didn\u2019t consider relocating the show to Thursday, as it almost did last year."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.adweek.com", "summary": ""}
