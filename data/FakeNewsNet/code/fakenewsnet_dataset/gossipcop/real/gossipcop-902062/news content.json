May 19's royal wedding has easily been one of the year's biggest events, not to mention a huge moment in the history of bridal fashion and beauty. Now, nearly 12 hours into the day, the couple can finally put their feet up. Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.\n\nThe freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated. Markle's reception dress, a long white gown made of silk crepe by British designer Stella McCartney, featured a halter-style neckline and the same type of effortless elegance as every other element of the bride's wedding-day look.\n\nSteve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nHarry, on the other hand, changed out of his official frockcoat uniform and into a classic black tuxedo, complete with a black bowtie around his neck and an adorable just-married grin across his face.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5b00732937efa915577431e3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Meghan%252520Markle%252520Prince%252520Harry%252520second%252520wedding%252520dress%252520Stella%252520McCartney%252520royal%252520wedding%2525203.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d02741cec86fe22b708f421/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/space-nk-new.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03c0adf1007c2917fdcdac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-baby-phat-forever-21.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b00732dae275167b1655e54/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Meghan%252520Markle%252520Prince%252520Harry%252520second%252520wedding%252520dress%252520Stella%252520McCartney%252520royal%252520wedding%2525202.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b0074ebff026d29aff79600/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan%2520Markle%2520Prince%2520Harry%2520second%2520wedding%2520dress%2520Stella%2520McCartney%2520royal%2520wedding%25204%2520cropped.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d07a421ab0933024a53a537/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/selma-blair-haircut.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b00768bff026d29aff79602/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Meghan%252520Markle%252520Prince%252520Harry%252520second%252520wedding%252520dress%252520Stella%252520McCartney%252520royal%252520wedding%2525205.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b001a513faf52258bf24127/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960061738.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03ccf0f1007cddbcfdcdb0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/poli.png"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b0074ebff026d29aff79600/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan%2520Markle%2520Prince%2520Harry%2520second%2520wedding%2520dress%2520Stella%2520McCartney%2520royal%2520wedding%25204%2520cropped.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Asia Milia Ware", "Kaleigh Fasanella", "Zachary Zane", "Sam Escoba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/meghan-markle-second-dress-royal-reception-stella-mccartney", "title": "Meghan Markle Debuts Second Dress for Royal Reception, a Stella McCartney Design", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Newlyweds Meghan Markle and Prince Harry departed Windsor Castle for the royal reception, with Markle having changed into her second dress: a gorgeous halter-style design by Stella McCartney.", "keywords": "Royal Wedding,Meghan Markle,wedding dress,bridal,Stella McCartney", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "The halter-style gown is a Stella McCartney design \u2014 and it's GORGEOUS.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b0074ebff026d29aff79600/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan%2520Markle%2520Prince%2520Harry%2520second%2520wedding%2520dress%2520Stella%2520McCartney%2520royal%2520wedding%25204%2520cropped.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Meghan Markle Debuts Her Second Dress for the Royal Reception", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/meghan-markle-second-dress-royal-reception-stella-mccartney"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The halter-style gown is a Stella McCartney design \u2014 and it's GORGEOUS.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b0074ebff026d29aff79600/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan%2520Markle%2520Prince%2520Harry%2520second%2520wedding%2520dress%2520Stella%2520McCartney%2520royal%2520wedding%25204%2520cropped.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Meghan Markle Debuts Her Second Dress for the Royal Reception"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
