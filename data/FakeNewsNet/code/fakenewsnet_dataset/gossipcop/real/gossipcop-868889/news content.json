After Ford accidentally clocked Gosling in the face amid a flurry of fake punches, Gosling said that \"2049\" director Denis Villeneuve told him, \"'Look at it this way \u2014 you just got hit by Indiana Jones.'\"\n\nFord and Gosling have since discussed the punch on several late-night shows.\n\nFord recounted the punch on \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" this week. \"I threw 80 punches,\" he said. \"Seventy-nine of them missed him, which is the way you're supposed to do it in a movie.\"\n\nLater in the week, Ford and Gosling revealed the actual image of the punch on the \"Graham Norton Show.\"\n\n\"That's the face of, 'Oh sh-t, I'm in deep doodoo,'\" Ford told Norton of the image.\n\nWatch a segment of the interview below:", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d39668351ccf89468b6a1e-1136-568.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d39645c68d7b701c8b6954-750-422.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d39668351ccf89468b6a1e-1136-568.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Lynch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/harrison-ford-punched-ryan-gosling-in-face-blade-runner-2049-2017-10", "title": "This photo shows Harrison Ford accidentally punching Ryan Gosling in the face on the 'Blade Runner 2049' set", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-10-03", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-03", "news_keywords": "Movies, Blade Runner 2049, Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, John Lynch", "sailthru.tags": "Movies, Blade Runner 2049, Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, John Lynch", "description": "As \"Blade Runner 2049\" draws critical acclaim, its stars, Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, have been talking about an accidental punch that occurred on its set.", "sailthru.description": "As \"Blade Runner 2049\" draws critical acclaim, its stars, Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, have been talking about an accidental punch that occurred on its set.", "title": "This photo shows Harrison Ford accidentally punching Ryan Gosling in the face on the 'Blade Runner 2049' set", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire, sai", "sailthru.title": "This photo shows Harrison Ford accidentally punching Ryan Gosling in the face on the 'Blade Runner 2049' set", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d39668351ccf89468b6a1e-1136-568.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d3965f351ccfd9008b749b-750-563.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d3965f351ccfd9008b749b-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "sailthru.author": "John Lynch", "og": {"title": "This photo shows Harrison Ford accidentally punching Ryan Gosling in the face on the 'Blade Runner 2049' set", "description": "As \"Blade Runner 2049\" draws critical acclaim, its stars, Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, have been talking about an accidental punch that occurred on its set.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/harrison-ford-punched-ryan-gosling-in-face-blade-runner-2049-2017-10", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d39668351ccf89468b6a1e-1136-568.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "John Lynch", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/harrison-ford-punched-ryan-gosling-in-face-blade-runner-2049-2017-10", "title": "This photo shows Harrison Ford accidentally punching Ryan Gosling in the face on the 'Blade Runner 2049' set", "description": "As \"Blade Runner 2049\" draws critical acclaim, its stars, Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, have been talking about an accidental punch that occurred on its set.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59d39668351ccf89468b6a1e-1136-568.jpg", "creator": "@johnperrylynch", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "This photo shows Harrison Ford accidentally punching Ryan Gosling in the face on the 'Blade Runner 2049' set": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507003200.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
