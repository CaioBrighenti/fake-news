After agreeing to allow Bravo cameras to film her interaction with Bethenny Frankel and her husband Bobby\u2019s funeral, Jill Zarin\u2019s name immediately went to the top of the list.\n\nHousewives head honcho, Andy Cohen, added fuel to the fire when he was asked about a possible return for Zarin at the Tribeca TV Festival\u2019s Tribeca Talks: Ten Years with The Real Housewives of New York City. After comparing being a housewife to being in the mob, Cohen stunned fans be seeming onboard with the idea.\n\n\u201cAnd regarding Jill, I was happy to see she and Bethenny [Frankel] have that moment last season. And, as I said, I was happy it happened in front of a camera, actually, just as a fan of the show and their kind of evolution,\u201d he shared. \u201cBut never say never. I think it would be cool.\u201d\n\nFrankel ended her long-standing friendship with Jill Zarin following Season 3 of the Real Housewives of New York and left the show to start filming a spin-off. During that time Frankel also went on the launch her billion-dollar Skinnygirl company.\n\nZarin has popped up a couple times since she was let go from the cast in 2011.\n\nZarin went to lunch with Dorinda Medley and Luann de Lesseps in Season 9 and Frankel was the hot topic of conversation due to her fight with Ramona Singer at Medley\u2019s home in the Berkshires.\n\nKristen has lunch with Bethenny last week, now she\u2019s with Ramona & Dorinda today. Season 11 vibes?? ?? I would be so here for a KT return! #RHONY pic.twitter.com/5IeYFYEHgT \u2014 Jay (@JaysRealityBlog) October 20, 2018\n\nAfter that episode aired, Zarin admitted that Singer was wrong to have attacked Frankel. She also believes their friendship would have gotten better if Frankel hadn\u2019t quit after Season 3.\n\nJill Zarin has not commented about coming back full-time on the show. But Sonja Morgan and Dorinda Medley both revealed they would love to see her come back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason 11 of the Real Housewives of New York will premiere in the spring of 2019.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jeff-and-Raegan-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Donald-Trump-Jr-and-Aubrey-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chiris-Pratt-Nashville-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jill-Zarin-Returning-To-The-Real-Housewives-Of-New-York-Andy-Cohen-Weighs-In.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kenya-Moore-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Phaedra-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/meghan-markle-2-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Porsha-Williams-pilar-jhena-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Jill-Zarin-Returning-To-The-Real-Housewives-Of-New-York-Andy-Cohen-Weighs-In.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Lynn Gintonio", "Ann Mose", "Gloria Meredith", "Annie Smith"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/jill-zarin-returning-to-the-real-housewives-of-new-york-andy-cohen-weighs-in-204825/", "title": "Jill Zarin Returning To The \u2018Real Housewives Of New York\u2019?
