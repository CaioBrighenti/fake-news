Luckily, people have proved they can be mad about more than one thing. This week, the internet is up in arms over the new Snapchat update. And it seems like everyone \u2014 Kylie Jenner included \u2014 wants the old Snapchat back.\n\nICYMI, the new Snapchat update more clearly separates your friend content from celebrity and media brand content. Meanwhile, it moves stories to the interface that holds your most-snapped friends. This could potentially be a good thing, except for the fact that people hate change. And this is one of the biggest changes to the app since it added media content in the first place. But never fear! Even if your Snapchat auto-updated, there\u2019s a way to fix it. Yes, it\u2019s possible to get rid of the new Snapchat and revert back to the old Snapchat.\n\nHere\u2019s how to get the old Snapchat back: First, you have to delete the app. Just make sure to back up your memories first! Then, change your settings to turn off automatic updates, and re-download the app. When you type in your email, click \u201cForgot Password.\u201d Reset your password \u201cVia Your Phone.\u201d Then log back in, and voil\u00e0, you\u2019re back to the old Snapchat. Phew.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a little irritating to have to do go through those steps. But if you want the old Snapchat you know and love back, and you want it now, that\u2019s what you\u2019ve gotta do.\n\nSome helpful Twitter users are spreading the word.\n\nPSA: how to reverse the Snapchat update \u203c\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/EN2wY3Xo5S \u2014 clare james (@clarejamess9) February 9, 2018\n\nSnapchat itself has also weighed in on the hack.\n\nBefore reinstalling Snapchat or logging out, make sure Memories are backed up or you could lose them \ud83d\ude14\n\n\n\nSettings > Memories > Backup Progress \u2018Complete\u2019 means you\u2019re all set. If not, tap to see which Snaps need backing up.\n\n\n\nYou'll also need your password so you can log back in! \u2014 Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) February 10, 2018\n\nBut with this much public outcry, it\u2019s hard to imagine there won\u2019t be a more permanent fix for the old Snapchat sometime soon. If the app hopes to survive in this social media climate (with Instagram quickly encroaching on its territory), it\u2019s got to pay more attention to its users.\n\nIn fact, change could already be on the horizon.\n\nOne Twitter user reached out to Snapchat directly and got this reply back:\n\nfalse\n\nGuess we\u2019ll have to wait and see how long the teens\u2019 outrage will last \u2014 and if it\u2019ll be long enough to make Snapchat change its mind.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/26115740/quinceneara.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/08/15061655/picture-of-priyanka-chopra-engagement-ring-photo-e1562606368750.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02101219/couple-in-bed-e1562087559934.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27090221/Democratic-Debates-Elizabeth-Warren.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12092117/Friends-Pottery-Barn.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01095134/Natural-Hair.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10114259/us-womens-national-team-e1562784596987.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/11002742/picture-of-old-snapchat-photo.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/04094147/new-tamagotchi-e1559666553874.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28081634/kamala-harris-e1561735008189.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11093957/camile-mendes-lucy-hale-new-e1562863206330.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27144916/police-car-e1561672307647.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/20112858/smartphone-user-e1561055347843.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/03112232/new-jersey-rape-case-e1562178162466.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08101357/a-black-lady-sketch-show-e1562606101435.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11125306/kamala-harris-rape-kits-e1562874800780.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11071143/us-womens-soccer-espys-e1562854315128.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27065900/amy-klobuchar-first-debate-e1561643949698.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072554/avatar-j-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02092501/ama-abortion-laws-e1562084712895.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28115616/dalai-lama-e1561748186500.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09071547/amy-mcgrath-e1562681757171.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/11002742/picture-of-old-snapchat-photo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["P.
