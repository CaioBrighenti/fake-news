Perhaps best known as Chin Ho on CBS\u2019s Hawaii Five-0, Kim, along with co-star Grace Park, left the show after producers controversially refused to give the actors equal pay to their Caucasian co-stars.\n\nBut it seems Kim wasn\u2019t standing still and his principled position left time to concentrate on other projects that allowed for a giant measure of retribution, Hollywood-style. The Korean-American actor, who first rose to stardom in J.J. Abrams\u2019 survivalist drama Lost, had long been fond of the weepy but compelling soap operas that are a staple in his native land. He decided to take a chance and optioned a popular series that debuted in 2013 about an autistic young doctor trying to navigate his way through his first job at a hospital. The plot didn\u2019t seem a likely fit with American network television. Moreover, apart from the long-standing Grey\u2019s Anatomy, hospital dramas since the halo era of George Clooney in ER were no longer in vogue.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhich makes The Good Doctor one of this television season\u2019s most intriguing success stories. It underlines the big-money politics of creating a hit in the era of peak television where perseverance, talent, the burden of race and not a little luck can make or break a show. And the story also has a key Canadian connection in showrunner David Shore, who adapted the series for American audiences. In his first attempt as an executive producer, Kim produced a massive hit right out the gate. Or perhaps more appropriately in the afterglow of the Olympics in Pyeongchang, the rookie scored pure television gold. The show is the most watched drama on network TV. In Canada, it beats out other highly hyped drama juggernauts such as This Is Us. In recent ratings it was the fourth most watched show in Canada after the Academy Awards, Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon. The season finale airs Monday at 10 p.m. on CTV. \u201cAt this point I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d says the soft-spoken Kim, 49, in an interview. \u201cI realize how difficult it is to get any show on the air, let alone one as successful as this one. I\u2019ve been knocking on wood every day.\u201d But Kim says the show really started to develop quickly with the input of London, Ontario\u2019s Shore, who viewers may remember from the last medical series he created, House starring Hugh Laurie as the acerbic Dr. Gregory House.\n\nThe Good Doctor \u201cdidn\u2019t strike me as a Korean show that I could turn into an American show. It struck me as a good universal story,\u201d says Shore, 58, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing that people really tell stories in very similar ways. We are not as different as we think.\u201d \u201cI had never seen a character living with autism on American TV. The humanity of those characters on the Korean show was what I was interested in, not just living with autism,\u201d says Kim. \u201cHe was a three-dimensional human being, not a polemic. And I was lucky to be working with David, who really put everything into focus. When we brought him on board that\u2019s when it became a competitive situation.\u201d\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW", "images": ["https://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/logo-thestar.svg", "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/columnist_logos/Wong_Tony_logo2015.JPG.size.custom.crop.640x360.jpg", "https://images.thestar.com/27YPp6ezkT4MonFTZHXJ9pbKs5g=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/television/2018/03/23/daniel-dae-kim-left-hawaii-five-o-over-a-pay-dispute-he-came-back-to-produce-tvs-biggest-drama-the-good-doctor/daniel_dae_kim_on_the_set_of_the_good_doctor.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images.thestar.com/OG3PyCw6ld6akyXK5a9Gm5t8j-I=/1086x724/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/television/2018/03/23/daniel-dae-kim-left-hawaii-five-o-over-a-pay-dispute-he-came-back-to-produce-tvs-biggest-drama-the-good-doctor/daniel_dae_kim_on_the_set_of_the_good_doctor.jpg", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nuz9l&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nuz9l&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0"], "top_img": "https://images.thestar.com/27YPp6ezkT4MonFTZHXJ9pbKs5g=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/television/2018/03/23/daniel-dae-kim-left-hawaii-five-o-over-a-pay-dispute-he-came-back-to-produce-tvs-biggest-drama-the-good-doctor/daniel_dae_kim_on_the_set_of_the_good_doctor.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Www.Facebook.Com Pages Tony-Wong", "Tony Wong", "Television Critic"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2018/03/23/daniel-dae-kim-left-hawaii-five-o-over-a-pay-dispute-he-came-back-to-produce-tvs-biggest-drama-the-good-doctor.html", "title": "Daniel Dae Kim left Hawaii Five-0 over a pay dispute.
