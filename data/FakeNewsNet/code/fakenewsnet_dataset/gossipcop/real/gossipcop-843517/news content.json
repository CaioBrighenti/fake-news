To honor the star of Riverdale on her birthday, we're taking a moment to revisit Betty Cooper\u2019s best moments on the beloved CW series. Because who would Betty Cooper be without Lili bringing her to life on our televisions and computer screens week after week? (And also because we can hardly wait for Riverdale to come back on October 10. So let's jump into those Betty moments that made us love the character even more.\n\nWhen She Broke Into Ms. Grundy's Car\n\nGIPHY/The CW\n\nThis was our (and Veronica\u2019s) first glimpse at the wonderful and useful sleuthing skills of Miss Betty Cooper and we'll never forget the day. The look of satisfaction she gives V when they hit pay dirt in the car? The world, meet Riverdale\u2019s Nancy Drew. It was also a great reference to a classic Betty character trait from the original comics.\n\nWhen She Kicked Cheryl Out of Her House\n\nGIPHY/The CW\n\nLook, we're definitely in the camp of preferring when Betty and Cheryl team up (see below) to when they\u2019re in frenemy territory. But this was our first taste of Betty\u2019s wrath, and it was pretty deserved at the time TBH (Cheryl was baiting her about Polly), so it has made the list. Don\u2019t mess with Betty, and most importantly, don\u2019t mess with Betty\u2019s family.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9954dff042bc5249ab13f9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/FInding%252520Polly.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9954dabfae5b4a75c0d7c7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/B%252520burning.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9954e7cd23845556428150/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Nana%252520Rose.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d03b9c57d7abacd922129f0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9954dbbeaebd4b79cc9c4f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/BVA%252520at%252520dance.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d0904dbe24476cc5e7f9b95/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Amazon%2520Swimsuits_Story.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9954e2ae6cd84bb0885c17/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Jugs%252520party.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9954decd2384555642814e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Confronting%252520Cheryl.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b99595aba869258d42fe156/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/lede%252520template.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d07b94a9025a77847c9a6f6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede-REAL.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d02a18aabe07369374cf066/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-597571060.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b99597425d82c4483be8029/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/fb-template.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d0b9da9501fc3d29e4c4ae7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Luke%2520Perry_Hero.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d03a6ccb6266f1bf2f3c79f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-ballet.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9954e0ba869258d42fe154/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Grundys%252520car.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d249af91e56d10009927ebe/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9955a0cd23845556428152/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/blackhood.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b9954e10526146039d93c7d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Breaking%252520codes.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d2650c02fdf2e00086c4b6e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-sketchers.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b99597425d82c4483be8029/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/fb-template.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Bianca Nieves", "Marissa Desantis", "Sara Delgado", "Kara Nesvig", "Jessica Macleis", "Tess Garcia", "Lauren Rearick"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/lili-reinhart-best-moments-as-betty-cooper-on-riverdale", "title": "Lili Reinhart's Best 9 Moments as Betty Cooper on Riverdale", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "To celebrate Lili Reinhart's birthday, here are her best 9 moments playing the iconic Betty Cooper on the CW's Riverdale.", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Happy birthday, Lili Reinhart!", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b99597425d82c4483be8029/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/fb-template.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Betty Cooper's Best 9 Moments on &quot;Riverdale&quot;", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/lili-reinhart-best-moments-as-betty-cooper-on-riverdale"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Happy birthday, Lili Reinhart!", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b99597425d82c4483be8029/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/fb-template.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Betty Cooper's Best 9 Moments on &quot;Riverdale&quot;"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311, "admins": 108943}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
