Twenty-two people died and more than 100 were injured in the blast.\n\nUPDATE: One Love Manchester is now completely sold out- and in under 6 minutes! \u2014 One Love Manchester (@1lovemanchester) June 1, 2017\n\nThose who were at the original gig on Monday May 22 have been offered free tickets, while the rest went on sale for $52 (\u00a340).\n\nAll proceeds from the concert, taking place at the Emirates Old Trafford stadium in the city, are going to the Red Cross\u2019s Manchester Emergency Fund. The show is expected to bring in around $2.6 million.\n\nKaty Perry, Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber are joining Grande and Brit-favorites Take That and One Direction\u2019s Niall Horan are also included in the show.
