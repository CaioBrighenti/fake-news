Why have you not promoted it to him?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Because he\u2019s Catholic. He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with it,\u2019 \u201d Remini, 47, says in this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE. \u201cThey let it go after a while, but usually you\u2019d be expected to recruit, especially with somebody you work with for nine years.\u201d\n\nThe church denies Remini\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to do with Kevin James and never attempted to \u2018recruit\u2019 him to the Church,\u201d a Scientology spokesperson wrote in a statement to PEOPLE. \u201cHow does Leah Remini bring this up now after she wrote an entire book and didn\u2019t mention it? Remini does it to get attention. Indeed, the only thing we know about Kevin James is that Remini would repeatedly tell the Church that he was a bully and we tried to counsel her to be more open and communicate so they could get along better. The Church\u2019s full response is at leahreminiaftermath.com.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nIn 2013, Remini abruptly left the controversial religion after more than 30 years. Now, in the new issue of PEOPLE, she\u2019s opening up about how she\u2019s moving on with the help of family and friends \u2014 and why she\u2019s fighting back against the church she claims wants to silence her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finally at peace knowing who I am and who I want to be,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want to be happy \u2014 and I want to help people.\u201d\n\nScientology has come out swinging since she left the church and became one of its most vocal critics. \u201cIt is Remini who is the attacker,\u201d the Scientology spokesperson wrote. \u201cHer whole anti-Scientology shtick was scripted and choreographed by her, casting herself in her drama as the \u2018victim\u2019 so she could cash in on her false narrative while savaging her friends and those who helped her most of her life.\u201d\n\nLast year, the star launched her Emmy-nominated A&E docu-series Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath. Now in its second season, the show follows Remini as she shares fellow ex-Scientologists\u2019s stories, including allegations of abuse within the church.\n\nImage zoom Nino Munoz\n\nRemini says she\u2019s fortunate that when she left Scientology, her husband Angelo Pag\u00e1n, 59, daughter Sofia, 13, and mother Vicki joined her \u2014 because others who leave have had family members and friends who stay within the church and feel forced to \u201cdisconnect\u201d from them. (The church says no one is forced to cut off contact, and disconnection is a choice.)\n\n\u201cThese people who are speaking to me [for the A&E series], they\u2019re getting bullied by Scientology, their children are disconnecting, their parents are disconnecting, and I just hope that I\u2019ve helped even one person to not give up their lives for an ideology,\u201d Remini says.\n\nImage zoom\n\nFor more on Leah Remini\u2019s battle against Scientology, pick up the new issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\nAdds Remini: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to come for me, they\u2019re going to come. I\u2019m not afraid of it. I think it\u2019s disgusting, and the more they do it, the more they expose who they really are \u2026 I would like to be the face of resistance to abuse.\u201d\n\nScientology and the Aftermath isn\u2019t Remini\u2019s only TV project at the moment. Ten years after The King of Queens ended, she will reunite with James on season two of the CBS sitcom Kevin Can Wait, returning Sept. 25.\n\nImage zoom CBS\n\n\u201cI got a call: \u2018Do you want to do some more episodes?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, of course, anything.\u2019 They said, \u2018Okay, so you\u2019re going to be doing all the episodes.\u2019 I was like, \u2018What?! For Kevin, anything,\u2019 \u201d says Remini, who guest-starred on the first season of the comedy and notes James was one of the \u201creal friends\u201d she leaned on when she left Scientology.\n\n\u201cHe reached out to me and said, \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you; if you need anything, I\u2019m here,\u2019 \u201d Remini recalls.\n\nPut your celeb and pop culture knowledge to
