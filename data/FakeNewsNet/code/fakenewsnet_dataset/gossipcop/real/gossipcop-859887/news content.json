I will put my mask on when I am doing those things and then I will jump into the shower to wash it off.\u201d\n\nKerr next uses a rose quartz crystal (she\u2019s a big fan of those) to massage more Noni oil \u2013 made from the Australian native fruit \u2013 into her face.\n\n\u201cI find that my face, especially in the morning, is really puffy so massaging it is really such a good way to stimulate circulation,\u201d she says.\n\nThe former Victoria\u2019s Secret angel\u2019s daily makeup routine is incredibly simple: a little concealer, a little luminiser, some lip balm, a brush of her eyebrows, and sometimes a curl of her eyelashes \u2013 \u201cbut most of the time I have no time\u201d.\n\nInto beauty? Then you might want to listen to Mamamia\u2019s new beauty podcast.\n\nIn the evening, the 35-year-old washes her face with the same 2-in-1 exfoliating mask product she used as a mask that morning, moisturises and then sprays a little lavender mist, with a quick spritz on her pillow as well.\n\nKerr ends the day the way she starts it, with a short transcendental meditation session, which involves her silently repeating a mantra with her eyes closed.\n\n\u201cI do a little meditation as I am falling off to sleep, so I can do that while I am closing my eyes.\u201d\n\nBut before Kerr snuggles into bed with her tech entrepreneur husband Evan Spiegel, she does one thing to her phone. Again, it\u2019s a simple tip we might just copy.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like to have that next to my head. I am too tempted to look at it. [It\u2019s] lights off, Wi-Fi off, phone on airplane mode.\u201d\n\nHow does your skincare routine compare to Miranda Kerr\u2019s?", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=810745638982745&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/a4162fedd85b4949b88ae760c6e127cf/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/03145629/jessica-chambers_blue-150x150.jpg", "https://www.mamamia.com.au/assets/img/6382048.png", "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/11112725/miranda-kerr.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 748 280'%3e%3cpath d='M0 0h748v280H0z' fill='%23fafafb'/%3e%3c/svg%3e", "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mamamia-pwa.appspot.com/o/images%2F512x512_Podcast_You-Beauty_Cover-2019.jpg306?alt=media&token=837a83d3-0e17-4ba9-9c8b-a9cafe0bdd4b", "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/11112717/miranda-kerr-skincare.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/11112717/miranda-kerr-skincare.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mamamia.com.au/miranda-kerr-skincare-vogue/", "title": "Miranda Kerr shares a detailed account of her morning-to-night beauty routine.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "theme-color": "#3b3b3e", "description": "Miranda Kerr skincare routine involves crystals, meditation and a whole lot of natural products.
