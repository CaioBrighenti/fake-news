Rachel Bilson purchased a $3.25 million mansion in the affluent Linda Vista neighborhood of Pasadena, California, after her split from Hayden Christensen.\n\nCelebrity Splits of 2017\n\nThe six-bedroom, four-bathroom home, known as \u201cRalph\u2019s House,\u201d was built in 1950 and designed by Gregory Ain, according to Trulia. The single-level property measures 3678-square-feet and features floor-to-ceiling windows for natural light and refurbished wood floors. The spacious living room has a cozy fireplace, built-in bookshelves and paneled walls that conceal a stereo system and wet bar.\n\nThe galley kitchen has also been renovated with new appliances and improvements to the original cabinetry. A sliding glass door leads outside to a stunning backyard that boasts rolling gardens, an open-air courtyard, a swimming pool, a dry rock stream and a deck that overlooks the city\u2019s nearby canyons and mountaintops.\n\nBilson and Christensen, both 36, previously lived in a four-bedroom and four-and-a-half-bathroom home in Sherman Oaks, California.\n\nUs Weekly exclusively confirmed in September that the O.C. alum and the Star Wars actor, who share 2-year-old daughter Briar Rose, called it quits after nearly 10 years together. \u201cShe\u2019s full time back in L.A. He\u2019s in Toronto,\u201d a source told Us. \u201cThey\u2019ve been on the outs for a couple of months. They are completely, officially done.\u201d\n\nPrior to the split, Bilson opened up about the notion of having a second baby with Christensen. \u201cI may have another child, that\u2019s still up in the air,\u201d she told Lapalme magazine. \u201cI\u2019m having so much fun with the one right now. I want to be happy and content. All the life B.S. that happens doesn\u2019t matter.
