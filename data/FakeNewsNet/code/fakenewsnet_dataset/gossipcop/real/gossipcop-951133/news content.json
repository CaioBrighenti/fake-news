Crystal recounted the conversation in which Robin revealed the devastating news to him. \u201cHis number comes up on my phone,\u201d he said, \u201cand he says, \u2018Hey, Bill.\u2019 His voice was high-pitched. \u2018I\u2019ve just been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s.\u2019 I didn\u2019t miss a beat. Because of my relationship with Muhammad Ali, I knew a lot of really good Parkinson\u2019s research doctors. I said, \u2018In Phoenix, the research center is great. If you want, we can get you in there. It would be totally anonymous. Do you want me to pursue that?\u2019 \u2018Would you?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard him afraid like that before,\u201d Crystal said. \u201cThis was the boldest comedian I ever met\u2014the boldest artist I ever met. But this was just a scared man.\u201d\n\nAmong his associates who knew, there was unease: they were worried, of course, about Robin\u2019s well-being, but also concerned about whether he was in a position to receive the assistance he needed. \u201cI don\u2019t think the people around him knew how to handle it and how to help him,\u201d Cyndi McHale said. \u201cLook, it\u2019s the perfect storm. He had a physical condition that was manifesting. He knew there was something wrong with his brain. And two of his best friends\u2014my late husband and Christopher Reeve\u2014ended up paralyzed in a wheelchair. So he\u2019s thinking, O.K., I\u2019m losing control of my body. There\u2019s something going on in my brain. I think he was just trapped.\u201d\n\nRobin\u2019s children felt that it was now more important than ever to share time with their father. But doing so meant navigating past layer after layer of other people who also had access to him and wanted his attention\u2014Susan; his assistant, Rebecca; his managers\u2014and even this much resistance could discourage them from seeking him out.\n\nWhen Robin did have time to get together with him, Zak could tell that his father was in anguish, and not only from the strain of his condition. \u201cIt was really difficult to see someone suffering so silently,\u201d Zak said. \u201cBut I think that there were a series of things that stacked, that led to an environment that he felt was one of pain, internal anguish, and one that he couldn\u2019t get out of. And the challenge in engaging with him when he was in that mind-set was that he could be soothed, but it\u2019s really hard when you then go back into an environment of isolation. Isolation is not good for Dad and people like him. It\u2019s actually terrible.\u201d\n\nRobin\u2019s children had always been a dependable source of some of the purest, most natural joy he had experienced. But when he saw them now, they were also a reminder that he had chosen to end his marriage to Marsha and break up their home; it filled him with shame to think that he had inflicted the divorce upon them, and the shame compounded itself as he came to believe he had taken something perfect and corrupted it.\n\nEven when his children told him that he had no reason to hold on to his guilt and nothing to apologize for, Zak said, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t hear it. He could never hear it. And he wasn\u2019t able to accept it. He was firm in his conviction that he was letting us down. And that was sad because we all loved him so much and just wanted him to be happy.\u201d\n\nAt home, Susan saw Robin\u2019s condition continue to worsen. When they tried to sleep at night, Robin would thrash around the bed, or more often he would be awake and wanting to talk about whatever new delusion his mind had conjured up. Robin tried many treatments to regain the upper hand over the disease: he continued to see a therapist, work out with a physical trainer, and ride his bike; he even found a specialist at Stanford University who taught him self-hypnosis. But each of these strategies could only do so much. In the meantime, Robin started sleeping in a separate bedroom from Susan.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/53ea73fa9b1e228549e7afee/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/robin-williams-hook.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af19082c3caac4f50cdacfe/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/embed03-Robin-Williams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d28eddf2c2137000877b8af/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/stranger-things-ratings.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af19082b729797c29525f2b/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/tout-and-lede-Robin-Williams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5783d1803acd1f4426d7aa49/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/robin-williams-arthur-grace-photos-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d03a3b276711f0f057fe6b1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/euphoria-review-hbo.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a971818adad664a16b0fc93/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/oscars-1998-review.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ae312f8417d2e416ae8b8ff/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-951607578.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af19082310ffe7fb0da4bd8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/embed01-Robin-Williams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5783d1803d5bd24b0c64e04e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/robin-williams-arthur-grace-photos-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af19082b729797c29525f2b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-and-lede-Robin-Williams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5783d1833acd1f4426d7aa4c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/robin-williams-arthur-grace-photos-ss07.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af190826f0e8f6dd419812a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/embed02-Robin-Williams.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af19082b729797c29525f2b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-and-lede-Robin-Williams.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Yohana Desta", "Richard Lawson", "Vanity Fair", "Sonia Saraiya", "Dave Itzkof", "Kevin Fitzpatrick"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/robin-williams-death-biography-dave-itzkoff-excerpt", "title": "Inside the Final Days of Robin Williams", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "New York Times reporter Dave Itzkoff details the beloved star\u2019s heartbreaking decline in this exclusive excerpt from Robin, his new biography.", "keywords": "robin williams,books,book,excerpt,excerpts", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "New York Times reporter Dave Itzkoff details the beloved star\u2019s heartbreaking decline in this exclusive excerpt from Robin, his new biography.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af19082b729797c29525f2b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-and-lede-Robin-Williams.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Inside the Final Days of Robin Williams", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/robin-williams-death-biography-dave-itzkoff-excerpt"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "New York Times reporter Dave Itzkoff details the beloved star\u2019s heartbreaking decline in this exclusive excerpt from Robin, his new biography.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af19082b729797c29525f2b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-and-lede-Robin-Williams.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Inside the Final Days of Robin Williams"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
