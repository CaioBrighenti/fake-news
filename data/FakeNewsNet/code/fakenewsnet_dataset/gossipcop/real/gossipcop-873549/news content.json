This post won\u2019t contain many spoilers for their interaction; instead, it dives into a fairly compelling theory that book readers have been working on for decades. But just in case you\u2019d prefer not to read all about it until after you\u2019ve watched Season 7, Episode 3, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Justice,\u201d now is your time to duck out.\n\nFirst of all, it should shock no one watching Game of Thrones that at some point in the series, the two most telegenic and destiny-laden characters on the series would meet up. Readers have long suspected that George R.R. Martin\u2019s series title, A Song of Ice and Fire, is a reference to the pre-destined adventures of Jon (Ice) and Daenerys (Fire). But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here to talk about.\n\nWe\u2019re also not here to talk about the deeply held suspicion that these two characters will become romantically involved. Even if the rules of dramatic storytelling didn\u2019t automatically destine two young, compelling, eligible people for a love match, Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington have been fanning the flames in a series of promotional photo shoots, from a 2012 Rolling Stone photoshoot for Season 2 to one, in costume, for Entertainment Weekly in 2013. They were even smooching in an outtake from that Rolling Stone photoshoot held from the magazine (I wonder why!), but released on the photographer\u2019s Instagram in 2016.\n\nKhal who? Ygritte huh? Exactly. The pair might not have gotten along like a sept on fire when they finally met in Episode 3, but still, there was chemistry in the Dragonstone throne room. But an incestuous love match between aunt Daenerys and her nephew, Jon, would hardly rate as \u201csurprising\u201d\u2014so what, exactly, do Game of Thrones book readers think they know?\n\nAs with most of the best Thrones theories, this one comes to us via the dreams and prophecies that take up large sections of the books, but which the HBO series has largely had to cut. One of the most intriguing recurring symbols that crops up again and again is the blue winter rose. In the books, Ned remembers \u201cthe moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty\u2019s laurel in Lyanna\u2019s lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost.\u201d Lyanna is, as was revealed last season, Jon\u2019s mother and Ned\u2019s sister. In the show, it\u2019s Littlefinger who tells this story to Sansa in Season 5. Yes, he includes the roses.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57681c203a8e2de6469421f8/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/jon-snow-emilia-clarke.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/597e84c7f3c6f80e768c7fb3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/dany-north-wall.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d0263d9ef4f5d344a3a40b2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-lead-jon-stewart.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ce2278faa8a176cc69e3f3f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/gc-starks.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d03acff76711f312e7fe6b3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Jeffrey-Katzenberg%25E2%2580%2599s-Quibi.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d0fa6ccb1f2b43a190cf84d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/game-of-thrones-direwolves.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a381fc6ceb0b25b3145a85/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-7-7.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d0673441af02c7f4269ff67/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/game-of-thrones-lena-headey-better-death.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5951cfa071024b76a8c138ce/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/dany-jon.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a38200cfd9802e965f4c13/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-7-8.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5342cc895502796f770003c8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/symbolism1.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d0a309806eff155285fb44a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/game-of-thrones-cersei-deleted-scene-miscarriage-pregnancy.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d03a3b276711f0f057fe6b1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/euphoria-review-hbo.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d07ab9bfaddf22be7a3f661/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/downton-abby-posters-lede.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57681c203a8e2de6469421f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jon-snow-emilia-clarke.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a381f3bab3e1306a96a92f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-7-1.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/595d5b9d96475a07efe9926f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/got-spoiler-dragon.gif"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57681c203a8e2de6469421f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jon-snow-emilia-clarke.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Laura Bradley", "Yohana Desta", "Kevin Fitzpatrick", "Joanna Robinso", "Sonia Saraiya", "Nicole Sperling"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-3-recap-queens-justice-jon-daenerys-fall-in-love", "title": "This Hidden Game of Thrones Symbolism Hints at a Surprising Destiny for Jon and Daenerys", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "What do you make of the show\u2019s newest pair?", "keywords": "jon snow,daenerys targaryen,lyanna,ned,the blue rise", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "What do you make of the show\u2019s newest pair?", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57681c203a8e2de6469421f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jon-snow-emilia-clarke.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "This Hidden Game of Thrones Symbolism Hints at a Surprising Destiny for Jon and Daenerys", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-3-recap-queens-justice-jon-daenerys-fall-in-love"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "What do you make of the show\u2019s newest pair?", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57681c203a8e2de6469421f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jon-snow-emilia-clarke.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "This Hidden Game of Thrones Symbolism Hints at a Surprising Destiny for Jon and Daenerys"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
