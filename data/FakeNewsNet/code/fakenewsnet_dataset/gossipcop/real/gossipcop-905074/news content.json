She doesn\u2019t know yet,\u201d another source said. \u201cBut anyway this plays out, this is a long game.\u201d\n\nREAD: Was Oprah\u2019s \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d Speech A Prelude To A Presidential Run?\n\nIf you think that Trump\u2019s candidacy disrupted the GOP primary process, you can only imagine the sheer pandemonium that would go on in the Democratic party if Oprah decided to challenge Trump for the highest office in the land. Winfrey, a recent Cecil B. Demille award recipient at the 2018 Golden Globes, has not inferred that she\u2019s in or even interested publicly, but she\u2019s not ruling it out either.\n\nHer camp has declined to comment.\n\nIt is with all that that makes King\u2019s comments so impactful. She praised her BFF on CBS This Morning for delivering a \u201chome run\u201d speech, but said it was not intended as a \u201claunching pad\u201d for a presidential campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t think at this point she is actually considering it,\u201d Gayle said, before also saying, \u201cI also know, after years of watching \u2018The Oprah Show,\u2019 you always have the right to change your mind.\u201d\n\nWith Winfrey\u2019s friends urging her to run and even offering to help, Gayle has interestingly enough jumpstarted an invisible sort of primary process. Other potential Democratic candidates are heading to Iowa to jostle for position even though the first primaries are two years away. \u201cIf she runs, she will destroy anybody in front of her. The question is, does she want to do it?\u201d CNN political commentator Van Jones said on AC360 Monday night. \u201cThere\u2019s basically bedlam in Oprah-land right now, as people are begging her, \u2018Please run, please run, please run.\u2019 She\u2019s given no indication that she has moved off her position that she doesn\u2019t want to do it.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Oprah Winfrey Steal The Show During Her \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d Golden Globes Speech\n\nThe question of will she or won\u2019t she run is triggering hours of news coverage. The New York Post cover reads \u201cNOPRAH!\u201d while the Daily News says \u201cYES SHE CAN!\u201d Will she want to endure the mudslinging negative attack ads and insults that Donald Trump would surely throw her way? Are we ready to accept a populist nature that those who are on our television screens are going to dictate policy in our country? \u201cI hate to spoil everybody\u2019s fun, but I don\u2019t believe for a minute that Oprah Winfrey will run for president,\u201d Chicago media columnist Robert Feder wrote on Monday.\n\nWith more questions than answers, King has left the door open for speculation to continue, saying, \u201cI\u2019m thinking that she is not going to be running for president. That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, [but] I do think she\u2019s very intrigued.\u201d\n\nSource: CNN Money", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bcknOTN_Y03wc.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2028207464136367&ev=PageView\n\t\t&noscript=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-L7GUus8KYDr8V.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17938494&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/427558e8ab6e58dca7fe79a88d20563c?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rs_1024x759-180107193425-1024-orpah-winfrey-golden-globe-winner-e1515420063818.jpg", "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Oprah-Winfrey-To-Join-60-Minutes-As-Special-Contributor.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rs_1024x759-180107193425-1024-orpah-winfrey-golden-globe-winner-e1515420063818.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.okayplayer.com/culture/oprahs-bff-gayle-king-says-presidential-run-2020-intriguing.html", "title": "Oprah\u2019s BFF Gayle King Says Presidential Run In 2020 Is \u201cIntriguing\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width = device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Oprah\u2019s BFF Gayle King Says Presidential Run In 2020 Is \u201cIntriguing\u201d", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff4200", "description": "According to Oprah Winfrey\u2019s best friend, Gayle King, she is \u201cintrigued by the idea\u201d of running for the highest office in the land in 2020.", "fb": {"pages": 7641733766}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Oprah\u2019s BFF Gayle King Says Presidential Run In 2020 Is \u201cIntriguing\u201d", "description": "According to Oprah Winfrey\u2019s best friend, Gayle King, she is \u201cintrigued by the idea\u201d of running for the highest office in the land in 2020.", "url": "https://www.okayplayer.com/culture/oprahs-bff-gayle-king-says-presidential-run-2020-intriguing.html", "site_name": "Okayplayer", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rs_1024x759-180107193425-1024-orpah-winfrey-golden-globe-winner-e1515420063818.jpg", "width": 715, "height": 530}}, "article": {"tag": "Oprah Winfrey", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2018-01-09T10:37:05-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "According to Oprah Winfrey\u2019s best friend, Gayle King, she is \u201cintrigued by the idea\u201d of running for the highest office in the land in 2020.", "title": "Oprah\u2019s BFF Gayle King Says Presidential Run In 2020 Is \u201cIntriguing\u201d", "site": "@okayplayer", "image": "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rs_1024x759-180107193425-1024-orpah-winfrey-golden-globe-winner-e1515420063818.jpg", "creator": "@okayplayer"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-favicon-300x300.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515508625.0, "source": "https://www.okayplayer.com", "summary": ""}
