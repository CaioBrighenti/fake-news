In April 2017, both men were indicted on additional charges including tax evasion, structuring and falsifying records.\n\nIn January, Sorrentino pled guilty to one count of tax evasion and was sentenced to eight months in prison on Oct. 5. (His brother Marc pled guilty to one count of aiding in the preparation of a false and fraudulent tax return and was sentenced to two years in prison.)\n\nOf the Jan. 15 surrender date, a rep for Sorrentino told PEOPLE that the reality star is \u201cgrateful to continue work, celebrate the holidays and his three years sober milestone\u201d before beginning his sentence.\n\n\u201cHe looks forward to completing his sentence and coming home to Lauren, family and friends,\u201d the rep added.\n\nRELATED: Jersey Shore\u2018s Mike \u2018The Situation\u2019 Sorrentino\u2019s Wedding Registry Includes a Hamper for GTL\n\nSorrentino and Pesce met in math class in community college.\n\n\u201cWe went out together for about four years, and then once Jersey Shore started we decided to take a break throughout seasons 1-6,\u201d he told PEOPLE earlier this year. \u201cOnce [the show] was over, we eventually reconnected and have been together ever since, for over four years now.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend, my better half,\u201d he added. \u201cShe makes me a better person.
