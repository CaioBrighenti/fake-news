Lithgow has now won a total of six Emmys, including several for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in the late 1990s in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and another Emmy in 2010 for a role in Dexter. The win gives Netflix, which earned 92 Emmy nominations this year, a quick start to the evening.\n\nLithgow beat out other nominees, including Jeffrey Wright in Westworld and Michael Kelly in House of Cards, but acknowledged the actors in his acceptance speech. \u201cI feel so lucky to have won this in the company of my fellow nominees. Some of you are my friends and former cast-mates,\u201d Lithgow said, adding that \u201cThe Crown just keeps on giving, and this is just the last of its gifts.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yLur24RdB1OwiM6H6nB5pjcIw2o=/0x0:2128x3000/1200x800/filters:focal(1364x802:1704x1142)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56722883/848629970.0.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZd-KvTelx-UV5M_hvPJ-mjyFCg=/0x415:2128x1529/fit-in/1200x630/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268353/848629970.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZd-KvTelx-UV5M_hvPJ-mjyFCg=/0x415:2128x1529/fit-in/1200x630/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268353/848629970.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sep"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/17/16323768/john-lithgow-emmys-2017-supporting-actor-drama-series-winner", "title": "John Lithgow wins the Emmy for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/verge", "published_time": "2017-09-17T20:40:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-17T20:40:19-04:00"}, "author": "Shannon Liao", "style-tools": "https://www.theverge.com/style/community/372/6e15e9dd268c6af56a800c222c57d3d2/tools.css", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Netflix gets started early", "og": {"description": "Netflix gets started early", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZd-KvTelx-UV5M_hvPJ-mjyFCg=/0x415:2128x1529/fit-in/1200x630/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268353/848629970.jpg", "alt": "69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards - Show", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "The Verge", "title": "John Lithgow wins the Emmy for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/17/16323768/john-lithgow-emmys-2017-supporting-actor-drama-series-winner"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/17/16323768/john-lithgow-emmys-2017-supporting-actor-drama-series-winner", "title": "John Lithgow wins the Emmy for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series", "description": "Netflix gets started early", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HZd-KvTelx-UV5M_hvPJ-mjyFCg=/0x415:2128x1529/fit-in/1200x630/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268353/848629970.jpg", "alt": "69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards - Show"}, "site": "verge"}, "sailthru.title": "John Lithgow wins the Emmy for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series", "sailthru.tags": "general,the-verge,front-page,entertainment,tv,emmys,culture", "sailthru.description": "Netflix gets started early", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-17 20:40:19", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Dy-sAYq_uVOv95-A5Zpbd1G4ts=/0x374:2128x1571/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56722881/848629970.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NI8Nq0nLjNSHO8krUJrCoNcaGxg=/0x0:2128x2128/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56722881/848629970.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7396113/221a67c8-a10f-11e6-8fae-983107008690.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#393092", "outbrainsection": "culture"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505620800.0, "source": "https://www.theverge.com", "summary": ""}
