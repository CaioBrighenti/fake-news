She stood up to her monster rapist and now she has to stand up to yet another monster, suicide. The suicide of her beloved lover and ally, Anthony Bourdain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI write these truths because I have been asked to. I know so many around the world thought of Anthony Bourdain as a friend and when a friend dies, it hurts. Many of these people who lost their \u2018friend\u2019 are wanting to lash out and blame. You must not sink to that level. Suicide is a horrible choice, but it is that person\u2019s choice,\u201d she added.\n\nImage zoom Anthony Bourdain and Asia Argento John Nacion/Startraks\n\nRELATED: Rose McGowan Mourns the Loss of Friend Anthony Bourdain in Teary Video: \u2018I\u2019m So Mad at You\u2019\n\nBourdain began dating the Italian actress in 2017, after she appeared on an episode of Parts Unknown filmed in her hometown of Rome. She recently directed an upcoming episode set in Hong Kong, and Bourdain would often consult her for her rich knowledge of music and film when putting together the series.\n\nArgento was one of the dozens of women to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment in 2017 (Weinstein has \u201cunequivocally\u201d denied \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex\u201d). Bourdain became one of the most outspoken celebrities about the #MeToo era, showing unwavering support for his girlfriend, and even holding a dinner for Argento and fellow Weinstein accusers McGowan and Annabella Sciorra.\n\nAddressing the late chef\u2019s depression, McGowan continued, \u201cAnthony was open with his demons, he even wrote a book about them. In the beginning of their relationship, Anthony told a mutual friend, \u2018He\u2019s never met anyone who wanted to die more than him.\u2019 And through a lot of this last year, Asia did want the pain to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut here\u2019s the thing, over their time together, thankfully, she did the work to get help, so she could stay alive and live another day for her and her children. Anthony\u2019s depression didn\u2019t let him, he put down his armor, and that was very much his choice. His decision, not hers. His depression won,\u201d she remarked.\n\nImage zoom Anthony Bourdain and Asia Argento\n\nRELATED: Asia Argento Shared Cryptic Message Hours Before Anthony Bourdain\u2019s Apparent Suicide\n\nOpening up about the pair\u2019s \u201cfree relationship,\u201d McGowan wrote that \u201cwhen Anthony met Asia, it was instant chemistry. They laughed, they loved and he was her rock during the hardships of this last year.\u201d\n\nContinuing, she wrote that the pair \u201cloved without borders of traditional relationships, and they established the parameters of their relationship early on. Asia is a free bird, and so was Anthony. Was. Such a terrible word to write. I\u2019ve heard from many that the past two years they were together were some of his happiest and that should give us all solace.\u201d\n\nWhile Bourdain was shooting for Parts Unknown in France before his death, Argento was spotted holding hands with another man in Rome, according to TMZ.\n\nImage zoom Anthony Bourdain and Asia Argento Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cAnthony was 61, the same age my father was when he died. My father also suffered from intermittent deep depression, and like Anthony, was part of a \u2018pull up your bootstraps and march on\u2019 generation. The a \u2018strong man doesn\u2019t ask for help\u2019 generation,\u201d she wrote, adding that although Bourdain did reach out for help before taking his life, \u201che did not take the doctor\u2019s advice.\u201d\n\nShe also asked fans of the late chef and TV host to \u201cNOT do the sexist thing and burn a woman on the pyre of misplaced blame.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnthony\u2019s internal war was his war, but now she\u2019s been left on the battlefield to take the bullets. It is in no way fair or acceptable to blame her or anyone else, not even Anthony. We are asking you to be better, to look deeper, to read and learn about mental illness, suicide and depression before you make it worse for survivors by judging that which we do not understand, that which can never fully be understood. Sometimes we are stuck in the unknowable, and that is where we are now, a massive wave of darkness that threatens to swallow everyone in its wake,\u201d she added.\n\nImage zoom Rose McGowan and. Anthony Bourdain Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock; Slaven Vlasic/Getty\n\nThe 44-year-old actress went on to implore anybody reading her open letter to \u201cjoin me in sending healing energy to Anthony on his journey, and to all who\u2019ve been left behind to journey on without him. There is no one to blame but the stigma of loneliness, the stigma of asking for help, the stigma of mental illness, the stigma of being famous and hurting,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe also added that \u201cAnthony would never have wanted Asia to be hurt,\u201d before urging anyone who might be considering suicide to seek help. \u201cWe need you here. You matter. You exist. You count. There is help a phone call away, reach out,\u201d she added.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Chefs like Anthony Bourdain Face Constant \u2018Behind-the-Scenes\u2019 Anxieties: \u2018When The Shift Stops What Do You Do?\u2019\n\nOn Friday, Bourdain was found unresponsive in his hotel room in Kaysersberg, France, by his close friend Eric Ripert, according to CNN. Both were filming an upcoming episode of Parts Unknown.\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE, French prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny previously said there was no evidence of violence in Bourdain\u2019s death.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times hours after the news of Bourdain\u2019s death, his mother Gladys Bourdain said she had no indication that her son may have been thinking about suicide. However, following his death, she spoke to Ripert who told her that \u201cTony had been in a dark mood these past couple of days.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please
