Gaining your \"Angel wings\" \u2014 intricately designed pairs of wings given to the most highly regarded models in the show \u2014 is a whole other privilege.\n\nJan Planit, who used to head up top modeling agency IMG and now runs Planit Model Management, once told the New York Post: \"There are very few special things you can achieve as a model. Getting your Angel wings is the ultimate.\"\n\nThe iconic shows are famed for their dramatic, colorful, and skimpy outfits, as well as their impressive lineup of entertainment. This year's musical guests include Harry Styles, Miguel, and Leslie Odom Jr.\n\nLast year, 51 top models made the final cut for the show, just 14 of whom were designated \"Victoria's Secret Angels\"\u2014 brand ambassadors who travel the world promoting Victoria's Secret year-round. Best friends Gigi Hadid and Kendall Jenner became the most recent models to earn their wings on stage at the 2016 show.\n\nWhile being in the show or getting wings are honors in themselves, the money doesn't hurt either. Nine of the models who appeared in the 2016 show appeared on Forbes' list of the world's 20 highest-paid models in 2016.\n\nScroll down to see the highest-paid Victoria's Secret models from last year's show, ranking in ascending order by their 2016 earnings, according to Forbes.\n\n*The earnings are an estimate based on income from all modeling contracts, both from Victoria Secret as well as other companies.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a157b663dbef41d008b7a99-750-500.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a157e84f914c355018b58bd-1920-960.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a157e84f914c355018b58bd-1920-960.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rosie Fitzmaurice", "Amanda Luz Henning Santiago"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-victorias-secret-models-2017-11", "title": "These are the 9 highest-paid Victoria's Secret models", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-11-22", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-22", "news_keywords": "Victoria's Secret, Rosie Fitzmaurice, Amanda Luz Henning Santiago", "sailthru.tags": "Victoria's Secret, Rosie Fitzmaurice, Amanda Luz Henning Santiago", "description": "Nine of the models in the most recent Victoria's Secret Fashion Show were among the 20 highest-paid models in the world in 2016.", "sailthru.description": "Nine of the models in the most recent Victoria's Secret Fashion Show were among the 20 highest-paid models in the world in 2016.", "title": "These are the 9 highest-paid Victoria's Secret models", "sailthru.verticals": "none", "sailthru.title": "These are the 9 highest-paid Victoria's Secret models", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a157e84f914c355018b58bd-1920-960.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a157e15f914c353018b58a1-1136-852.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a157e15f914c353018b58a1-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Business Insider", "sailthru.author": "Amanda Luz Henning Santiago", "og": {"title": "These are the 9 highest-paid Victoria's Secret models", "description": "Nine of the models in the most recent Victoria's Secret Fashion Show were among the 20 highest-paid models in the world in 2016.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-victorias-secret-models-2017-11", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a157e84f914c355018b58bd-1920-960.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Rosie Fitzmaurice, Amanda Luz Henning Santiago", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-victorias-secret-models-2017-11", "title": "These are the 9 highest-paid Victoria's Secret models", "description": "Nine of the models in the most recent Victoria's Secret Fashion Show were among the 20 highest-paid models in the world in 2016.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a157e84f914c355018b58bd-1920-960.jpg", "creator": "@RosieFitzmauric", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "These are the 9 highest-paid Victoria's Secret models": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511326800.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
