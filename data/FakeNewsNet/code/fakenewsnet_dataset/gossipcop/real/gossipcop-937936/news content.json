Meghan and Harry joined Prince Edward and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex in the carriage.\n\nAs their carriage entered the parade ring behind the main grandstand, racegoers were able to get a closer look at Meghan, 36, who wore an elegant white ensemble by Givenchy (her wedding dress designer!) with a matching white hat with black detailing by Philip Treacy.\n\nImage zoom Meghan Markle SplashNews.com\n\nHarry, 33, looked dapper in his traditional tailcoat and top hat. He was seen in the same formal suit for the wedding of his cousin Celia McCorquodale on Saturday.\n\nImage zoom Prince Harry, Prince Edward, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex SplashNews.com\n\nImage zoom Prince Harry, Sophie, Countess of Wessex and Meghan Markle SplashNews.com\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

Charles laughed heartily with his new daughter-in-law, before they joined the Queen in the royal box just in time to watch the first race.\n\nImage zoom PA Images/Sipa USA\n\nMeghan and Harry capped their first appearance together at Royal Ascot by handing out the trophy for the St. James\u2019s Palace Stakes to the winner \u2014 one of Britain\u2019s most popular jockeys, Frankie Dettori.\n\nImage zoom Kirstin Sinclair/Getty\n\nImage zoom DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty\n\nImage zoom Kirstin Sinclair/Getty\n\nSeveral members of the royal family gathered in the Parade Ring to watch the last race, which featured one of the Queen\u2019s horses, Fabricate. But the horse failed to make any of top positions in the Wolferton Stakes.\n\nIt\u2019s believed to be the first time that Meghan has been to the famous races, and it comes a day after her father appeared on British TV talking about his regret at not being at the royal wedding and his hopes for his daughter starting a family.\n\nImage zoom Queen Elizabeth at Royal Ascot Chris Jackson/Getty
