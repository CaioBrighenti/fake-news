Judging by Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s hilarious brush with terror on Friday\u2019s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the answer is a grown adult wearing a cheap Iron Man costume.\n\nNotorious for scaring celebrity guests on her long-running talk series, DeGeneres set her sights on the Avengers: Infinity War star for her latest gag.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done just about everything. You have not done a horror film, right? Do you want to do a horror film?\u201d she asks her guest. He responds: \u201cKind of. Well, as in, somebody was saying to me, \u2018What haven\u2019t you done that you\u2019d like to do,\u2019 and I guess I\u2019d like to do a horror or a musical. Maybe both. Maybe a horrifying musical. It might be if I sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you, in general, like to go to scary movies?\u201d DeGeneres continues. \u201cI scare very easy, and I have a rampant imagination\u2026 [but] you know it\u2019s like, okay, that\u2019s fake blood. Although I\u2019m still very susceptible.\u201d\n\nA member of DeGeneres\u2019 staff (clad in Iron Man gear) then jumps out from the table between the pair, scaring the hell out of Cumberbatch.\n\n\u201cOh, f\u2014 off!\u201d Cumberbatch screams. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop doing that. It\u2019s getting tired, but clearly not on me\u2026 I should know that happens on this show!\u201d\n\nThe Ellen DeGeneres Show airs weekdays.
