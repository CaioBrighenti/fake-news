The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills pal has started volunteering at Skydog Ranch, a nonprofit organization that provides a forever home to wild mustangs that have found themselves at kill pens, at auctions, or abusive and neglectful homes. Skydog Ranch provides volunteer opportunities to people in recovery.\n\nKim recently told E! News that working at Skydog Ranch has helped with the recovery process over the past year-and-a-half. \"My recovery has been amazing and I love how I feel. This has been a huge part of it and has helped me a lot,\" she explained. \"The Sanctuary keeps me grounded and keeps me at peace and it's healthy for me. It's been amazing for me and me coming here has really been a major part of keeping me sober.\"\n\nThe RHOBH sister shared that her work at the Sanctuary has helped her get back what she's lost about herself. \"I do, you can't not find yourself here with the horses and the animals. There is something about it and it gives me self-confidence and self-worth because sometimes people lose themselves and coming here gives me that self-confidence and self-worth that for a long time I thought I lost,\" she said in regards to whether she feels like she's found herself. \"Going through sobriety and being a part of this gives you back a huge piece of who you are. I've been given back that piece and I am Kim now. It feels amazing.\"\n\nIn addition to her work at Skydog Ranch, Kim credited her loved ones, especially her grandson Hucksley, who turns 1 later this month, with helping her maintain her sobriety. \"And also I have four amazing kids and having my grandson come into my life this last year has changed [my] world. He has lit up my life. My kids \u2014 I still enjoy being a mother as much as I did the day they were born. I still have so much fun with my kids,\" Kim gushed to E! News. \"And for me to have this amazing life here with these horses, I feel complete. I really do. I have amazing friends, I have these amazing kids and their significant others and my grandson. I know that God has more out there for me but my life is so good today. It really is, I just want to share that last part about how I feel \u2014 life is good today. Between my children, my friends, my grandson, my life here, I just feel very blessed and very grateful.\"\n\nSee more of Kim and her beautiful family, below.", "images":
