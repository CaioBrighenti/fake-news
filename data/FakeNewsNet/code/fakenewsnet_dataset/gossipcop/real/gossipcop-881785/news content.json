Not all of them, but many at the end of the day, they believe in one thing: Themselves and nothing else or no one else.\n\n\n\nYears ago, Hollywood jumped on the Joseph Campbell bandwagon, especially screenwriters, because Campbell mentioned Star Wars and the cottage industry screenwriting gurus incorporated \"Hero's Journey...\" blah, blah, blah and other Joe Campbell lingo into all of their teachings. Robert Mitchum's quote applies.\n\n\n\nThank God! I discovered Joseph Campbell before I truly discovered Hollywood.\n\n\n\nKen Baker weaves an interesting spiritual quest for answers, antithetic to Bill Maher.\n\nHis catalyst, which is relatable to most of us, is losing his religion in a hedonistic place like Tinseltown. NBA player Lamar Odom's road to excess is the jumping off point, or \"leap of faith\" that Ken must perform a deep high-dive into his soul. He goes on to tell a stereotypical Catholic upbringing where the family of five attends church and the father goes through the motions to placate the mother, but never honestly embraces God...\n\nAn amazing spiritual story evolves from this tragedy.\n\n\n\nKen Baker's an excellent writer and entertaining to read. I burned through his book and enjoyed the spiritual quest alongside him as a reader. As a senior correspondent for E! his job \"is to report on the gamut of entertainment news...\", \" ...as well as the daily hookups, breakups, and screw-ups of the world's biggest stars.\" Who better qualified? I ask. You will actually learn something from Ken's book, and it might even contradict what you think about some of the celebrities he interviewed. If you've seen\n\nThomas Peter \"Tom\" Shadyac's \"I Am\" documentary or most recently Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, then one could view Hollywood as a spiritual sinkhole.\n\n\n\nKey takeaway is: Don't discover God on your deathbed. If you chose not to have faith, or find religion a fairly tale, Hey, \"whatever gets you through the night,\" as John Lennon once wrote. Maybe God is George Burns to some people in Hollywood. However, for me, I am personally comfortable with Camus' logic that:\n\n\n\n\"I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is.\"", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/757a029f-452b-417d-b647-07f8763f9635._CR0,0,400,400_SX48_.jpg",
