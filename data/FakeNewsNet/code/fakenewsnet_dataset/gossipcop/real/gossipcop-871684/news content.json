Like maybe even part of your relationship close. That\u2019s how Kylie feels about having her BFF Jordyn Woods hanging with her and her beaus all the time!\n\nJordyn Woods, 19, and Kylie Jenner, 19, have been BFFs for a very long time, so it\u2019s only natural they would put their friendship before any relationships. Or, you know, just sort of combine them a bit. Thats what Kylie and Jordyn say ends up happening whenever the lip kit mogul is in a relationship \u2014 which is pretty often.\n\n\u201cI become an extended leg of their relationship,\u201d Jordyn told E! News\u2018 Erin Lim in an exclusive interview. \u201cWhoever she\u2019s with.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s like the third wheel,\u201d Kylie said, agreeing with her bestie, adding, \u201cI feel like I really am always in a relationship, so we\u2019re kind of used to it. If I was single, she would probably not be friends with me because I would just want to be with her all the time.\u201d\n\nThe model went on to joke with Kylie about how she hasn\u2019t known her \u201cever to not be in a relationship\u201d \u2014 which is pretty true seeing as in the last year Kylie ended her relationship with longtime on-again, off-again boyfriend Tyga, and quickly started up a new one with Travis Scott. \u201cSometimes the guy has to understand like, \u2018Right now it\u2019s our time,'\u201d she said.\n\nIn the sneak peek of tonight\u2019s premiere of Life of Kylie, Jordyn talks about the bond she shares with the youngest member of the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star. \u201cWe have a special connection where we just get each other,\u201d she said. \u201cKnowing you could tell them like, \u2018Hey, I just killed someone, I need you to come\u2026\u2019 Not saying we would ever do that.\u201d Life of Kylie premieres tonight, Aug. 5 at 9 p.m. on E!.
