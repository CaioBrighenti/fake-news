File Photo by Jim Ruymen/UPI | License Photo\n\nMarch 22 (UPI) -- Sarah Hyland says doctors won't listen to her concerns about \"chronic pain.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old actress vented frustration in a tweet Wednesday that doctors are \"not listening\" to her complaints about ongoing health issues.\n\n\"For those who are chronically ill and in chronic pain: Have you had the experience of doctors not listening to you? If so, how do you not tear their heads off with your bare hands? :),\" she wrote.\n\nHyland didn't specify her issues, but appeared to be resting and recovering in a photo on Instagram Stories. The picture shows the star relaxing at home with her dog.\n\n\"My life for the next 6 to 8 weeks. I'm ok with it,\" she wrote.\n\nHyland has previously spoken about her battle with kidney dysplasia, which required her to undergo a kidney transplant in 2012. She said in May 2017 that her much-discussed weight loss was due to her being put on bed rest for months.\n\n\"My circumstances have put me in a place where I'm not in control of what my body looks like. So I strive to be as healthy as possible, as everyone should,\" the actress said.\n\nFor those who are chronically ill and in chronic pain: Have you had the experience of doctors not listening to you? If so, how do you not tear their heads off with your bare hands? :) \u2014 Sarah Hyland (@Sarah_Hyland) March 21, 2018\n\nHyland is known for playing Haley Dunphy on the ABC series Modern Family. The show co-stars Ariel Winter, who supported boyfriend Levi Meaden the Los Angeles premiere of Pacific Rim Uprising on Wednesday.", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/related/7641562765490/6/v1.2/c39295d31411162faf74ae15e62cccd5/upi/The-cast-of-Stranger-Things-3-attends-the-premiere.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/expand_gallery.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15071286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/para/ss/i/5261521731424/2018/5/1/15217340805814/Sarah-Hyland-says-doctors-wont-listen-to-her-chronic-pain-concerns.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4621562907259/2019/upi/24864105aebfdedab071cd61925fb4dc/v1.5/R-Kelly-faces-federal-kidnapping-child-sex-racketeering-charges.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7191562865263/2019/upi/dd7c8c20a88724f042688075dfb2e55c/v1.5/Christine-Baranskis-Good-Fight-moves-from-streaming-to-network.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4691562947708/2019/upi/93608c5b7949951fad4700562606e8f1/v1.5/Oprah-Winfrey-opens-private-road-to-help-Maui-fire-evacuations.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2211562518286/2019/upi/c81a68a1a9a765aae722442766e0e2c0/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-July-12-Michelle-Rodriguez-Malala-Yousafzai.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3181562849796/2019/upi/36d4ca61fb09350bdaaa89535b3155aa/v1.5/Real-Housewives-alum-Gretchen-Rossi-gives-birth-to-daughter.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-hqtKxhsRLFLuJ.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/5261521731424/2018/1/9f7849a0bba2c286c329baf28273ff63/v1.5/Sarah-Hyland-says-doctors-wont-listen-to-her-chronic-pain-concerns.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/5261521731424/2018/1/9f7849a0bba2c286c329baf28273ff63/Sarah-Hyland-says-doctors-wont-listen-to-her-chronic-pain-concerns.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/upi/dw/img/clear.gif"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/5261521731424/2018/1/9f7849a0bba2c286c329baf28273ff63/v1.5/Sarah-Hyland-says-doctors-wont-listen-to-her-chronic-pain-concerns.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2018/03/22/Sarah-Hyland-says-doctors-wont-listen-to-her-chronic-pain-concerns/5261521731424/", "title": "Sarah Hyland says doctors won't listen to her 'chronic pain' concerns", "meta_data": {"description": "\"Modern Family\" star Sarah Hyland said doctors are \"not listening\" to her complaints about ongoing health issues.", "keywords": "Entertainment, Sarah Hyland, Ariel Winter", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Sarah Hyland, Ariel Winter", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "\"Modern Family\" star Sarah Hyland said doctors are \"not listening\" to her complaints about ongoing health issues.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2018/03/22/Sarah-Hyland-says-doctors-wont-listen-to-her-chronic-pain-concerns/5261521731424/", "title": "Sarah Hyland says doctors won't listen to her 'chronic pain' concerns", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/5261521731424/2018/3/82225b316386e468361eca4984398fb2/v1.5/Sarah-Hyland-says-doctors-wont-listen-to-her-chronic-pain-concerns.jpg", "width": 441, "height": 293}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "creator": "@littlemannie", "title": "Sarah Hyland says doctors won't listen to her 'chronic pain' concerns", "description": "\"Modern Family\" star Sarah Hyland said doctors are \"not listening\" to her complaints about ongoing health issues.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5261521731424/2018/upi/9f7849a0bba2c286c329baf28273ff63/v2.1/Sarah-Hyland-says-doctors-wont-listen-to-her-chronic-pain-concerns.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521691200.0, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
