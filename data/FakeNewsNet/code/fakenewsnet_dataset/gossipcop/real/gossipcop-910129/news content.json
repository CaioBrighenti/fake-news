Between them, they decided to send the hair to a charity that makes wigs for children going through cancer treatments.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Express, seven inches of royal hair was anonymously sent to a charity called the Little Princess Trust. The Herefordshire-based organization makes wigs from real hair and donates them to children who have lost their own hair through chemotherapy or radiation treatments.\n\nImage zoom Kate Middleton debuts shorter haircut in July 2017 Karwai Tang/WireImage\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to think that somebody, somewhere \u2014 probably more than one person \u2014 has received a wig containing Princess Kate\u2019s hair,\u201d Helen Creese, a spokesperson for the charity, tells PEOPLE, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a really lovely thought and it\u2019s fantastic for raising awareness, plus it\u2019s gorgeous hair \u2014 we all lust after that hair!\u201d\n\nFounded in 2006 by parents Wendy and Simon Tarplee in memory of their daughter Hannah, who died from cancer in 2005, the charity has since funded over 5,500 wigs for sick children \u2014 both boys and girls \u2014 and it can take anything from seven to 10 donations to make just one wig.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the charity\u2019s first brush with fame! Harry Styles supported the charity in 2016 by cutting off his ponytail and donating his hair. A picture he posted on social media of him holding his lobbed-off hair attracted over two million likes.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Comparing Meghan & Princess Kate\u2019s Style \u2013 Why Meghan Will Likely

that many donations are anonymous.\n\n\u201cWe like to thank everyone and send out little certificates to all our donors, but lots of people don\u2019t fill in the paperwork and they don\u2019t feel the need to be acknowledged in that way, but we are always very grateful,\u201d he says.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/princess-diana1.jpg",
