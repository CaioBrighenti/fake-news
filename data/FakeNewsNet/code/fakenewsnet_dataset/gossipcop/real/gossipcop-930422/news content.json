She smashed more music industry records than any other female singer in history, and she remains to be the only artist to clinch seven consecutive U.S. No. 1 singles. But she left us too soon. And now six years after her tragic death, Oscar-winning filmmaker Kevin Macdonald is bringing the story of \u201cThe Voice\u201d to the big screen in the first ever estate-approved documentary titled Whitney.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know her story until you hear the truth,\u201d the trailer for the upcoming feature proclaims. Whitney will give us an in-depth, \u201cunflinching\u201d look at Houston\u2019s life \u2014 her troubled past, rise to stardom, numerous struggles, and complicated relationship with fame. It will showcase clips of never-before-seen footage, demo recordings, rare performances, audio archives, and interviews with her closest friends and family, allowing fans to get to know the star like they never have before. The documentary will also serve as a reminder that even though she\u2019s gone, we will *always* love Whitney.\n\n\u201cYou have three places to sing from: heart, mind, guts,\u201d her mother, Grammy-winning soul singer Emily \u201cCissy\u201d Houston, says. \u201cShe learned them all.\u201d\n\n\"I approached Whitney\u2019s life like a mystery story; why did someone with so much raw talent and beauty self-destruct so publicly and painfully?\" Director Kevin Macdonald said in a statement. \"I was lucky enough to have the support of Pat Houston and the Whitney Houston estate in this quest. They entrusted me with the \u2018keys to the vault\u2019 while giving me complete freedom to follow the story wherever it went. At heart, Whitney is an intimate family story that reveals a new side to a woman that even her most die-hard fans never knew.\"\n\nWatch the Whitney trailer below:\n\nWhitney will have its debut at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival in May and hits theaters on July 6th.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09101322/Ariana-Grande-in-My-head-Video.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/24163228/megantheestallion.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02104813/tgif-comedies-family-matters-e1562089707800.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/07114801/alwaysbemymaybe.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/12130629/latenight-mindykaling.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/14070645/lili-reinhart-chemical-hearts-e1560521229941.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/19091149/aliceguyblache.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/30045435/cersei.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/03161937/friends-e1543882785629.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/30152125/do-the-right-thing.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/07112455/dan-levy-eugene-levy-e1559931905123.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09090218/gordon-e1562688256883.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28105746/charlies-angels1-e1561744715378.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/20102635/friends-e1545330449309.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/27105118/whitney-e1524851566235.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/11081604/gettyimages-1148329706.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01095706/melissa-mccarthy-e1562000253438.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072547/avatar-h-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/24081819/Beyonce-Coachella.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/04064530/beyonce-nala.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02073323/Alison-Mack-NXIVM-Sex-Cult.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28083732/One-Day-at-a-Time.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/27105118/whitney-e1524851566235.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Cord-Cruz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/whitney-houston-documentary-trailer/", "title": "The first trailer for the documentary \"Whitney\" reminds us that we will ALWAYS love the iconic singer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "entertainment,movies,Whitney documentary,whitney houston,Entertainment,Movies,Music", "news_keywords": "entertainment,movies,Whitney documentary,whitney houston,Entertainment,Movies,Music", "description": "This summer, the first estate-approved documentary about Whitney Houston will hit the big screen, and judging from the first trailer for the movie, we're going to cry a lot.", "og": {"title": "The first trailer for the documentary \"Whitney\" reminds us that we will ALWAYS love the iconic singer", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/whitney-houston-documentary-trailer/", "description": "\"You don\u2019t know her story until you hear the truth.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/27105118/whitney-e1524851566235.jpg", "width": 649, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/whitney-houston-documentary-trailer/", "description": "This summer, the first estate-approved documentary about Whitney Houston will hit the big screen, and judging from the first trailer for the movie, we're going to cry a lot.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/27105118/whitney-e1524851566235.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/whitney-houston-documentary-trailer/", "title": "The first trailer for the documentary \"Whitney\" reminds us that we will ALWAYS love the iconic singer", "description": "\"You don\u2019t know her story until you hear the truth.\"", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/27105118/whitney-e1524851566235.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GKC_nj7B44?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
