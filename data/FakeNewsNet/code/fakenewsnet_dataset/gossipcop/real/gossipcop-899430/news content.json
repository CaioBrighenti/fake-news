In an Instagram post shared on Tuesday, Rodriguez shared never-before-seen photos of his stunning girlfriend, wishing her a happy birthday and letting her know how much he loves her.\n\n\"When we were kids, birthdays were exciting because it was all about the gifts we would be getting. A new bat, dance shoes, maybe a new CD (yes I\u2019m old!),\" he wrote alongside the Instagram slideshow. \"I see firsthand how that\u2019s changed for Jennifer, and how she\u2019s found joy in sharing with others.\"\n\n\"For someone who has been about giving everything she has 365 days a year -- to our children, our families, the world -- I hope today, we can give you all the happiness you deserve. I love you mucho Macha 13. \u2764\ufe0f\" he concluded.\n\nIn his second Instagram slideshow -- filled with pictures of Lopez dancing, cutting her cake, candid moments with their family and more -- A-Rod wrote, \"Birthday girl \ud83c\udf89.\"\n\nLopez and Rodriguez, along with their combined four children -- Lopez's 10-year-old twins, Maximilian and Emme, and Rodriguez's daughters, Ella, 10, and Natasha, 13 -- are enjoying a relaxing beach getaway.\n\nThe World of Dance judge has been documenting her birthday vacation on social media, sharing pics of her kids having some fun in the sun.\n\nInstagram\n\nThe mini trip is much needed as Lopez has been working non-stop, wrapping up the final Shades of Blue season, releasing new music and working on her dance competition show.
