Olympios smiles in the pic, and posted a simple flower emoji as the caption.\n\nWATCH: Corinne Olympios' Boyfriend Pledges His 'Unwavering Support' to Her Amid 'Bachelor in Paradise' Scandal\n\nOlympios also shared a playful selfie on Snapchat on Monday, using a star crown filter.\n\nSnapchat\n\nLast week, Olympios released a statement via her rep, Stan Rosenfield, stating that her team's investigation into what happened on the Bachelor in Paradise set had been completed to her satisfaction. She also said that she turned down an offer to return to the ABC show when production resumed.\n\n\"My intent over the past few weeks has been to learn and understand what happened on June 4,\" Olympios said in her statement. \"While I never filed complaints or accusations against anyone associated with Bachelor in Paradise, my team and I felt it was very important to be thorough in getting to the bottom of what had occurred.\"\n\n\"I felt victimized by the fact that others were judging me through conflicting and unsubstantiated reports, while I myself had no recollection of the events that transpired,\" she continued. \"My team\u2019s investigation into this matter has now been completed to my satisfaction. I am also happy about the changes that have been made to the production of Bachelor in Paradise.\"\n\nWarner Bros. and ABC announced on June 20 that Bachelor in Paradise would resume production on season four after concluding that no misconduct occurred between Olympios and 30-year-old Jackson. Though at the time, Olympios' lawyer, Marty Singer, told ET his and Olympios' own investigation would continue \"based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.\"\n\nWATCH: 'Bachelor Nation' Bombshells -- The Biggest Scandals in the History of the Franchise\n\nLast month, Jackson told his side of the story in a sit-down with E! News, and talked about race being a factor in the scandal.\n\n\"The minute you release this black man's face and this white girl's face, before either of us commented on it, I was already, like, a \u2018rapist,' and a -- excuse my French -- a '*ni****' and a 'monkey,'\" Jackson said. \"[Olympios was called] a 'whore' and 'she's a slut,' and they were slut-shaming her because of what she did last season with Nick [Viall].\"\n\n\"For me, it goes back to the human race -- we failed,\" he added.\n\nWatch below:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/bachelor_vidpic_063017_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=SMLUbil1", "https://www.etonline.com/modules/contrib/ctd_uvp/img/placeholder.gif", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161760651.jpg?itok=MLRyG4zA&h=bd7808dd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2017-07/775_corinne_olympios.jpg?itok=iEKL6IfV", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/street-style-outfit-nordstrom-anniversary-sale-1280.jpg?itok=eyAT2Bws&h=e6a33408"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/bachelor_vidpic_063017_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=SMLUbil1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Antoinette Bueno"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220928_corinne_olympios_returns_to_social_media_after_concluding_her_own_bachelor_paradise_investigation", "title": "Corinne Olympios Returns to Social Media After Concluding Her Own 'Bachelor in Paradise' Investigation", "meta_data": {"title": "Corinne Olympios Returns to Social Media After Concluding Her Own 'Bachelor in Paradise' Investigation | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220928_corinne_olympios_returns_to_social_media_after_concluding_her_own_bachelor_paradise_investigation", "title": "Corinne Olympios Returns to Social Media After Concluding Her Own 'Bachelor in Paradise' Investigation", "description": "Corinne Olympios Returns to Social Media After Concluding Her Own 'Bachelor in Paradise' Investigation", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/bachelor_vidpic_063017_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=SMLUbil1", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Corinne Olympios Returns to Social Media After Concluding Her Own 'Bachelor in Paradise' Investigation", "title": "Corinne Olympios Returns to Social Media After Concluding Her Own 'Bachelor in Paradise' Investigation", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Antoinette Bueno", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220928_corinne_olympios_returns_to_social_media_after_concluding_her_own_bachelor_paradise_investigation", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-06/bachelor_vidpic_063017_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=SMLUbil1"}, "description": "Corinne Olympios Returns to Social Media After Concluding Her Own 'Bachelor in Paradise' Investigation", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Bachelor In Paradise", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Bachelor In Paradise"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
