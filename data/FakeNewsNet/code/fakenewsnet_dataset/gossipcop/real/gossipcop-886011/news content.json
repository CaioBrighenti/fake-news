(Trump was married to Ivana from 1977 until 1992, and to Maples \u2014 with whom he shares daughter Tiffany \u2014 from 1993 to 1999. He married his third and current wife, First Lady Melania Trump, in 2005.)\n\nIn her book, Ivana refers to Maples almost exclusively as \u201cthe showgirl\u201d \u2014 and blasts her for \u201cknowingly entering into a relationship with my husband, the father of three small children.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Arnaldo Magnani/Getty\n\n\u201cShe actively participated in humiliating me in the media and indirectly put my kids at risk for months,\u201d writes Ivana, who has three children with Trump: Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. \u201cI went through hell, and then I was expected to be okay with her being around my children?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have deep scars from that period of our lives, in part due to her actions,\u201d she adds.\n\nIvana also criticizes Maples\u2019 stint last year as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, which Trump\u2019s first wife called a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo class!\u201d Ivana said, adding that she\u2019s been asked to appear on the show \u201ca hundred times \u2014 and offered a mint.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Getty (2)\n\n\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t go on that show, dancing in those tiny dresses with the boobs and butt hanging out,\u201d she added.\n\nIvana also slammed Marla for the timing of her DWTS appearance: \u201cThe showgirl appeared on DWTS when (because) her ex-husband was running for president! It was disrespectful to do the show. I never would have embarrassed Donald that way.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack\n\nIvana went on to recall how Maples recently tried to make amends via an interview with the Daily Mail. \u201cThey called to ask if I accepted the apology and I said, \u2018Apology not accepted.\u2019 This woman broke up my marriage and took away my kids\u2019 father. I don\u2019t care how sorry she is.\u201d\n\nIvana also referenced a PEOPLE interview with Maples from last year in which she said, \u201cIf [Ivana is] holding any kind of resentment toward me, I really hope, for her sake, that she can forgive me.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor my sake? She wants my absolution for her sake,\u201d Ivana writes, adding that she\u2019s \u201cdoing just fine with my resentment, thank you very much.\u201d\n\nDespite her obvious disdain for Maples, Ivana denied reports that she left her ex-husband\u2019s January inauguration early to avoid an \u201cawkward run-in with Marla freaking Maples at the party that night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know she was there! It was ridiculous,\u201d Ivana writes, saying the real reason for her early departure was to get her elderly mother back home to New York.\n\n\u201cThat said, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t see Marla that day, or any other day since our two-minute confrontation in 1989 in Aspen,\u201d Ivana writes, referencing the moment she confronted Maples about the affair on the ski slopes of Aspen, Colorado, during a vacation with Trump.\n\nDuring her interview with CBS Sunday Morning, which recently aired, Ivana was asked how she gets along fine with Melania but not with Maples. \u201cOne is nobody. And the other one is First Lady,\u201d Ivana replied.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tiffany-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630",
