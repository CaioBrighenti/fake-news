News. \u201cI take a mini trampoline with me and I\u2019ve got to do a real pre-show show.\u201d\n\nThe 52-year-old country icon insists her new concert series is \u201cstill sexy\u201d despite the change in her routine behind-the-scenes, revealing she and her crew have crafted shows with \u201csomething nobody has seen before.\u201d\n\nShania is grateful she caught the condition early, because it could have been much worse.\n\n\u201cLyme disease does affect your life for sure. It\u2019s such a silent, evil thing,\u201d she shared. \u201cA lot of the symptoms you just learn to live with. I was lucky that I caught it early. I did get a lot of damage but I\u2019m not battling with degenerative organ issues, so I feel very fortunate.\u201d\n\nShania went public with her Lyme disease diagnosis last summer (Jul17) and she is now looking at the illness as a source of empowerment and confidence.\n\n\u201cBy the time you\u2019re my age, you have something. Everybody\u2019s got something in some form of their life,\u201d she smiled. \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself on one hand for persevering.\u201d\n\nShania\u2019s Now Tour kicks off in Tacoma, Washington on 3 May (18).", "images":
