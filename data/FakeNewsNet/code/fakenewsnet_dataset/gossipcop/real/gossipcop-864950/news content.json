Will describes the mystery subject to Grace: \"OK, he\u2019s a man, but he\u2019s aged into a lesbian.\"\n\n\"Newt Gingrich!\u201d she immediately yells.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack (Sean Hayes) demonstrates he's kept up with the dating world while the show was off the air.\n\n\"Grindr has gotten so skanky,\u201d he complains while swiping options on his phone. \u201cI feel like I could get finger herpes just from scrolling.\"\n\nSee the gang's hilarious high jinks in the video above!\n\nIn addition to the new preview, Messing shared more excitement on Instagram with this photo of Harry Connick, Jr. (who played Grace's ex-husband during the show's original run) on the set.\n\n\"Will & Grace\" returns to NBC on Thursday, Sept. 28 at 9 p.m. EST.", "images":
