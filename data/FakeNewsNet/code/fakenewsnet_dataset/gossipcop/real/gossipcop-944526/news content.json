She was my love, my dearest companion, and her kisses and hugs made every morning a celebration. Our hearts are broken, but we will never forget the nine months she graced this pained planet with her radiance. #giamarieforever,\u201d she continued, sharing the sad news alongside a series of photos of her sphynx cat.\n\nIn another emotional post, Dunham, 32, went on to reveal that after coming home to find Gia \u201climp and wheezing,\u201d the cat died in her arms while being rushed to the vet.\n\n\u201cYesterday I was due at work at 8am. Showed up, watched rehearsal, drank my Starbucks, chill times. But at 8:15 I started to feel sick. Chills, sore throat, rapid descent. So I told Jenni I had to go home. Now. It just felt urgent. I walked in the door and found Gia limp and wheezing. She died in my arms at 9:15 as we rushed to the vet. She called me home. I\u2019m so glad I listened,\u201d she explained.\n\nIn a separate post, she simply wrote, \u201cMy tiny baby Gia, gone but never forgotten \ud83d\udc94.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Medical Challenges, Dog Drama and More: A Look Back at Lena Dunham\u2019s Emotional Year\n\nJust three days before her pet\u2019s death, Dunham spoke warmly about her cat on social media.\n\n\u201cI have two cats but only one sleeps on my face and sits on my lap while I pee. The positive effect Gia Maria Carangi has had on my mental health cannot be overestimated,\u201d she captioned a photo of the pair.\n\nEarlier this year, the writer and actress also gave the cat a special \u201cwoman crush wednesday\u201d shoutout, writing, \u201c#WCW #2 is Gia Marie Carangi the cat in her new angora lewk (she cares not what you feel about her nude belly. Like mama like baby.)\u201d\n\nLast year, Dunham found herself embroiled in some doggy drama after sharing that she and then-boyfriend Jack Antonoff had decided to re-home their dog Lamby, following \u201cfour years of challenging behavior and aggression.\u201d\n\nThe writer experienced a backlash on social media, some of which centered on her claim that her dog\u2019s behavioral issues were caused by \u201cterrible abuse\u201d Lamby suffered in the past. Robert Vazquez, a spokesperson for the shelter that Dunham adopted Lamby from, went on to say that the dog \u201cwasn\u2019t crazy\u201d when Dunham adopted him.\n\nHowever, Dunham\u2019s dog trainer Matt Beisner, came to her defense. \u201cShe was at her wit\u2019s end,\u201d he said.\n\nDunham still has three pets at home: a sphinx cat named Irma and poodles Karen and Susan.", "images":
