Hugh Grant was born in London on September 9, 1960. He is known for his performances in many films, in which he frequently portrays both the hopeless romantic or a sleazy, but oh-so-attractive jerk. Grant graduated from New College in Oxford where he studied English literature, and acted purely for pleasure. He never thought of having a career in the entertainment industry. However, Grant soon performed in a touring production of \"Twelfth Night,\" and started participating in the Oxford University Dramatic Society.\n\nBefore becoming famous, Grant tried his hand at a variety of different jobs, such as writing book reviews, writing radio commercials, and tutoring. Eventually, Grant returned to acting, performing in many plays in England. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Grant was offered roles in smaller films, such as \"Bitter Moon\", directed by Roman Polanski, and intellectual films, such as \"The Remains of the Day\". His big breakout role that made him a huge star came in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" . It was the highest-grossing British film at the time, and Grant was awarded a Golden Globe. Grant went on to make films such as \"Mickey Blue Eyes\", \"Bridget Jones' Diary\", \"Love Actually\", \"Notting Hill\" and many more. Critics often praise Grant's performances, however, he is sometimes considered to have no versatility in his career, and constantly turns to the same jokes. Hugh has been linked to a number of beautiful women during his life, most notably Liz Hurley. Grant and Hurley spent 13 years together before separating in 2000. Hugh has a daughter and a son with a woman named Tinglan Hong who was working as a receptionist at a Chinese restuarant in London when they met. Hugh has a third child with a Swedish TV producer.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-504136806-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/epstein.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Elizabeth-Hurley.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Hugh-Grant.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/GettyImages-488355885-e1557100267439.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-167802829.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gina.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Caroline-Stanbury.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Robert-Downey-Jr.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brandon-Thomas-Lee.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Nicholas-Hoult-e1558546130428.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1093667182.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-502228488.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-300x300/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Hugh-Grant.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Leonardo-DiCaprio.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tc.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1160570133.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Tom-Hanks1-e1558999027688.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cc.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Katie-Holmes-e1557157753956.jpg"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Hugh-Grant.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/hugh-grant-net-worth/", "title": "Hugh Grant Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Hugh Grant net worth: Hugh Grant is a British actor and producer who has a net worth of $80 million.
