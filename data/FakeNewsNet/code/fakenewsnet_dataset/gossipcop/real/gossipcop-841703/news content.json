Andrew Rannells\u2019 Elijah came too, as did host Jimmy Kimmel, starring as the son of one of the four friends. Inappropriate nudity and drug references abound in the six-minute sketch, which can be seen above.\n\nGirls airs Sundays on HBO.\n\nEARLIER: The stars of Girls have just found a Golden opportunity to spoof themselves.\n\nWednesday on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Lena Dunham & co. will show you what life will hold for them after this sixth and final season of their HBO comedy, and it looks like they\u2019re going to be thanking each for being a friend.\n\nCheck out the preview of tonight\u2019s action with a re-imagination of The Golden Girls\u2018 opening credits, featuring Dunham still naked after all these years, Zosia Mamet channeling the fist-eating Dorothy, and well\u2026 just brace yourself for some slow-moving closet hijinks.\n\nRELATED: Girls and 19 Other HBO Original Series Gems\n\nJimmy
