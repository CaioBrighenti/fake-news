Blige, Raphael Saadiq and Taura Stinson\n\nTime tells no lies\n\nIt keeps changing, and ticking, and moving,\n\nthen passes by\n\nBut if you're lucky, it will be kind\n\nLike a river flowing through time\n\nSinger Mary J. Blige received two Oscar nominations this year \u2013 for co-writing this Best Original Song nominee, and for Best Supporting Actress, for her performance as Florence in this period drama about a sharecropping family in the post-war South.\n\nWhile the film unnecessarily veers at times towards the melodramatic, Blige's acting performance is delicately shaded and real -- and her musical performance of \"Mighty River\" is soulful and inspiring.\n\n\"Mystery of Love,\" from \"Call Me by Your Name\"\n\nMusic and Lyric by Sufjan Stevens\n\nHow much sorrow can I take?\n\nBlackbird on my shoulder\n\nAnd what difference does it make\n\nWhen this love is over?\n\nShall I sleep within your bed\n\nRiver of unhappiness\n\nHold your hands upon my head\n\nTill I breathe my last breath\n\nOh, oh woe-oh-woah is me\n\nThe last time that you touched me\n\nOh, will wonders ever cease?\n\nBlessed be the mystery of love\n\nSinger-songwriter Sufjan Stevens wrote two songs (including \"Mystery of Love\") for Luca Guadagnino's Best Picture nominee, \"Call Me By Your Name,\" about a teenage boy spending a summer in Italy who falls into a romance with an older man.\n\nThe music captures the idealism, fantasy and disappointments of first love. And while the film is a memory piece, the music is ever-present, keeping the innocence and heartbreak of youth at the fore.\n\n\"Remember Me,\" from \"Coco\"\n\nMusic and Lyric by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez\n\nRemember me\n\nThough I have to say goodbye\n\nRemember me\n\nDon't let it make you cry\n\nFor ever if I'm far away\n\nI hold you in my heart\n\nI sing a secret song to you\n\nEach night we are apart\n\nAnderson-Lopez and Lopez previously won for \"Let It Go\" from the Disney animated film \"Frozen.\" For Pixar's animated tale inspired by Mexico's Day of the Dead, they contributed a lovely bi-lingual song about memory and family that is played in a variety of styles -- including a lullaby, a boisterous ranchera song, and a romantic ballad.\n\n\"Stand Up For Something\" from \"Marshall\"\n\nMusic by Diane Warren; Lyric by Lonnie R. Lynn and Diane Warren\n\nIt all means nothing\n\nIf you don't stand up for something\n\nYou can't just talk the talk\n\nYou got to walk that walk, yes you do\n\nIt all means nothing\n\nIf you don't stand up for something\n\nFor Reginald Hudlin's biopic of lawyer and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, Lonnie R. Lynn and Diane Warren composed a song about ethics and dignity. Andra Day's powerful performance elevates the song beyond the film's 1950s storyline, to make it timeless.\n\nLynn previously won the Oscar for \"Glory\" (from \"Selma\"). Warren has eight previous nominations.\n\n\"This Is Me,\" from \"The Greatest Showman\"\n\nMusic and Lyric by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul\n\nWhen the sharpest words wanna cut me down\n\nI'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out\n\nI am brave, I am bruised\n\nI am who I'm meant to be, this is me\n\nLook out 'cause here I come\n\nAnd I'm marching on to the beat I drum\n\nI'm not scared to be seen\n\nI make no apologies, this is me\n\nThe song in the video clip above featuring Keala Settle, from the P.T. Barnum musical biopic \"The Greatest Showman,\" exudes pride and defiance about overcoming prejudice and ignorance. Like the film, it makes no apologies about not being subtle.\n\nThe songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul previously shared an Oscar win (\"City of Stars\") and a nomination (\"Audition\") for \"La La Land.\"\n\nSee also:\n\nFor more info:", "images":
