His termination comes after a string of firings of top stars in television news, following the ouster of Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly last April and CBS\u2019 Charlie Rose earlier this month.\n\n\u201cOn Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company\u2019s standards. As a result, we\u2019ve decided to terminate his employment,\u201d Andrew Lack, chairman of NBC News, said in a statement. \u201cWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he\u2019s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.\n\n\u201cOur highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by this turn of events. But we will face it together as a news organization \u2014 and do it in as transparent a manner as we can. To that end, Noah and I will be meeting with as many of you as possible throughout the day today to answer your questions.\u201d\n\nA source told PEOPLE Lauer was fired after alleged inappropriate sexual behavior throughout 2014, including at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nAn NBC staffer filed a complaint Monday \u201cthat was serious enough that he was terminated,\u201d the source explained. \u201cThe accuser described inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace occurring throughout 2014.\u201d\n\nReps for Lauer declined to comment.\n\nA Today source, meanwhile, told PEOPLE the team was shocked by the news.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a death in the family. Everybody is crying,\u201d said the source. \u201cNo one knows what the f\u2014 happened.\u201d", "images":
