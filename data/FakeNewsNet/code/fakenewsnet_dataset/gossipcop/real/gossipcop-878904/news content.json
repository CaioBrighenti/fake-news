He wore a classic black suit jacket, crisp white button-down shirt and long skinny black tie.\n\nOn Thursday, he had been spotted at an airport in the Big Apple \u2014 wearing a camouflage-printed baseball cap, a blue fitted half-zip sweater, grey pants and white sneakers as he pulled his luggage before grabbing a taxi.\n\nJoynt, who withdrew from Juan Pablo Galavis\u2018 season, married fianc\u00e9 Andy Levine at New York City\u2019s Battery Park Gardens on Friday \u2014 two years after Joynt announced the engagement on Instagram in February 2015.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s the day!\u201d she wrote on Instagram Friday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m marrying this #silverfox tonight and couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Sharleen Joynt marries Andy Levine BACKGRID\n\nSoules \u2014 who appeared on season 19 of The Bachelor in 2015 \u2014 was not charged with driving under the influence, though court documents reveal Soules was in possession of alcoholic beverages/containers.\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol alleged that Soules fled the scene. His vehicle was later found at a home that he was present at, and Soules allegedly refused to leave until officers obtained a search warrant several hours later.\n\nImage zoom Jackson Lee/Splash\n\n\u201cMr. Soules would not come out of the home. It took hours to get a search warrant to retrieve Mr. Soules from inside of that house in order to continue the investigation. That took hours,\u201d the state prosecutor said in court. \u201cAt no point did Mr. Soules come out of the house, or cooperate with law enforcement at any point in trying to get in contact with him regarding this individual and the [fatal] accident.\u201d\n\nSoules entered a not guilty plea in May to the charge of leaving the scene of the fatal accident in April. He called 911, identified himself and attempted to administer aid to victim.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Bachelor\u2018s Chris Soules in Jail After Arrest for Allegedly Leaving the Scene of Deadly Crash\n\nIn June, Soules\u2019 legal team filed court documents, which were obtained by PEOPLE, that stated the former Bachelor did not have alcohol or drugs in his system following the fatal crash.\n\n\u201cA report issued by the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigation\u2019s (DCI) Criminalistics Laboratory, Mr. Soules\u2019 specimens were negative for drugs and alcohol,\u201d his legal team said in the documents.\n\n\u201cThe DCI conducted thorough toxicology testing on two separate samples \u2013 his urine and blood \u2013 and conclusively determined no detectable amounts of alcohol or drugs were in either specimen,\u201d they continued. \u201cFurthermore, Mr. Soules has not been charged with any alcohol related offense. Rather, Mr. Soules has been charged with leaving the scene of a fatal accident.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Chris Soules Ray Tamarra/GC Images\n\nAccording to the documents, Soules\u2019 legal team also claims that the following are \u201cnot admissible\u201d and has filed a motion that they not be used in reference to the case or presented to a jury: \u201cAny evidence, testimony, reference, or argument that, on the night in question, Mr. Soules: 1) purchased alcohol, 2) consumed alcohol, 2) drove while impaired, or 3) had beer cans in or around his vehicle.\u201d\n\nHis team is also requested that Moser, who died at Mercy Hospital in Oelwein after his tractor and the pickup truck crashed, as reported by KWWL.com, not be referred to a \u201cvictim\u201d during the trial.\n\n\u201cMr. Soules, like all other accused persons in the State of Iowa, is presumed innocent,\u201d the documents read, and also state that, \u201cThe State has not charged Mr. Soules with any crime asserting he is criminally responsible for the death of the decedent. Thus, it is wholly improper for the State or any witness to refer to the decedent as a \u2018victim\u2019 since such a reference inaccurately characterizes the events relevant to the instant charge.\u201d\n\nSoules\u2019 trail is slated for January.", "images":
