So I suspect I speak for most of us viewers when I say that, as we watched this singularly upsetting hour of television, we most certainly did lose our minds and did not hold it together. Did Kepner pull through in the end? Keep the tissues handy, and read on\u2026\n\n\u2018WE\u2019RE NOT GONNA LOSE HER\u2019 | As the penultimate Season 14 episode began, April was fine, sending out invitations to Jolex\u2019s wedding when her ride honked. \u201cIt might be too fancy for me to go to,\u201d joked Jo upon receiving the invite. Meanwhile, Amelia rushed to Owen\u2019s because\u2026 Betty was back. And she hadn\u2019t relapsed. She was six days clean. Rather than let the teen out of her sight, she took her to work with her for a consult. At the hospital, Arizona gave Bailey her notice; she was leaving to scrub in at Mount Sinai. The chief was not pleased. Turned out, Amelia\u2019s consult was with Geena Davis\u2019 Herman, who cracked that she and Arizona looked swell before admitting that she was still blind as an earthworm. At the coffee cart, Maggie clarified that she and Jackson were attending the wedding together \u2014 sort of their first public outing as a couple. Shortly, Matthew came in on an ambulance \u2014 he\u2019d rolled his car and was in rough shape. OK, so now we knew for sure who April\u2019s ride had been. But where was she?!? While Jo revealed that she and Alex had a cake-tasting with Kepner at 11, an ambulance raced back to the scene of Matthew\u2019s accident, Owen in tow. At the site, he spotted April unconscious, her lower extremities apparently chilling in a frigid lake. At that very moment, Mer was back at Grey Sloan asking Jackson if he knew where his ex was. When she received Owen\u2019s text, she elected not to fill in Avery, as he was about to go into surgery. By the time the ambulance arrived at Grey Sloan, Owen reported that April was hypothermic, with no pulse and no vitals, and an EMT added that they had no way of knowing how long she\u2019d been down. \u201cI think we lost her,\u201d said another EMT. \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t,\u201d replied her friends almost in unison.\n\nWhile Mer paged Maggie, Bailey explained to the interns that they had to raise April\u2019s temperature before they could try to jump-start her heart. The team accomplished that by working to pump blood through her body manually. An hour later, with Mer and Maggie still at it, Pierce urged her half sister to tell Jackson. When she ran into Alex in the corridor and he mentioned his appointment with April, Mer burst into tears. (She wasn\u2019t the only one!) In the O.R., as docs took turns pumping blood through Kepner, Alex admitted that he\u2019d hated her at first, because he\u2019d wanted to be more like her. Nurturing, caring, all that good stuff, she just was naturally. \u201cYou gotta stop saying \u2018was,'\u201d Mer told him. Nearby, Richard operated on Matthew, whose spleen wasn\u2019t looking so good. To feel like she was doing something, anything, Bailey pitched in. \u201cThis boy must be cursed,\u201d Webber sighed. He might be onto something there, too. Jackson was fresh out of surgery and informing Jo that he was basically broke when he overheard Casey say they needed all the blood to save Kepner\u2019s life. Not the way he should\u2019ve found out.\n\n\u2018DON\u2019T TAKE APRIL, PLEASE\u2019 | Bursting into the O.R., Avery learned that April had been there for three hours. Nothing to do but wait. \u201cAnd pray,\u201d said Owen, asking everyone to do what April would\u2019ve wanted and pray for her. From there, the group waited to see any sign of a heartbeat in April, and Maggie, eventually convinced that she had, began using the EKG paddles on her over and over. Finally, Pierce actually did get a rhythm, and they \u2014 and we \u2014 breathed a huge sigh of relief. In recovery, Matthew came to and immediately asked about April. At that very moment, Amelia was noting that Kepner\u2019s brainwaves were slow and irregular. As soon as Arizona found out what had happened, she rushed into her friend\u2019s room and explained that April and Matthew had been seeing each other again for months. They\u2019d even fallen back in love. Soon, Ben arrived and was welcomed with a huge hug by Bailey. Overnight, it appeared, April\u2019s friends sat at her bedside. At this point, to my relief, I was thinking, \u201cOK, she\u2019s gonna pull through!\u201d But then it seemed for an awful instant like she was basically brain-dead. Tearfully, Jackson told April that he didn\u2019t just want to believe she was still there, he would believe it. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want,\u201d he then told God. \u201cDon\u2019t take her away, OK?\u201d And at that second, she squeezed his hand \u2014 ever so gently \u2014 and opened her eyes. Lord, what an emotional roller coaster! As Amelia reported that April\u2019s reflexes were good, Kepner related that she remembered calling 911, feeling warmer and warmer and safer\u2026 \u201cAnd then I was here,\u201d she said, delighting in pointing out to Jackson that \u201cyou prayed for me, and it worked.\u201d She quickly added that she hadn\u2019t died and come back \u2014 that was Jesus\u2019 jam. Before they all left her to get some rest, April thanked Owen. \u201cYou always come and bring me back,\u201d she said. Later, April thanked Maggie, too, for saving her life, and at last she was reunited with Matthew.\n\n\u2018SO YOU DID BRAIN SURGERY WHILE YOU NEEDED BRAIN SURGERY?\u2019 | During Amelia\u2019s consult on Nicole\u2019s case, Grey Sloan\u2019s former Head of Fetal Surgery complained of headaches and dizziness. She also revealed to Arizona that she\u2019d been keeping tabs on her career and was eager to catch up. Ticked at having been abandoned by her teacher, blind or not, Robbins didn\u2019t appear quite so keen to. When Arizona revealed to Herman that she was going back into peds and leaving behind fetal surgery, her former mentor balked that that was unacceptable. After Nicole\u2019s scan, she ordered Arizona not to even consider quitting fetal surgery. \u201cAfter blind school, I hit a rough patch,\u201d Nicole said by way of explaining why she\u2019d ghosted Robbins. \u201cI went very, very dark.\u201d But hearing what Arizona had been up to had excited her \u2014 Herman had succeeded in downloading into Robbins her whole brain! It made her realize that she could teach and create a whole lot more Arizonas. And \u201cthat saved my life,\u201d she said. At the same time, Amelia feared that Nicole\u2019s tumor was back, but she just couldn\u2019t find it, damn it. If the tumor was back, Amelia resolved, she was telling Herman that she\u2019d had a tumor when she operated on Nicole. During a spinal tap on Herman, Arizona and DeLuca learned that Nicole didn\u2019t have a tumor. When Amelia then tried to refer Nicole to Koracick to have her shunt put in, Herman revealed that she\u2019d overheard \u2014 while in Tom\u2019s bed! \u2014 all about her former doc\u2019s huge, honking tumor. Left alone with Arizona, Herman told her that she\u2019d just gotten a grant and wanted to move forward with the Robbins Herman Center for Women\u2019s Health and launch Arizona\u2019s cart program. \u201cCould we do it in New York?\u201d Robbins said. \u201cWe could do it wherever you want,\u201d Nicole replied before asking Arizona to warn her the next time she\u2019s lunging in for an embrace.\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S GONNA BE SO BEAUTIFUL\u2019 | As the episode came to a close, Betty confessed to Amelia that she hadn\u2019t really been clean for six days and had been too high to miss her son. She\u2019d only come home because she\u2019d been cold. Not surprised, Amelia took her straight to a meeting. When Jackson passed by the chapel on his way out of the hospital with Harriet, he couldn\u2019t help but stop in to say a silent thank you. At home in bed with a snoozing Ben, Bailey appeared to be mulling something over, something big. Jolex looked forward to their wedding; Mer, realizing how lucky she was to have once pulled through a trauma that had been chillingly similar to April\u2019s, took a sweet gaze at Derek\u2019s Post-It wedding vows before placing his cap on top of them in her drawer; and Kepner and Matthew recovered with their hospital beds pushed up against one another.\n\nSo, how did you handle \u201cCold as Ice\u201d? Relieved much? And since April survived, what do you make of Ellen Pompeo\u2019s remark that the finale is \u201cnot easy\u201d?
