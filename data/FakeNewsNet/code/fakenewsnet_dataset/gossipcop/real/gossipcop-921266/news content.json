Marc was incredible in the deliver room,\" the caption read. \"I lost a lot of blood so I'm very weak but they both were strong for me.\"\n\nAccording to People, Moore underwent an emergency cesarean section due to preeclampsia - \"a pregnancy complication that caused her to gain 17 lbs. in ONE week due to severe swelling and water retention, high blood pressure, and excess protein in urine.\"\n\nMoore married Daly, a restaurateur, in a ceremony last year on a St. Lucia beach.\n\nOne of her story lines on \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" had been Moore's desire to have a husband and children.\n\nWhen Bravo executive and host Andy Cohen asked Moore during the reunion whether she was hoping for a boy or a girl she said, \"I want a healthy baby.\"", "images":
