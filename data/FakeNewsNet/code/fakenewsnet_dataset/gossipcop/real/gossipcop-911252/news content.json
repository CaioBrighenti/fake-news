While the choice was dump or donate, many did both and the ALS Association raised a historic $115 million for the devastating disease, per the website. From there, over $96 million has been committed to research projects. You can check the progress on those projects here. And now, four years later, there's a new challenge in town: the ALS Pepper Challenge.\n\nLou Gehrig's disease, also known as ALS, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that worsens and weakens muscles in those who have the disease. While the research projects are underway from the Ice Bucket Challenge now, the family of a social worker, Patty Haberstroh, wanted to get the ball rolling on another awareness campaign and raise some money for ALS. Patty's family started a website and soon after, posted a video of them eating hot peppers for the #ALSPepperChallenge.\n\nSo far, $469,289 of $1,000,000 has been donated to their goal of raising money for ALS research. They'll continue running the campaign until their goal is met, but it's already bringing national attention to ALS again. In fact, the ALS Hot Pepper Challenge is hot on social media. So hot, actually, that quite a few celebrities have begun to take the challenge.\n\nHere's a list of the celebrities who've participated.\n\n1. Garth Brooks & Tricia Yearwood\n\n#ALSPepperChallenge Getting our #ALSPepperChallenge on! Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Kimmel , Kelly Clarkson & Jeff Mauro consider yourself challenged! love, g & T #StudioG Posted by Garth Brooks on Monday, January 29, 2018\n\nTrisha Yearwood bucked up and ate a habanero pepper while Garth looked on in amusement with his hot Dr Pepper. He donated to the cause, as well.\n\n2. Kelly Clarkson\n\n#ALSPepperChallenge Get ready Alicia Keys, Blake Shelton, and @OfficialAdamLevine for the #ALSPepperChallenge! Also, @BBlackstock I challenge you! #UrWelcomeFromYourLovingWife http://als.net/pepper Posted by Kelly Clarkson on Thursday, February 1, 2018\n\nOf course Kelly Clarkson would take the hot pepper challenge! However, after feeling intimidated by Tricia Yearwood grabbing that habanero, she knew that she, too, had to have a habanero. Hilarity for a good cause ensues.\n\n3. Jennifer Garner\n\nMe vs. pepper. Upshot: Not as cool as I thought I was. \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude0e#soyouthinkyoucanfarm #regretregretregret Posted by Jennifer Garner on Monday, January 22, 2018\n\nI have always loved Jennifer Garner, and her Pretend Cooking Show just makes me feel better about myself as a home cook, but this video solidified just how much I adore the down-to-earth movie star.\n\n4 and 5. Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal\n\nThe NBA hosts took the painful pepper challenge on air together, and poor Shaq looked like he was reevaluating his life decisions. Charles didn't fare too well either, as every bad decision he ever made looks like it flashed before his eyes on the second bite.\n\n6. Jimmy Kimmel\n\n\u201cTHANKS\u201d to Garth Brooks & Trisha Yearwood for challenging me to the #ALSPepperChallenge! I challenge CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper & Wolf Blitzer!! DONATE HERE: als.net/pepper #EndALS Posted by Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday, February 1, 2018\n\nJimmy Kimmel ate three peppers and got the hiccups. That sound about right...\n\n7. Jeff Mauro\n\nHere it is. In its entirety. @lorenzoluccamauro & doing the #ALSpepperChallenge. Sorry for the snot & song. I nominate @gzchef @sunnyanderson & @katieleekitchen oh....and @rochelletrotter. 1 HABANERO EACH. No ringers. #endALS als.net to donate Posted by Jeff Mauro on Tuesday, January 30, 2018\n\nThe Food Network star took the challenge along with his 8-year-old son and regret immediately set in.\n\nTrisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks certainly started a chain reaction. Now, news anchors and organizations across the country are heating hot peppers for ALS.
