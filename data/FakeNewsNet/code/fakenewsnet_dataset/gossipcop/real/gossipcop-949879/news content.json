Try to stick with one or two hours of TV a day at most. (Don't try to cut out TV entirely all at once, you'll probably fail and then you'll get frustrated with yourself.) Try to find new activities and hobbies that you like to do. You can read, learn a new language, learn how to make some new crafts, learn how to draw or play an instrument, etc.", "images": ["https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ef/Be-Proper-Step-12.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Be-Proper-Step-12.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/65/Wall-Mount-a-Plasma-TV-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Wall-Mount-a-Plasma-TV-Step-7-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6c/Exercise-While-Watching-TV-Step-14.jpg/-crop-127-140-127px-Exercise-While-Watching-TV-Step-14.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6c/Exercise-While-Watching-TV-Step-14.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Exercise-While-Watching-TV-Step-14.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/76/Overcome-Television-Addiction-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Overcome-Television-Addiction-Step-3-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Be-an-Effective-Supervisor-Step-3.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Be-an-Effective-Supervisor-Step-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Get-Cheap-Cable-Television-Step-6.jpg/-crop-127-140-127px-Get-Cheap-Cable-Television-Step-6.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2f/Treat-Depression-Naturally-Step-5.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Treat-Depression-Naturally-Step-5.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Get-Your-Children-Away-from-TV-Step-14.jpg/-crop-127-140-127px-Get-Your-Children-Away-from-TV-Step-14.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d1/Develop-Your-Own-Drawing-Style-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Develop-Your-Own-Drawing-Style-Step-4-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2d/Hook-Up-a-VCR-to-a-TV-Step-24.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Hook-Up-a-VCR-to-a-TV-Step-24.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/19/Stop-a-TV-Addiction-%28for-Kids%29-Step-17.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Stop-a-TV-Addiction-%28for-Kids%29-Step-17.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/ba/Get-Cheap-Cable-Television-Step-6.jpg/-crop-342-184-328px-Get-Cheap-Cable-Television-Step-6.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/88/Overcome-Television-Addiction-Step-18.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Overcome-Television-Addiction-Step-18.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f9/Get-Your-Children-Away-from-TV-Step-14.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Get-Your-Children-Away-from-TV-Step-14.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4d/Cope-With-Having-No-Friends-Step-30.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Cope-With-Having-No-Friends-Step-30.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/98/Have-Fun-when-You%27re-Bored-at-Home-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Have-Fun-when-You%27re-Bored-at-Home-Step-4-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/2f/Treat-Depression-Naturally-Step-5.jpg/-crop-127-140-127px-Treat-Depression-Naturally-Step-5.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/76/Turn-On-Your-TV-Step-3.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Turn-On-Your-TV-Step-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/f4/Write-a-Television-Show-Script-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Write-a-Television-Show-Script-Step-1-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4a/Connect-PC-to-TV-Wirelessly-Step-7.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Connect-PC-to-TV-Wirelessly-Step-7.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/skins/owl/images/wikihow_logo.png", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/9/98/Have-Fun-when-You're-Bored-at-Home-Step-4-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/03/Keep-Kids-Busy-with-No-TV-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Keep-Kids-Busy-with-No-TV-Step-1-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e4/Undo-Locks-Step-1.jpg/aid217983-v4-728px-Undo-Locks-Step-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/9/98/Have-Fun-when-You're-Bored-at-Home-Step-4-Version-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Wikihow Staff", "This Article Was Co-Authored Our Trained Team Of Editors", "Researchers Who Validated It For Accuracy", "Comprehensiveness.
