The spot, which aired during the Super Bowl LII broadcast, features Jeffrey Wright\u2019s Bernard Lowe, Thandie Newton\u2019s Maeve Millay, and Evan Rachel Wood\u2019s Dolores Abernathy \u2014 along with a peek at a frightening new host.\n\nThe spot begins almost like a commercial with the Westworld resort itself, with Dolores commenting in voice-over that \u201cWe built this world together... this world where dreams come true.\u201d But things soon turn dark as the spot looks inside the inner workings of the Delos offices, as men with guns take out a herd of synthetic creatures before being trampled themselves. It soon becomes that the hosts are not happy with the things they discovered in the first season of the show. \u201cWe can burn it to the ground,\u201d Dolores continues. \u201cFrom the ashes, build a new world. Our world.\u201d\n\nThe first season of Westworld played out like a complex, ever-evolving puzzle, using multiple timelines and narrative misdirection to evoke the same kind of is-this-real-or-is-this-a-dream experience that Westworld\u2019s hosts themselves dealt with. It\u2019s not clear whether the new season will adopt that same non-linear storytelling approach, but given the way the first season wrapped up, series creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy will have plenty of new areas to explore, regardless.\n\nHowever, not all of the footage in today\u2019s spot may end up in the series itself. According to Entertainment Weekly, the trailer \u2014 HBO\u2019s first Super Bowl commercial in 20 years \u2014 was directed by Jonathan Nolan, with some of the footage shot exclusively for the spot. Audiences will be able to find out just how much when the new season of Westworld premieres on HBO on April 22nd.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elXznSRpGJGgZ0ROD8J9GTOH6yU=/0x0:4050x2120/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155093/fb27d23e46db403e337225fb8f2b14fa19e8050eccc42ec930bacf7493daf51515c1ac9bc0a49860f3087ea902ac2c23.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elXznSRpGJGgZ0ROD8J9GTOH6yU=/0x0:4050x2120/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10155093/fb27d23e46db403e337225fb8f2b14fa19e8050eccc42ec930bacf7493daf51515c1ac9bc0a49860f3087ea902ac2c23.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Feb"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/4/16971782/westworld-season-2-trailer-watch-hbo-super-bowl-2018", "title": "Westworld\u2019s second season gets its first trailer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/verge", "published_time": "2018-02-04T21:11:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-04T21:11:08-05:00"}, "author": "Bryan Bishop", "style-tools": "https://www.theverge.com/style/community/372/6e15e9dd268c6af56a800c222c57d3d2/tools.css", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "HBO\u2019s Westworld wrapped up its first season with plenty of twists, surprises, and unanswered questions, and now the show\u2019s upcoming second season has just received its first formal trailer.
