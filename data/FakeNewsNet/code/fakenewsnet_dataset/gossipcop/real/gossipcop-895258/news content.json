Typically the roles were to play his wife or his girlfriend \u2014 leading roles for women were few and far between. Suddenly a very unusual script turned up. \"Now this is curious,\" I remember thinking. Because I'm a person of faith, the spiritual aspects got my attention. Also, the actress in me was delighted to read a show that had not one but two strong female roles - female angels. I was to audition for Monica and I very much liked Della Reese, who of course ended up playing Tess.[11] \u201d\n\nDowney has also spoken of her deep and lasting love for and friendship with Della Reese.[12] The two remained close until Reese's death on November 19, 2017.[13] She commented that Reese was \"such an influence on my life.
