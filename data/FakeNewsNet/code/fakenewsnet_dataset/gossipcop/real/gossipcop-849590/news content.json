First look at new Gavin and Stacey as cast start filming in Barry Island\n\n\"Lion was up for an Academy Award - a great, great film, beautiful film. And you got a lot of attention for the way you were clapping,\" Ellen said - ambushing Nicole with video of the moment.\n\nA clearly mortified Ms Kidman threw her hands over her head and exclaimed: \"Ellen!\"\n\n6 The A List star was left cringing after appearing on Ellen Credit: EllenTube\n\n6 Host Ellen DeGeneres demanded an explanation for the unusual moment Credit: EllenTube\n\n\"Well, I'm just... did you know ahead of time that you clapped in a different way?\" Ellen then asked.\n\nDenying she claps the way she was caught on camera, Nicole pleaded: \"I don't clap like that! I do not clap like that! That is a weird lens.\"\n\nEllen called her bluff, however, replying: \"The lens didn't do it to anybody else's fingers. How can you make any noise like that? You're not even really clapping.\"\n\n6 Nicole proved she can clap - even though she was wearing her own precious diamonds Credit: EllenTube\n\n6 Nicole was ridiculed after being caught out on camera at the 2017 Oscars Credit: A.M.P.A.S\n\nNicole then launched into her well rehearsed excuse - blaming the fine jewellery as the true reason she clapped with her hands bent backwards.\n\n\"Because I borrowed - it's the Cinderella thing - you borrow these expensive jewels and I'm like 'I must not damage these diamonds!' Cause I have to give them back at midnight and so I'm clapping!\" she explained.\n\n\"And they went back beautifully intact. Not a scratch on them. Keith is like 'Do not damage the diamonds!'\" she confirmed.\n\nHowever Ellen didn't appear to buy this response and pushed Nicole further.\n\n6 Nicole had been at the Oscars after being nominated for her role in Lion Credit: Getty Images\n\n\"Have you not owned real diamonds before?\" she asked - prompting Nicole to flash the diamonds on her hands.\n\nEllen then demanded: \"Lets see you clap right now. How do you clap?\"\n\nNicole then replied: \"I worked on it!\" and - to the sheer unadulterated delight of the live studio audience - clapped normally.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1.8 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tp-composite-nicole-kidman.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=752905198150451&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 0.7 1\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sunmasthead_mobile_site_of_the_year.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/sunmasthead_desktop_0404.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tp-composite-nicole-kidman.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Seamus Duff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3523089/nicole-kidman-proves-she-can-clap-normally-after-that-seal-like-oscar-mishap-had-the-internet-in-hysterics/", "title": "Nicole Kidman proves she can clap normally after THAT seal-like Oscar mishap had the internet in hysterics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "a576LGe3E0YA5QjAMY268jcuKWwPLIORxwlTMrjnfnE", "msvalidate.01": "E4359034FA254151A3AB2EFAC6D20D80", "p": {"domain_verify": "c061a8052bd9e93315b7f01447fa4124"}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Nicole Kidman proves she can clap normally after THAT seal-like Oscar mishap", "url": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3523089/nicole-kidman-proves-she-can-clap-normally-after-that-seal-like-oscar-mishap-had-the-internet-in-hysterics/", "description": "NICOLE Kidman proved she really can clap normally \u2013 after being mercilessly ridiculed for being caught applauding like a seal at the 2017 Oscars.
