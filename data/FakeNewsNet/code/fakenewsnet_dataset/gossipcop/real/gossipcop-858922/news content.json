The 23-year-old wrapped up the event with a heartfelt rendition of Judy Garland\u2019s 1939 classic \u201cSomewhere Over The Rainbow.\u201d Grande became overwhelmed during the performance and began to cry, pausing to pull herself together with the encouraging cheers of the 50,000-strong crowd behind her, before finishing the song, the Independent reported.\n\nGrande\u2019s mother, Joan, told Variety her daughter\u2019s connection to the song goes deeper than just Manchester. \u201cI didn\u2019t know she was going to sing it,\u201d the elder Grande said. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional story: my father passed away two and half years ago, and that was the song she sang for him after he passed.\u201d The singer was very close to her grandfather, who died in 2014. Her mother said he always encouraged her to sing the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d ballad in public.\n\nThe \"One Love\" concert was dedicated to the 22 victims who were killed by a suicide bomber after Grande\u2019s May 22 \u201cDangerous Woman\u201d tour performance wrapped up. Money raised went to British Red Cross\u2019s Manchester Emergency fund, which has raisedover \u00a39.6 million ($16.8 million) for the victims and their families. An online shop has also been set up for people to buy merchandise benefitting the cause. Security for the show was heightened after another terror attack took place in London less than 24 hours earlier, according to CNN. The \"One Love\" concert was dedicated to the 22 victims who were killed by a suicide bomber after Grande\u2019s May 22 \u201cDangerous Woman\u201d tour performance wrapped up. Grande and her manager, Scooter Braun, pulled the whole show together on short notice, while also making time to visit the victims and their families in hospital. She talked about meeting the mother of 15-year-old Olivia Campbell, who lost her life during the Manchester attack, during the show. \"As soon as I met her I started crying and I gave her a big hug and she said I should stop crying because Olivia would have wanted me to stop crying,\u201d Grande said. She added Campbell\u2019s mother told her that her daughter would\u2019ve \u201cwanted to hear the hits,\u201d so Grande listened, and rejigged her setlist to include some more upbeat songs like \u201cSide to Side.\u201d", "images":
