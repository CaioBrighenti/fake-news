It was so funny,\u201d Kardashian says. \u201cI feel like on social media lately everyone takes themselves so seriously, and I\u2019m over it.\u201d\n\nKardashian then asks about how Disick, 34, was doing while she was away.\n\n\u201cI think he was jealous,\u201d Jenner admits. \u201cBecause you were having fun, spending time with other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s really not fair,\u201d Kardashian fires back. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, I can\u2019t even live my life. I can\u2019t even go anywhere. He needs to get a f\u2014ing life and leave me alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll he does is try to make everybody else feel bad for him and try to make me look like the bad guy in the situation when clearly I\u2019m not, from 10 years of this going on,\u201d she adds.\n\nJenner points out that Kardashian might be \u201csad\u201d if Disick, with whom she shares three children, truly left her alone.\n\n\u201cYou always want what you can\u2019t have,\u201d warns Jenner. \u201cAnd when somebody is right there giving you their heart on a platter\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not!\u201d Kardashian interrupts. \u201cIf he was, that [would be] one thing. He\u2019s not. Mom, that\u2019s what he makes it seem to you, to Kim, to Khlo\u00e9, to the world, to everybody. He sits there and grovels and feels bad for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s his truth, why can\u2019t he get it together?\u201d she continues. \u201cI have to handle it when he\u2019s out photographed with a different hooker every day.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Inside Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s Wild Birthday Celebration \u2014 \u2018I May or May Not Have Thrown Up Four Times\u2019\n\nKardashian and Disick were together for nine years before she officially ended things in 2015. They share son Mason, 7, daughter Penelope, 4, and son Reign, 2.\n\nIn the two and a half years since, Disick has regularly been spotted cozying up to different women in Los Angeles, New York City and abroad \u2014 most recently with 19-year-old Sofia Richie, whom a source recently told PEOPLE is calling Disick her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d\n\nKardashian, meanwhile, has been dating 24-year-old Younes Bendjima \u2014 and in the KUWTK 10th anniversary special (which aired last month but was taped in April), she indicated that she and Disick aren\u2019t likely to reconcile.\n\n\u201cI guess we\u2019re co-parenting our kids and just trying to get along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s family. But I mean, we\u2019re definitely psychotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe debauchery that\u2019s gone on has definitely closed the door several billion times,\u201d she added. \u201cHe [behaves] for a time period, he can\u2019t be consistent.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Disick said. \u201cEvery time I become too good of a person, she stops loving me, because she fell in love with a person who was a little bit f\u2014ed up. I treat you like royalty, you don\u2019t say hello to me. I spit in your face, you\u2019re like, \u2018Hey babe.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she insisted.\n\nDisick also denied dating other people \u2014 with a wink, of course.\n\nBut according to Kardashian, she\u2019s okay with that: \u201cIt\u2019s not dating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, you know \u2026\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-slams-scott-disick-paparazzi-photos-with-hookers/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Slams Scott Disick for Being 'Photographed with a Different Hooker Every Day'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kourtney kardashian, scott disick, kourtney and scott, scott and kourtney, kuwtk, keeping up with the kardashians, scott disick dating, scott disick girlfriend, scott disick paparazzi, scott disick clubbing, scott disick girls", "news_keywords": "kourtney kardashian, scott disick, kourtney and scott, scott and kourtney, kuwtk, keeping up with the kardashians, scott disick dating, scott disick girlfriend, scott disick paparazzi, scott disick clubbing, scott disick girls", "description": "\"He needs to get a f\u2014ing life and leave me alone,\" Kourtney Kardashian says of her ex in Sunday's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians", "og": {"title": "Kourtney Kardashian Slams Scott Disick for Being 'Photographed with a Different Hooker Every Day'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-slams-scott-disick-paparazzi-photos-with-hookers/", "description": "\"He needs to get a f\u2014ing life and leave me alone,\" Kardashian says of her ex in an exclusive sneak peek at Sunday's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-slams-scott-disick-paparazzi-photos-with-hookers/", "description": "\"He needs to get a f\u2014ing life and leave me alone,\" Kourtney Kardashian says of her ex in Sunday's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-slams-scott-disick-paparazzi-photos-with-hookers/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Slams Scott Disick for Being 'Photographed with a Different Hooker Every Day'", "description": "\"He needs to get a f\u2014ing life and leave me alone,\" Kourtney Kardashian says of her ex in Sunday's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
