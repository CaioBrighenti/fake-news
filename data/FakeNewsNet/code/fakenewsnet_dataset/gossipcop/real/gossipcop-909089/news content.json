The 2018 Hollywood portfolio is here: https://t.co/6PfsFsPzK1 pic.twitter.com/MfRsp2y9Z3 \u2014 VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) January 25, 2018\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to The Kansas City Star content across all your devices. SAVE NOW\n\nOprah and Witherspoon made light of the gaffe.\n\nWell...I guess everybody knows now...I have 3 legs. I hope you can still accept me for who I am. ( and I will never apologize for snuggling @Oprah .. if you get the opportunity, I highly recommend it;) https://t.co/6GyrfWxNSY \u2014 Reese Witherspoon (@RWitherspoon) January 25, 2018 I accept your 3d leg. As I know you accept my 3d hand\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) January 25, 2018\n\nAnd many others chimed in about the oddity of the photos.\n\nBut it turns out, the photo of Witherspoon with three legs is an illusion, according to Vanity Fair. The lining of her dress resembles her legs, making it appear she has a third one.\n\nWhile we would have loved the exclusive on @RWitherspoon's three legs, unfortunately it's just the lining of her dress. https://t.co/HJjvbc037S \u2014 VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) January 25, 2018\n\nAs for Oprah\u2019s mysterious third hand, Vanity Fair fessed up to the error.\n\n\"YOU get a hand!
