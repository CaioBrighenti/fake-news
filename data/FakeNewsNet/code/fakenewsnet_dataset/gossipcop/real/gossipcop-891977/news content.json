The last time he played professionally was in 2013 for the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to announce that I will be playing in The Dubai International Basketball Championship this February 1st 2019 !!!!!!! \ud83c\udfc0I will be representing team @mightysports_ph from the Philippines with my 4ever #7 !\u201d he began the post on Instagram.\n\n\u201cTo me this is a great warming up for the @thebig3 !!\u201d he wrote, referencing the professional 3v3 basketball league that features mostly retired NBA players. \u201cIt\u2019s been a minute since I\u2019ve professionally competed and I hope to be as explosive as I used to be!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Lamar Odom Jim McIsaac/Getty\n\nRELATED: Lamar Odom Recalls Waking Up to Find Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian by His Side After Overdose: \u2018That Was Big\u2019\n\nOdom explained that his return came later than expected \u2014 he first announced his plans to move to China to play basketball professionally in July \u2014 due in part to his past medical crises, which included being in a coma for several days where he also experienced 12 strokes and six heart attacks.\n\n\u201cI was hoping to be ready for the Chinese CBA [Chinese Basketball Association] earlier this year but I didn\u2019t feel that I was physically w[h]ere I wanted to be. ( yet) I needed more time to recover from my multiple strokes and hearts attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nImage zoom Lamar Odom Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic\n\nDespite the setbacks, Odom reassured his fans that he was motivated and focused to get back to where he once was. \u201cIm not giving up and going in full force !! Patience and moving FORWARD is KEY!\u201d he added.\n\nWrapping up his post, Odom thanked his agents, kids, fans, former teammates and trainers, and manager for their support through the years and \u201cfor building the road to my comeback life chapter !

I had 12 strokes and six heart attacks when I was in a coma,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day, I\u2019m alive. It\u2019s much better than the alternative.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Lamar Odom Kevin Mazur/Getty\n\nIn December 2016 \u2014 more than a year after his near-fatal overdose and the same month his divorce from Kardashian was finalized \u2014 Odom checked into rehab with a plan to stay in the substance abuse program for 30 days.\n\nAfter completing his 30-day rehab stint in January, Odom was getting back into the swing of things, including focusing on his physical fitness. (He shared a pic to Instagram of himself working out with a personal trainer.)\n\nNearly a year after checking into rehab, however, Odom collapsed at a nightclub in Los Angeles in the early morning hours of Nov. 5, 2017. A rep for Odom told PEOPLE at the time that he was \u201cdoing well\u201d and simply \u201cdehydrated\u201d from an earlier workout.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Lamar Odom \u2018Is Spiraling Again\u2019 Following His Collapse, Says Source\n\nMonths later, in April 2018, Odom revealed that he had, indeed, been facing another fight with his addiction to crack-cocaine but that he found a surprising source of relief: marijuana. As a result, he decided to open up his own cannabis business.\n\nBut Odom\u2019s substance abuse seemed to be behind him for good when he announced over the summer that he was accepting a new management deal with the 90 Plus Group that would relocate him to Shenzhen, China.\n\nIn the since-deleted post, Odom wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step for me and I feel so happy to be writing new episodes of my life in another country that\u2019s so HUGE in basketball.\u201d Odom had previously been spotted on the merchandising and intellectual property brand\u2019s social media feed weeks before his announcement.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/boy-with-frog-walker.jpg?crop=0px%2C206px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630",
