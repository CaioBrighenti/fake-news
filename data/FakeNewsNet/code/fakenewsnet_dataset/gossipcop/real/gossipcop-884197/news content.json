I still don\u2019t know what to say but wanted to let everyone know that me and my crew are safe. My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.\u201d\n\nHe added the hashtags #heartbroken and #stopthehate.\n\nAldean has two children and his wife is pregnant with their third.\n\nRUSSELL BRAND LASHES OUT\n\nThe comments come after Russell Brand has blasted American gun laws and \u201cnormalised\u201d mass shootings in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting tragedy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that America\u2019s ideas about freedom to purchase arms continues to hold the imagination so strongly even after Sandy Hook,\u201d Brand said, in a video he posted online today from the United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of tragic that as I\u2019m looking at this, I\u2019m not thinking, \u2018What?! Fifty people have died?!\u2019 Instead, it\u2019s like \u2018one of those things has happened.\u2019 It is already normalised by virtue of the fact it happens a lot.\u201d\n\nThe British comedian \u2014 who cancelled a scheduled TV appearance to promote his new book on the US Today show following the tragedy \u2014 also debated what drove the violence.\n\n\u201cWhat is it that\u2019s bubbling up from under the surface in the form of violence of this kind?,\u201d Brand said, in the video posted on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cI would argue that it\u2019s extreme unhappiness, extreme darkness, an unaddressed darkness.\n\n\u201cThis social phenomena occurring this regularly and our ability to see it as kind of normal is an indication that we need to address the root cause, and the root cause is always the consciousness of human beings on an individual and social level.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t stop happening unless we change our mentality.\u201d\n\nMARIAH BLINDSIDED IN SHOCK INTERVIEW\n\nFurious Good Morning Britain viewers have slammed the show\u2019s \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d interview with Mariah Carey as \u201ctasteless\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d after the star was put on the spot about the horror shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nThe Hero singer was due to chat to presenters Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid about her new tour, and was perched on her sofa alongside her huge Christmas tree.\n\nYet the angle of their interview switched when news of the Las Vegas massacre broke, with Mariah unaware of the shooting.\n\nAhead of their chat, Piers, 52, explained Mariah knew the city \u201cvery well\u201d after recently rounding off her music residency in the gambling hotspot.\n\nHe asked her about her instant reaction.
