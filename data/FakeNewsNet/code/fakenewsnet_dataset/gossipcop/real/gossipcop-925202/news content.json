Alcohol just stopped working for me,\u201d she says.\n\nAs the holidays drew near, the reality star, who was previously married to Count Alexandre de Lesseps \u2014 with whom she shares two children, son Noel and daughter Victoria \u2014 decided to celebrate in Palm Beach, a somewhat dubious choice given it was the location of her wedding just one year earlier.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t put my finger on why I was feeling so anxious and why I was drinking more,\u201d de Lesseps says of returning to the scene of her failed nuptials. \u201cIt makes sense now.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 23, she was arrested for disorderly intoxication after she ended up in the wrong hotel room at the Colony Hotel and clashed with officers who arrived on the scene. She was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant; she\u2019s due in court April 13 and faces possible jail time if convicted.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Luann de Lesseps Brings PEOPLE Inside Her \u2018Eclectic\u2019 Kitchen\n\nFollowing her arrest, de Lesseps entered a treatment facility and began focusing on her personal well-being. Since her time in rehab, de Lesseps has turned a new leaf: She hasn\u2019t resumed drinking, and has also given up smoking, lost 8 lbs. and gotten into yoga and meditation.\n\nFor more on Luann de Lesseps, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on stands Friday\n\nImage zoom\n\nShe\u2019s also resumed filming of RHONY: \u201cI was so happy to come back to my work, to come back to my life,\u201d she says.\n\nFor the indefinite future, De Lesseps is choosing to refrain from drinking alcohol \u2014 but she\u2019s taking things day by day.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Will I drink again? I don\u2019t know. I miss good red wine. Not to say that I\u2019ll never have good red wine again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho knows where we\u2019ll all be tomorrow,\u201d she adds. \u201cFor today, that\u2019s the choice that I\u2019m making for myself.\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps will appear on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Wednesday at 11 p.m. ET, and The Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/countessluann-jovani-feelinjovani-02990-front.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3253px%2C1707.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/luanndelessepsclip.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2864px%2C1503.6px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/meghanharrycover.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/luann-de-lesseps.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/bethenny-frankel1.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C1363px%2C715px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/barbara.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/beth-chapman-dog-bounty-hunter-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gettyimages-960850746.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rhony-luann-ramona.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-27-at-4.36.50-pm.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2858px%2C1500.45px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jessica-mcdonald-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/long-luanne.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1285px%2C674.625px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/luanne-bethenny.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screen-shot-2019-07-11-at-9.47.46-am.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/bethenny-luann.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/rhonysplit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/luanne.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rhony-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rhony.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/luann-delessps.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1292px%2C678.3px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/luann3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/image1-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/amber-portwood-boyfriend-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C722px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/long-luanne.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1285px%2C674.625px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Wakeford", "Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/luann-de-lesseps-drank-7-drinks-a-day/", "title": "Luann de Lesseps Drank 7 Drinks a Day Before Her Arrest", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Alcoholism,Exclusive,Luann de Lesseps,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New York City,Rehab,Rollout,TV", "news_keywords": "Alcoholism,Exclusive,Luann de Lesseps,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New York City,Rehab,Rollout,TV", "description": "\"I couldn't continue living the way that I was living \u2014 the only place where I felt like I was going to be okay was rehab,\" Luann de Lesseps tells PEOPLE of her decision to enter a treatment facility", "og": {"title": "Luann de Lesseps Drank 7 Drinks a Day Before Her Arrest and Has Lost 8 Lbs.
