I\u2019ve done nothing wrong and you are handcuffing me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you! I will kill you!\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps explained her bizarre trouble with the law on The Dr. Oz Show, admitting it started with too much wine.\n\n\u201cI had ros\u00e9 at lunch, with my girlfriend, we split a bottle of Whispering Angel, which is normal. And then there were some people there that were fans, so they send me more ros\u00e9. So I drank more than I usually would.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cSo, by the time I get to the Colony [Hotel, where her arrest happened], I was pretty sloshed and then I don\u2019t know. I almost think that somebody slipped me something, because I don\u2019t remember a thing after that.\u201d\n\nThe TV countess also told Us Weekly, \u201cWhen you can\u2019t react properly in front of a police officer, then you\u2019ve got a problem. And I did something about it. Not many people get that window into looking at themselves. I\u2019m grateful for it.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?
