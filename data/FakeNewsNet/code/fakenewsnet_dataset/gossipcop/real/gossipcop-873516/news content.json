Obviously, he's probably doing them at his house, you know? I mean, hopefully, his parents were doing their supervision...so that she didn't see much.\"\n\nWhen quizzed about how long he had been battling a drug addiction, Chelsea told the producer, \"I've heard about it for a long time.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old MTV star informed producers that, \"He was not on drugs when I was with him or knew him.\"\n\n\"But that's the thing is I can't picture it\u2014it's just crazy to think that this person is doing that. It makes me sad for Aubree. The last thing you want to give your child is a drug-addicted father.\"\n\nHouska also shares a second child with her husband Cole DeBoer.", "images": ["https://www.who.com.au/Branding/who/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/Who/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/Who/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BXG9OmqBas2/media/?size=l", "https://www.who.com.au/media/40141/who_2619_cover_bws.png?height=158", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BWlPwLrhWQ5/media/?size=l", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/Who/images/brand-logo-mobile-menu-colored.svg", "https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.who.com.au/media/11896/teen-mom-chelsea.jpg", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/who/images/gmail.svg", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/Who/images/brand-logo-nav.svg", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/who/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/who/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.who.com.au/media/11896/teen-mom-chelsea.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.who.com.au/teen-mom-2s-chelsea-houska-reveals-she-doesnt-want-her-daughter-to-spend-time-with-her-father", "title": "Teen Mom 2's Chelsea Houska reveals she doesn't want her daughter to spend time with her father", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "In a recent episode of Teen Mom 2, Chelsea Houska gets candid about a problem that's been playing on her mind of late.", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.who.com.au/teen-mom-2s-chelsea-houska-reveals-she-doesnt-want-her-daughter-to-spend-time-with-her-father", "title": "Teen Mom 2's Chelsea Houska reveals she doesn't want her daughter to spend time with her father", "description": "In a recent episode of Teen Mom 2, Chelsea Houska gets candid about a problem that's been playing on her mind of late.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.who.com.au/media/11896/teen-mom-chelsea.jpg", "width": 1020, "height": 680}}, "twitter": {"title": "Teen Mom 2's Chelsea Houska reveals she doesn't want her daughter to spend time with her father", "description": "In a recent episode of Teen Mom 2, Chelsea Houska gets candid about a problem that's been playing on her mind of late.", "image": "http://www.who.com.au/media/11896/teen-mom-chelsea.jpg", "url": "https://www.who.com.au/teen-mom-2s-chelsea-houska-reveals-she-doesnt-want-her-daughter-to-spend-time-with-her-father"}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 28734051211}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502781030.053, "source": "https://www.who.com.au", "summary": ""}
