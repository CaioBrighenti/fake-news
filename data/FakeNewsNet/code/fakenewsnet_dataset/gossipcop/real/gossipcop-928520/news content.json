Little did they know, things were about to get a whole lot worse.\n\n\u201cMoments like this make you realize and remember that we\u2019ve been through so much stuff together, ups and downs,\u201d Ronnie said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen each other at our best moments and we\u2019ve seen each other at our worst moments. It\u2019s definitely good to have the guys around to help me keep my mind off things. Just the fact that they\u2019re here and they want to be here means a lot to me. It shows that we are real brothers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next for me is that I\u2019m going to go spend time with my daughter and take the next steps to get all my ducks in a row,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have to become a better me \u2014 for myself, for the baby, for my future.\u201d\n\nAnd while supportive, the guys were apprehensive about leaving their friend behind as they prepared to head home. (Ronnie and Pauly \u201cDJ Pauly D\u201d DelVecchio live in Vegas, but the rest of the cast lives on the East Coast.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned about leaving Ron,\u201d admitted Vinny Guadagnino. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that happens overnight, where someone just becomes magically better, but we did our best setting him up with the tools that he needed to succeed. He has a lawyer now, so he has a good support system around him. We can just hope for the best.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jen Harley/Instagram\n\nOne thing they certainly weren\u2019t hoping for? A reconciliation between the volatile couple \u2014 but somehow, that\u2019s exactly what happened. And when Ronnie revealed to Pauly that he and Jen had gotten back together, Pauly was shocked.\n\n\u201cHere we go again,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe he\u2019s still talking to this woman. She\u2019s toxic. I want to support Ronnie, but this is crazy. I do not think Ron and Jen should ever get back together.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jersey Shore Cast Gave Ronnie \u2018Tough Love\u2019 During Drama with On-Off Girlfriend: \u2018It Was Hard\u2019\n\nBack in Jersey, the cast got together to surprise Deena Cortese, who\u2019s expecting her first child, for lunch. The topic quickly turned to Ronnie, who wasn\u2019t there, and Pauly caught everyone up on the latest. Needless to say, they weren\u2019t pleased.\n\n\u201cI am unfortunately not surprised,\u201d Vinny said. \u201cRonnie tends to make bad decisions in relationships. It just sucks because we all know he shouldn\u2019t be with her.\u201d\n\nJenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley called the reconciliation \u201cunbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give advice, but if there\u2019s anything that I could say to Ron and Jen, it\u2019s keep that s\u2014 out of the public eye,\u201d she said. \u201cDeal with it inside your house.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you have your girlfriends and you give advice and they still stay with the guy and you\u2019re like, \u2018Now this is going to ruin our relationship, so just don\u2019t tell me about it\u2019 \u2014 I feel like that\u2019s how it should be now,\u201d Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi said.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jersey Shore\u2018s\u2019 Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Apologizes After Public Feud with Girlfriend: \u2018I Acted on My Gut\u2019\n\nBut the show must go on, so they decided to plan a trip to the original shore house back in Seaside Heights. A week later, everyone packed up their bags and headed out. The only one who didn\u2019t make it? Ronnie, who got into an even worse altercation with Harley the day before the trip. On June 24, Harley was arrested and charged with domestic battery after an incident in which it was alleged that she briefly dragged Ronnie with her car while their infant daughter was in the backseat.\n\nImage zoom LVMPD/Splash News\n\nShe was released from the Clark County Detention Center the following day after posting the $3,000 bail; the Clark County District Attorney\u2019s Office later confirmed to PEOPLE that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to prosecute her. And when they heard the news, the roommates could hardly believe it.\n\n\u201cThe relationship is toxic,\u201d Vinny said. \u201cIt\u2019s insane staying in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHomeboy is destroyed right now,\u201d Jenni said. \u201cHe texted me yesterday [saying] he\u2019s at urgent care.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiterally, flesh was coming out of his arm. It was not okay,\u201d said Nicole, while Deena added that Ronnie\u2019s face was \u201call f\u2014ed up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t want him to come,\u201d Jenni admitted. \u201cI really don\u2019t, because I want him with his baby. Between her jumping a median with the f\u2014ing baby in the car, she dragged Ron with the car, he\u2019s in a f\u2014ing sling and is covered in blood \u2014 like, done. Not speaking to her, and I\u2019m going to keep it very light and sweet with Ron, because this s\u2014 is too crazy.\u201d\n\nOnce the cast reunited at the house, Ronnie FaceTimed in from Vegas with his arm in a sling. And even though they were disappointed he wasn\u2019t there, the roommates just wanted him to focus on himself.\n\n\u201cHe just needs to sit this one out, work on himself,\u201d Vinny said. \u201cHopefully, this was a huge wake-up call for him and he can just figure it out on his own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love, love, love Ron,\u201d Jenni said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, one of those crazy cousins or brothers or sisters that you have that you wish just made better life choices.\u201d\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays (8 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images":
