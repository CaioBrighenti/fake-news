He is completely besotted and nothing would make him happier if they were starting a family,\" the source says.\n\nIn a March interview with ET, royal expert Katie Nicholl said, \"My sources are saying that Prince Harry, particularly, is very keen to start a family, pretty soon after the royal wedding. He's made no secret about wanting children.\"\n\n\"Meghan is very doting with children,\" Nicholl continued. \"She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things, anecdotes that I discovered [while writing my book] was, it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry.\"\n\nThe couple also opened up about starting a family during their first joint interview together after their engagement last year. \"I think eventually, one step at a time, and we\u2019ll start a family in the near future,\" they said.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMeghan Markle Goes Bold in Blue at Military Charity Gala With Prince Harry\n\nPrince Harry Gives Sweet Shout Out to Meghan Markle During 2018 WellChild Awards Speech\n\nHow Meghan Markle Is a 'Great Comfort' for Prince Harry on Anniversary of Princess Diana's Death\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1026730856.jpg?itok=pO9K9jJL", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2019-06/gettyimages-1152799403.jpg?itok=zUN6_gcg&h=68fe9b90", "https://www.etonline.com/modules/contrib/ctd_uvp/img/placeholder.gif", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161760651.jpg?itok=MLRyG4zA&h=bd7808dd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x169/public/images/2018-08/meghan.jpg?itok=eMxYlJFB&h=82971f7c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-05/amazon-prime-day-beauty-sales-1280.jpg?itok=FIL40h13&h=f7474839"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1026730856.jpg?itok=pO9K9jJL", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-eager-to-start-a-family-source-says-109237", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Are 'Eager to Start a Family,' Source Says", "meta_data": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Are 'Eager to Start a Family,' Source Says  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-eager-to-start-a-family-source-says-109237", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 'Eager to Start a Family,' Source Says", "description": "ET's source says that while the couple is focused on their charitable interests right now, they can't wait to have kids.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1026730856.jpg?itok=pO9K9jJL", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "ET's source says that while the couple is focused on their charitable interests right now, they can't wait to have kids.", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 'Eager to Start a Family,' Source Says", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-eager-to-start-a-family-source-says-109237", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1026730856.jpg?itok=pO9K9jJL"}, "description": "ET's source says that while the couple is focused on their charitable interests right now, they can't wait to have kids.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Babies & Kids", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Babies & Kids"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
