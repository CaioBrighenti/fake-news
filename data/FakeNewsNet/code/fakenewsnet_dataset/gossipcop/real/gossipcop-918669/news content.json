News the excursion was arranged for Stefani to meet with venue bosses and work out a residency deal.\n\n\u201cHer visit to Las Vegas this weekend was one of the final pieces of the puzzle,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cThings are looking very good.\u201d\n\nStefani is said to be \u201cvery close\u201d to finalizing a contract, seemingly taking over from J.Lo, who will take her final bow at Planet Hollywood\u2019s Zappos Theatre, formerly known as The AXIS, in September.\n\nThe family-friendly nature of the big gig is reportedly what drew Gwen to the idea as she shares three sons with her ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale.\n\n\u201cThis is about spending more time with her kids,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to go back out on a big tour again and be away from her kids for six months at a time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s flexibility that comes with doing a residency. She\u2019ll be able to come in and out of Las Vegas for a couple weeks at a time throughout the year and she\u2019ll never be too far from home.\u201d\n\nRumours also suggest Stefani may reunite with her No Doubt bandmates for the Vegas shows, two years after they last teamed up onstage.\n\nThe insider adds: \u201cIt\u2019s possible the residency could be billed as Gwen Stefani With No Doubt, serving as somewhat of a reunion for the band. Details are still being worked out with the rest of the band, but either way Gwen will definitely be singing No Doubt songs.\u201d\n\nThe singer has yet to comment on the news, but if she does join the Sin City circuit, she will be in good company \u2013 Lady Gaga will kick off her own residency at the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino\u2019s Park Theater in December, while the Backstreet Boys, Celine Dion, and Elton John also have regular shows in Vegas.\n\nStefani, who is currently dating country star Blake Shelton, documented her Vegas visit on Instagram on Saturday night, and later shared a snap of herself and Jennifer backstage.\n\n\u201c@jlo your Vegas show was so good!,\u201d she captioned the picture, adding the telling hashtag, \u201c#inspired.\u201d", "images": ["https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/bluesfest-thursday-046-jpg.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=150", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0603-biz-wire-walmart-e1520442765916.jpg", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/postmedia-theme-broadsheet/images/common/logo-postmedia.png", "https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/story-slug2.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=150", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAQAAAAe/WZNAAAADklEQVR42mNkgAJGDAYAAFEABCaLYqoAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://postmediacalgaryherald2.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ch_300x300_rgb.png?resize=120,120"], "top_img": "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/0603-biz-wire-walmart-e1520442765916.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Updated", "February"], "canonical_link": "https://canoe.com/entertainment/music/gwen-stefani-gets-las-vegas-residency-deal-report", "title": "Gwen Stefani gets Las Vegas residency deal: Report", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "915AE10930FFCE1EFBB9D7838CE66DE7", "description": "Gwen Stefani is reportedly ready to set up a second home in Las Vegas for a concert residency.The Rich Girl hitmaker took a weekend trip to Sin City to check out Jennifer Lopez\u2019s long-running All I Have show at the Planet Hollywood resort and casino, and now sources tell E!
