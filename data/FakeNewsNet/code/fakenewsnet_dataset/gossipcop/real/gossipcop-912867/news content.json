In the five-minute \"making of\" clip, the two friends discuss their recent collaboration and how Sheeran knew \"exactly what to do\" when she played the track for the first time.\n\n\"I was in a hotel room in New York in bed about 8 o'clock in the morning and I woke up because for some reason I'd dreamed it in my head what I was going to do,\" he explained, with Swift jokingly quipping, \"So it's not talent, it accidentally happened to you.\"\n\nNewly-engaged Sheeran also recounted how his relationship began with his fianc\u00e9, Cherry Seaborn, whom he invited to one of Swift's Fourth of July parties at her home.\n\n\"There\u2019s a film with Tom Cruise called Born on the Fourth of July. My relationship started on the Fourth of July,\" Sheeran explained.\n\n\u201cAt whose house?\u201d asked Swift.\n\n\u201cAt Taylor\u2019s house. So the story was, I was at Taylor\u2019s party, and then a girl I went to school with who\u2019s pretty cool ended up being in Rhode Island,\" he continued. \"I was like, \u2018Taylor, can she turn up?\u2019 And here we are.\u201d\n\n\"End Game\" made fans instantly think of Swift's previous celebrity feuds with Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and Katy Perry. In the Reputation song, Swift sings, \"Big reputation, big reputation/Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ah/And you heard about me, ooh/I got some big enemies.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kardashian recently sent her Valentine's Day perfume to her friends and \"haters,\" which included Swift.\n\nWatch the video below to see what Kardashian said in the message.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nTaylor Swift Playfully Accuses Ed Sheeran of 'Peacocking' In New Instagram Video\n\nKim Kardashian Sends Taylor Swift, Blac Chyna and More 'Haters' Her Valentine's Day Perfume\n\nWATCH: 'End Game' Music Video: Taylor Swift Is Living Her Best Life With Ed Sheeran and Future -- Watch!\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/modules/contrib/ctd_uvp/img/placeholder.gif", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161760651.jpg?itok=MLRyG4zA&h=bd7808dd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_ed_sheeran_taylor_swift_getty_020718.jpg?itok=4C27G-Yx", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/street-style-outfit-nordstrom-anniversary-sale-1280.jpg?itok=eyAT2Bws&h=e6a33408", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-05/swift_getty956298740.jpg?itok=CNOB74we&h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_ed_sheeran_taylor_swift_getty_020718.jpg?itok=4C27G-Yx", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-treats-fans-to-behind-the-scenes-end-game-video-with-ed-sheeran-96169", "title": "Taylor Swift Treats Fans to Behind-the-Scenes 'End Game' Video With Ed Sheeran", "meta_data": {"title": "Taylor Swift Treats Fans to Behind-the-Scenes 'End Game' Video With Ed Sheeran | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-treats-fans-to-behind-the-scenes-end-game-video-with-ed-sheeran-96169", "title": "Taylor Swift Treats Fans to Behind-the-Scenes 'End Game' Video With Ed Sheeran", "description": "The 27-year-old singer gives an inside look at the making of her latest single.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_ed_sheeran_taylor_swift_getty_020718.jpg?itok=4C27G-Yx", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 27-year-old singer gives an inside look at the making of her latest single.", "title": "Taylor Swift Treats Fans to Behind-the-Scenes 'End Game' Video With Ed Sheeran", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Liz Calvario\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-treats-fans-to-behind-the-scenes-end-game-video-with-ed-sheeran-96169", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_ed_sheeran_taylor_swift_getty_020718.jpg?itok=4C27G-Yx"}, "description": "The 27-year-old singer gives an inside look at the making of her latest single.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, Music, News, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, Music, News, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/VA7Y_Psp5l4?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
