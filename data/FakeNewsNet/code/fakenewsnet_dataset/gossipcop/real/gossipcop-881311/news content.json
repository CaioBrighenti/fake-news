Fox Searchlight\n\nIt took more than Hollywood magic to turn Emma Stone, the svelte actress from La La Land, into Billie Jean King in her new movie Battle of the Sexes.\n\nFor starters, the physical transformation required three months, 15 pounds and a meal and fitness plan.\n\nTrainer Jason Walsh, founder of climbing gym Rise Nation, who got Stone in shape for La La Land, knew the actress would need to up her calorie intake and strength training regimen to embody the powerful tennis legend.\n\nHere's what Stone went through to reshape her body.\n\nFor her role in 'Battle of the Sexes,' Emma Stone gained 15 pounds. (Photo: Melinda Sue Gordon, 20th Century Fox Film)\n\nShe wasn\u2019t afraid of packing on pounds.\n\nStone is \u201cvery petite and has a dancer's body,\u201d but she was willing to bulk up to look more like King. \u201cShe took it seriously,\" Walsh says. \"She wanted to do the story justice.\u201d\n\nGaining a dozen-plus pounds of muscle made Stone look more like a tennis pro, and also feel more like her character. \u201cWe wanted to give Emma the psychological backing\u201d to be able to compete in professional tennis matches, Walsh says. \u201cShe needed to be resilient and to have the psyche of being really strong.\u201d\n\nEmma Stone, here with co-star Ryan Gosling, had a lithe look for 'La La Land.' (Photo: Dale Robinette)\n\nShe drank two high-cal protein shakes a day.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we were taking someone off the Taco Bell diet,\u201d Walsh says of his clean-eating client, \u201cbut we added shakes into her diet.\" The shakes had \u201chundreds of calories\u201d each, he says, and usually contained a handful of spinach, a supplement known as ashwagandha and a \u201cgood tasting\" protein powder. Fortunately, since Stone was working out so much (twice a day), she was hungry enough to down the filling beverages.\n\nEmma Stone getting her deadlift on. Ladies, DEADLIFT!!!! This lift will change your life. #Strongisthenewsexy #strong #motivated A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 21, 2015 at 7:54am PDT\n\nShe lifted an impressive amount of weight.\n\nSome of Walsh\u2019s daily go-to strength training exercises for Stone? Pushing and pulling sleds twice her size, heavy farmer\u2019s walks (aka walking while holding dumbbells) and up to 300-pound hip thrusts. At one point, Stone was deadlifting 185 pounds and doing push-ups with 50 pounds of chains on her back.\n\n\u201cI was pretty proud,\u201d Walsh says.\n\nThe \"Battle of the Sexes\" Working with Emma is pure hell...we loathe each other #battleofthesexes #emmastone A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 22, 2017 at 6:34pm PDT\n\nThen she backed off.\n\nWhile Stone was gaining weight, she stayed away from fat-burning cardio. But once she achieved the right look for the film, \u201cwe started adding conditioning aspects,\u201d Walsh says. That meant Stone was lifting fewer weights and doing cardio at Rise Nation once or twice a week.\n\nShe's two years beyond her most intensive Battle of the Sexes training, but Walsh encourages the actress, and anyone else trying to stay in shape, to mix activities like yoga and hiking with strength training.\n\nYes, for women. And, yes, that means lifting weights.\n\n\u201cI train (GLOW star) Alison Brie and (future Captain Marvel) Brie Larson, and all of these girls are strong as hell and not big,\u201d he says. In fact, after incorporating weight-lifting into their workout routine, \u201cThey fit into their clothes better (and) are three, four, five times stronger than before.\u201d\n\nWant to see the results of Stone's hard work? Battle of the Sexes is in theaters now in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, San Francisco and Washington. It expands nationwide Friday.\n\nEmma Stone, with co-star Steve Carrell, looked and felt very strong playing real-life tennis legend Billie Jean King.
