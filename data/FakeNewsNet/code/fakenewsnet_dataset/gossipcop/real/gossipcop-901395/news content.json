They\u2019ve done everything from posing in glamorous gowns on the stairs in 2010 to testing out a 3D version in 2011 and even a chaotic carnival in 2013.\n\nBut in 2015, after a tumultuous year, the Kardashian-Jenners decided to go back to basics and settled on a sweet, simple photo of the youngest family members set against a plain white backdrop. The family opted to not release a card in 2016.\n\nThis year, the KKW Beauty entrepreneur took on the role of organizing the Christmas card shoot \u2014 which which was captured by photographer Eli Linnetz.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s Christmas card is shot really casually.
