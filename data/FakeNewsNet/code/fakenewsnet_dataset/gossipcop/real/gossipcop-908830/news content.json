It is another offering from of her brand of female empowerment, in which she leads the \"Aute Cuture\u2014a 'mystic beauty gang,' as the press release explains.\n\n\"Aute Cuture is the title: written incorrectly but with a sense of humor and strength. I wrote this song before going out to tour El Mal Querer and I have taken the time necessary so the song would come out with the best video to accompany it. Filled with claps, nail art, and a Tarantino vibe. Enjoy it and hopefully it'll make you dance and laugh like it does me,\" Rosal\u00eda wrote in the release.\n\nMA\u00d1ANAAA AUTE CUTURE Y 1 A\u00d1O DE MALAMENTEpic.twitter.com/v51nlWkyR1 \u2014 R O S A L \u00cd A (@rosaliavt) May 29, 2019\n\nIn anticipation of the new track, Rosal\u00eda recently shared a note on Twitter celebrating the amazing year she's had since releasing her breakout track \"Malamente\" as the lead single to her critically acclaimed El Mal Querer.\n\nShe wrote (translated from Spanish); \"A year ago today I released 'Malamente.' A year ago today my live changed with this song that allowed me to connect to many people.\" The song earned her two Latin GRAMMY wins in 2018, where she shouted out the bold women in music that came before her during her acceptance speech.\n\nThe song is the second non-album single she has released since El Mal Querer. It follows the classic reggaeton inspired track, \"Con Altura,\" which she released late March with fellow Latin GRAMMY winner J Balvin. That single and mile-high-set music video, also featured El Guincho, who co-produces the majority of Rosal\u00eda's music with her (including on El Mal Querer and the new \"Aute Cuture\"). She was also featured on James Blake's latest album, on the beautifully weird \"Barefoot in the Park.\"\n\nHow Rosal\u00eda Is Reinventing What It Means To Be A Global Pop Star", "images":
