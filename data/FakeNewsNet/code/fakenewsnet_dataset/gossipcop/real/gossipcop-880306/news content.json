She will always have the right to go back into court if further incidents of domestic abuse occur.\u201d\n\nStill, Bloom says \u201cthis agreement does not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.\u201d\n\nKardashian and Chyna\u2019s roller coaster relationship began in January 2016, when the two went public with their romance. The pairing initially raised eyebrows due to Chyna\u2019s complicated history with the Kardashian-Jenner family: She shares a son with Kardashian\u2019s sister Kylie Jenner\u2018s former boyfriend Tyga and is best friends with Amber Rose, an ex of Kanye West, who is now married to Kim Kardashian West.\n\nImage zoom Prince Williams/WireImage\n\nThe two feuded on social media throughout their relationship, but the tension reached its peak on July 5, when Kardashian repeatedly shared graphic and expletive-ridden content about his ex \u2014 including three naked photos \u2014 while accusing her of drug use, alcohol abuse and infidelity.\n\nChyna and her legal team accused him of violating California\u2019s revenge porn laws, claiming in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that Kardashian allegedly hit her and threatened to kill himself multiple times. A judge later granted her a set of restraining orders against Kardashian.\n\nFROM PEN: Blac Chyna Recalls the Shocking Moment Rob Kardashian Uploaded Her Most Intimate Photos Online\n\nEarlier this week, a source told PEOPLE that Kardashian was \u201clistening to advice from his family and instructions from his lawyer to behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone wants him to be quiet and not get into any more trouble,\u201d said the source, adding that Kardashian \u2014 who has long struggled with his weight and depression \u2014 \u201cisn\u2019t healthy, and isn\u2019t making huge efforts to get healthier, but he does really care about Dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loves spending time with her,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe always misses Dream when she is with Chyna.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive sit-down with PEOPLE in July, Chyna insisted she\u2019s committed to co-parenting her daughter with her ex.\n\n\u201cI feel that the key to successful co-parenting is communication and respect,\u201d she said. \u201cI might have one point of view, but hopefully Dream and King\u2019s fathers add theirs, and we can come together to build better people. I know right and wrong. I\u2019m pretty sure they know right and wrong. We\u2019re going to do the best we can.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3fa541db8026dac32c501e873a116a3c?s=300&d=blank&r=g",
