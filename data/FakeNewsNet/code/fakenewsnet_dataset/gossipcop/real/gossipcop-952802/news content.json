That\u2019s how Desiree Hartsock feels about her second pregnancy with Chris Siegfried. \u201cWe both felt joy,\u201d the mom due in January says exclusively in the new issue of Us Weekly.\n\nBut there\u2019s a twist. \u201cI wasn\u2019t working during the first pregnancy,\u201d the bridal gown designer, 32, says. This time she\u2019s one step ahead, working on her bridal designs ahead of time as she awaits baby: \u201cI\u2019ve been putting in the work.\u201d\n\nAnd with 20-month-old Asher around (\u201cHe\u2019s a full-blown toddler!\u201d), Hartsock is preparing for what\u2019s ahead with the help of her husband of three years. \u201cI\u2019ve jumped back into it,\u201d the dad, also 32, chimes in. \u201cI cook and let Des relax as much as she can.\u201d Some of her current cravings: \u201cItalian sandwiches and vinegar,\u201d she says.\n\nHartsock is also preparing Asher for a new sibling. \u201cWe\u2019ll say, \u2018Where\u2019s the baby?\u2019 the Bachelorette alum says. \u201cAnd he\u2019ll point to my stomach, but I still don\u2019t think he understands, but he\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\nThough in terms of \u201cbaby stuff,\u201d Hartsock says she is ready: \u201cWe know what to expect. When we brought Asher home, we were so cautious and scared.\u201d\n\nAnd as for another baby in the future, the couple are uncertain: \u201cI think that\u2019s a bridge we have to cross after this one,\u201d she says. \u201cWe might be OK at two, but you need an army with more kids!\u201d\n\nFor more on Hartsock\u2019s baby joy, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 on stands now and listen to Us break down the biggest stories in the magazine subscribe to our new podcast \u201cIn Case You Missed Us.\u201d\n\nReporting by Travis Cronin\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hartstock1.jpg?w=195", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/uscover3118.jpg?w=221", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hartstock1.jpg?crop=0px%2C334px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hartstock2.jpg?w=200"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hartstock1.jpg?crop=0px%2C334px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Dweck"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/desiree-hartsock-pregnant-expecting-baby-no-2-with-chris-siegfried/", "title": "Desiree Hartsock Pregnant, Expecting Baby No. 2 With Chris Siegfried", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Bachelorette\u2019 alum Desiree Hartsock exclusively reveals she\u2019s expecting her second child with husband Chris Siegfried \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Bachelorette\u2019s Desiree Hartsock Is Pregnant With Baby No. 2!", "description": "\u2018Bachelorette\u2019 alum Desiree Hartsock exclusively reveals she\u2019s expecting her second child with husband Chris Siegfried \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/desiree-hartsock-pregnant-expecting-baby-no-2-with-chris-siegfried/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-18T21:04:03+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hartstock1.jpg?crop=0px%2C334px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hartstock1.jpg?crop=0px%2C334px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Desiree Hartsock is pregnant"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-07-18T12:01:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-18T21:04:03+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Bachelorette\u2019 alum Desiree Hartsock exclusively reveals she\u2019s expecting her second child with husband Chris Siegfried \u2014 details", "title": "The Bachelorette\u2019s Desiree Hartsock Is Pregnant With Baby No. 2!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/hartstock1.jpg?crop=0px%2C334px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531915287.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
