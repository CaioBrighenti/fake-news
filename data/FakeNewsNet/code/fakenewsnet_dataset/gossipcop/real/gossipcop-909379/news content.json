In an interview with L\u2019official, the \u201cDon\u2019t Let Go\u201d singer shared how working with a team made up predominately of black women changed her \u201ccreative process,\u201d and shared what she hopes to teach her daughter.\n\nThe 32-year-old mom-to-be who is expecting her first child, a baby girl with her boyfriend, Alex Fine, hopes to one day make their daughter proud.\n\n\u201cMy priorities have absolutely changed, not just for creating an amazing future and life for my daughter, but because I want her to be proud of me,\u201d Cassie shared. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say that they\u2019re nervous to raise females in today\u2019s world, but I\u2019m excited! I can\u2019t wait to see her grow, learn and challenge the world right back!\u201d\n\nWhen asked about working with a crew of black female creatives, Cassie explained how the new squad has helped her confidence. \u201cWhen it comes to me choosing to work with certain people I have to go off of an organic connection. I love the fact that everyone that I work with now communicates fully on every aspect, we are not in competition, we work as a team and they actually understand who I am and who I want to mold myself to become. As a group, we work as a collective.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is the first time that I feel that I actually have a strong team in place that has my best interests at heart and the added bonus is that the majority of the team are creative black females. To me, it means we see each other,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe energy I feel when we\u2019re in a room together is unmatchable. We all have our own levels of experience and we bring our best to the table. We support each other and balance each other out all at the same time. It just works.\u201d\n\nWorking with the new team has changed her creatively because she feels fully supported and makes decisions based on \u201cwhat\u2019s best\u201d for her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a woman coming into my own learning to trust myself. It\u2019s empowering.\u201d\n\nClick here for the full interview.", "images": ["https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/spinderella-suing-salt-n-pepa-1562856595-240x135.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/lil-kim-blasts-media-1562792338-240x135.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/03/r-kelly-sends-birthday-video-to-daughter-child-support-1553086630-650x366.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2018/01/childish-gambino-terrified-grammy-performance-1517192871-compressed.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2018/01/childish-gambino-terrified-grammy-performance-1517192871-650x366.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/cardib-jennifer-lopez-hustlers-film-1553025230-768x768-1562858258-240x135.jpg", "https://www.vibe.com/assets/images/logo/white.svg?edb4fa5dcea44378cb64", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/cassie-GettyImages-954469910-1562990958-650x366.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/GettyImages-1160402526-2-1562776630-300x169.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/05/nipsey-hussle-guardianship-daughter-1556653448-1500x844-1557886865-1024x5761-1558400900-650x366.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://static.vibe.com/files/2018/01/childish-gambino-terrified-grammy-performance-1517192871-compressed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lola Jacobs"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vibe.com/2018/01/childish-gambino-terrified-grammys-2018-performance", "title": "Watch: Childish Gambino Performs \"Terrified\" At Grammys 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-01-29T01:34:09-05:00", "published_time": "2018-01-28T21:32:02-05:00"}, "description": "First time playing the Grammys?
