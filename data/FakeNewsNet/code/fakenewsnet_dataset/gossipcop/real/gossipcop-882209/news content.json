And in true Lawrence fashion, she made the night one to remember.\n\nDuring the Q&A portion of the night at the Museum of Modern Art, Lawrence jokingly gave the middle finger onstage while telling a story from set, as Aronofsky laughed alongside her.\n\nAs Lawrence recalled to the crowd, she injured her diaphragm hyperventilating on set, to which Darren said, \u201cIt\u2019s only a movie!\u201d She then flipped him off in jest.\n\nThe actress stunned in a black maxi dress with a floral pattern, while Aronofsky kept his look simple in a green button down and black pants.\n\nImage zoom Robin Marchant/Getty\n\nmother! stars Lawrence and Javier Bardem as a newlywed couple living in the middle of nowhere. Their marital bliss is interrupted when two unexpected guests \u2014 a man (Ed Harris) and his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) \u2014 arrive at their doorstep.\n\nCinemaScore, which grades films based on reactions from moviegoers at the start of the opening weekend, gave the movie a rare F rating.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be polarizing,\u201d Lawrence told reporters at the Toronto International Film Festival. \u201cSo it\u2019s just hilarious to see, you know, the people who love it, love it and they think it\u2019s amazing and they get it. And then the people who don\u2019t like it, absolutely despise it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no in between,\u201d she added.\n\nmother! is in theaters now.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/jennifer-lawrence-catt-sadler.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/awkwafina1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1897px%2C995.925px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/jennifer-lawrence.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C787.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/justin-bieber-bottle-cap-challenge.jpg?crop=0px%2C1076px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jenniferlawrence1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1450px%2C761.25px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/seb-gwyn-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/lawrence-maroney-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1147877121.jpg?crop=0px%2C95px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/mackle-more.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/cameron-boyce-c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1400px%2C735px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jennifer-lawrence-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C1245px%2C652px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/jennifer-lawrence19.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa0e0417eb759f3bcfad3fa133da10cb?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/willie-nelson-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/obama-wh.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2333px%2C1224.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/jennifer-lawrence19.jpg?crop=0px%2C51px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/david-foster-katharine-mcphee-2.jpg?crop=5px%2C329px%2C2623px%2C1376px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/look-whos-talking.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noomi-rapace-1.jpg?crop=836px%2C0px%2C1864px%2C1126px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/miranda-brendan-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/rex_avengers_endgame_film_premiere_arrival_10216456dw.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/js_vinny.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C673px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/danielle-fishel-baby.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/jennifer-lawrence19.jpg?crop=0px%2C51px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/jennifer-lawrence-mother-haters-middle-finger/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Jokingly Gives the Middle Finger at mother!
