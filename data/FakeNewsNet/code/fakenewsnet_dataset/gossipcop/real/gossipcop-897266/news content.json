Hamill even used The Empire Strikes Back\u2018s most famous line to humorously acknowledge Stan as his son. Both Stan and Hamill were guests on Good Morning America this week to promote their respective films: Avengers: Infinity War and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. While he was there, Stan took the opportunity to record a message for his \u201cdad\u201d that quickly made Hamill laugh.\n\nSebastian Stan has a message for his \u201cdad\u201d and look-a-like @HamillHimself and Mark touches on Stan as a potential young @StarWars Luke! #TheLastJedi pic.twitter.com/QHN3XCcuy3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Good Morning America (@GMA) November 30, 2017\n\nFollowing the video greeting, Hamill declined to directly endorse Stan to play a young Luke Skywalker in any potential movies, because \u201che doesn\u2019t need me. He\u2019s an accomplished enough actor to get it on his own, and I shouldn\u2019t put my thumb on the scale because it\u2019s not my choice.\u201d Having said that, Hamill offered praise for Stan\u2019s acting talent and said that he would welcome the chance to play Stan\u2019s father.\n\nCONSIDER SEBASTIAN STAN FOR A YOUNG LUKE SKYWALKER, SPECIALLY NOW THAT MARK HAMILL CONFIRMED HE IS HIS SON pic.twitter.com/MmN9MPggG8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d sofia DEAD (@RebelSugarcube) September 24, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear if Luke Skywalker has any children, but we\u2019re hoping that The Last Jedi will clear up that mystery. There is possibly a way that Hamill and Stan can rule a scene as father and son within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, if Hamill plays Bucky Barnes\u2019 father in a flashback sequence. We\u2019d still prefer a Star Wars connection between the two, but we\u2019ll take what we can get.What do you think about Stan\u2019s message for his \u201cdad\u201d?
