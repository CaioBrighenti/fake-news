And you really didn\u2019t know,\u201d she reminds Portman, who reveals: \u201cI maybe did but I maybe didn\u2019t want to tell everybody in the world. I still made the bet because I thought it would show either way.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

The couple, who married in 2012, is also parents to son Aleph, now 6.\n\n\u201cBut I kept good on my bet. Ellen bet $1,000 \u2026 You were confident, you were right to be confident, it\u2019s a girl!\u201d says Portman, who reveals that she made a $1,000 donation to the Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund.\n\nRELATED: Natalie Portman Returns to Work Eight Weeks After Giving Birth to Daughter Amalia\n\nThough Portman and Millepied, who met on the set of the 2010 hit thriller Black Swan, are notoriously private about their family life, the actress opened up about how parenthood has changed her for The New York Times\u2019 T Magazine.\n\n\u201c[Parenthood] made me much calmer under stress, because there\u2019s that weird parent thing you develop, that when things get really bad, your voice gets calm and your blood pressure slows, and you can make everything okay again,\u201d Portman wrote at the time.\n\nAnnihilation hits theaters Feb. 23.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/pullman3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630",
