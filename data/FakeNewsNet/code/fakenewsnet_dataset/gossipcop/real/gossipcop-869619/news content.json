When Tyga, Blac Chyna, and Lamar Odom all got the invite to attend the iGO.live launch event at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Wednesday, they all RSVP'd yes.

Yes, Scott Disick's maybe one-time fling Bella Thorne was also there.\n\nHey! Bella Thorne was ALSO there...\n\nOK, wait -- it gets better. Robert Shapiro (who most recently represented Chyna's ex, Rob) was also there(!). YES, ROBERT SHAPIRO. We know he's technically not a Kardashian or Jenner ex, but he is Kardashian adjacent, and having him in the mix makes this guest list substantially more intriguing and weird. Hands down.\n\n...as was Robert Shapiro because WHY NOT!?!?\n\nOh, to be a fly on that wall because...", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=8qj_CxiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-bella-thorne-embed.jpg?itok=-fVKj-TC", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-072717-chyna-tyga-lamar-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-071017-rob-ti.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/captain-sandy.jpg?itok=qXjF-_oI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-robert-shapiro.jpg?itok=1IxsUDf8", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/dorit-kemsley-morgan-stewart-look-alikes_0.jpg?itok=uElmmY9J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-chyna-lamar-embed.jpg?itok=kQaMphWo", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-black-chyna-embed.jpg?itok=MUBVv1ZE", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/barbara-luann-rhony.jpg?itok=lOYMeBeH", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/rhop-904-candiace-dinner-party-explosion_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=sLRmUfZw", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-071417-blac-chyna-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/225/655/190710_3986181_What_You_Didn_t_See_Ashley_Jacobs_Do_at_the_.jpg?itok=6y25G9ie", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/cynthia-kenya-kandi.jpg?itok=b8xgPLPA", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/327/663/190703_3983178_Is_Craig_Conover_Really_Over_Naomie_Olindo_.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-lamar-embed.jpg?itok=ZCKJVAuJ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/briana-ryan-culberson-grocery-shopping.jpg?itok=QiQLmgVL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/1021/703/190709_3985566_Andy_Cohen_Reacts_to_Lisa_Vanderpump_s_Absen.jpg?itok=lNfk2wvQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/tinsley-mortimer-reality-tv.jpg?itok=K4fcZgBt", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-tyga-embed.jpg?itok=SkBcNR9i", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/755/619/190627_3980046_Sonja_Morgan_on_Ramona_Singer___She_s_Very_H.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/below-deck-med-403-joao-cries-over-brooke_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/dorinda-luann-friendship.jpg?itok=_aGuNqe_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/148/263/190625_3978632_Dorit_Kemsley_on_Camille_Grammer_s_Accusatio.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-072717-chyna-tyga-lamar-promote.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jocelyn Vena"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/kardashian-exes-tyga-blac-chyna-and-lamar-odom-party-together-photos", "title": "Tyga, Blac Chyna, and Lamar Odom All Walk Into a Party...", "meta_data": {"title": "Kardashian Exes Tyga, Blac Chyna, Lamar Odom Party Together | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "This is the kind of thing you can't make up.
