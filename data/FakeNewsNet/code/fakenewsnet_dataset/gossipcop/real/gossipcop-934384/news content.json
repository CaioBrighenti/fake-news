(Published Thursday, May 10, 2018)\n\nHollywood Boulevard was shutdown at Highland Thursday because the Millennium Falcon was blocking traffic.\n\nNo, really.\n\nIt\u2019s all for the red carpet premiere of the latest Star Wars spin-off: \"Solo: A Star Wars Story.\"\n\nIt follows the tale of how Han Solo meets his trusty co-pilot Chewbacca years before they join the rebellion. Paul Bettany, Thandie Newton, Donald Glover, Woody Harrelson and Jon Favreau attended.\n\nSome fans showed up hoping to see some of the actors when they walked the red carpet around 5 p.m.\n\n\"I've been here for 15 hours, as always. I'm a super fan. I love the movie, the story, the heroes. This is my favorite movie ever,\" Luis Kezzer said.\n\n\n\nAnother fan, also quite dedicated, came from across the pond to check out the premiere.\n\n\"I prefer the spin-offs because they let the authors do other things, it\u2019s different, and you get surprise. That\u2019s the cool thing. It\u2019s not the typical three movies trilogy,\" said Daniel Buron, who came all the way from Barcelona.\n\nThe film, directed by Ron Howard, will be shown at the TCL Chinese Theatre, as well as the Dolby Theatre and the El Capitan.\n\nIt will open nationwide May 25.", "images": ["https://media.nbcnewyork.com/designimages/tw-footer.png", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/designimages/ots_light_wx_97.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/KVEA.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/nbc-ajax-loader.gif", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/logo_la_2x.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/images/tve-play-icon.png", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/images/la-icon.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/620*349/GettyImages-1077368442.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=836588206435122&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/designimages/yt-footer.png?1=1", "https://s.clickability.com/s?19=990&14=0&6=482338271&7=523232&25=0&18=0.8050816225635545", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/ots-double-arrow.png", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/designimages/fb-footer.png", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1202*675/starwars-solo-051018.PNG", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/designimages/ig-footer.png", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/652*367/Star_Wars_Spinoff__Solo__Premieres_in_Hollwyood.jpg", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/620*465/12-31-2018-rose-parade-irwindale+%281%29.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1202*675/starwars-solo-051018.PNG", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Star-Wars-Solo-Red-Carpet-Premiere-Fans-Hollywood-482338271.html", "title": "Star Wars Fans Show Up for 'Solo' Red Carpet in Hollywood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140, user-scalable=yes", "twitter": {"account_id": 17379685, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nbcla", "creator": "@nbcla", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Star-Wars-Solo-Red-Carpet-Premiere-Fans-Hollywood-482338271.html", "title": "Star Wars Fans Show Up for 'Solo' Red Carpet in Hollywood", "description": "Fans came out in droves for the red carpet premiere of 'Solo,' the next installment in the 'Star Wars' film legacy.
