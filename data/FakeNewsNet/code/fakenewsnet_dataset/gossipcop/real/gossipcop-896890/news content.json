(Photo by Lintao Zhang/Getty Images for Swarovski)\n\nModel Ming Xi took a tumble during the 2017 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show, which was filmed on Nov. 20. Originally, it was reported that the fall would not be televised, but it was shown on Tuesday night\u2019s CBS broadcast, reports E News. It appears that the 28-year-old model got tangled in her flowing, sheer ensemble.\n\nBut the Chinese model was a total pro, and did not let the fall affect her on stage. She kept a smile on the whole time, and even seemed to laugh at herself as she adjusted her hair and continued to walk down the catwalk. She received applause from the other models and the audience, reports E News.\n\nIt\u2019s not about how we fall, it\u2019s about how we get up. #VSFashionShow pic.twitter.com/NCe08O8OjU \u2014 CBS (@CBS) November 29, 2017\n\nBut the backstage footage shows some completely different emotions. Once she was away from the audience, Xi burst into tears. But she didn\u2019t suffer alone: footage shows models coming to comfort their friend.\n\nOne source told E News that \u201cMing was really upset when she fell on the runway. It was a hard fall. She got up as gracefully as she could. She was shaken up after that fall. All the models made her feel better after though. She is OK now.\u201d\n\nThe source told E News that Xi is \u201cone of the favorites\u201d to walk the Victoria\u2019s Secret runway and that it is every model\u2019s \u201cworst nightmare to fall.\u201d But the source also said that models \u201cembrace each other\u201d if anything unexpected, like Xi\u2019s fall, happens and that they are all \u201ca team.\u201d\n\nXi addressed the fall on Instagram.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest, we all wish we looked as good as Xi does when we stumble.", "images": ["https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Feature-5.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1129018186-e1561057407260.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1026231788-e1561652837358.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-6.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-517456986.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=381165108746682&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fuse-header.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shoes.png?resize=750%2C500", "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/vp/4a55138d9bc1f2983eb7d16fd6e3bf6f/5DC4A39B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67278870_173166897047305_7305263977630882127_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hero-22.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/unnamed-2.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hero-16.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/vp/34ad84bb5f57564002b437a8e23ac3ff/5DAD2CAF/t51.2885-19/s150x150/12144285_849557885143456_278058205_a.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/xi-11-29-17-e1511975476380-1.jpg?fit=1439%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/prime.png?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/norco.png?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/feature-7.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hero-24.jpg?resize=750%2C500"], "top_img": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/xi-11-29-17-e1511975476380-1.jpg?fit=1439%2C500", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Gibian"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insidehook.com/article/style/ming-xi-victorias-secret-fashion-show", "title": "Ming Xi Breaking Down in Tears After Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show Fall", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Model Ming Xi took a tumble during the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, which was filmed on Nov. 20.
