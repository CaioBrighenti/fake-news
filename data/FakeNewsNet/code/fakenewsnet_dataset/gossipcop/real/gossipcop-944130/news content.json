During a performance of \"Rock DJ,\" Williams flashed his middle finger directly into the camera on live television -- which prompted the game\u2019s broadcaster Fox to issue an apology.\n\nWilliams\u2019 performance and gesture came in the midst of a 20-minute ceremony at Luzhniki Stadium that also featured a speech from Russian President Vladimir Putin and elaborate dances.\n\nIn a statement given to The Hollywood Reporter, Fox explained that while their network did not produce the show, they are deeply sorry for what took place. \"The 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony was a newsworthy event produced by a third party and carried live on Fox. As it was broadcast live, we did not know what would happen during Robbie Williams\u2019 performance and we apologize.\"\n\nThis is the first time Russia is hosting the World Cup. In the initial game against Saudi Arabia, the host country reigned supreme 5-0.\n\nWatch fan-captured footage of Robbie Williams\u2019 performance below:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/troye-sivan-ds-bb15-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1529011017/images/Billboard-white.svg?31c8d8508d3d4d3e8f05", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/troye-sivan-ds-bb15-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/879509920/?value=1.00&currency_code=USD&label=wh8cCLa922cQoIOxowM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/robbie-williams-world-cup-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1554285401541797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/robbie-williams-world-cup-2018-billboard-1548.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/robbie-williams-world-cup-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shant\u00e9 Honeycutt"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615095526/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8461105/fox-apology-robbie-williams-flips-off-camera-world-cup", "title": "Fox Apologizes After Robbie Williams Flips Off Camera During World Cup Opening Ceremony", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Robbie Williams Flips Off Camera at World Cup; Fox Apologizes", "description": "The 2018 FIFA World Cup kicked off Thursday (June 14) in Moscow with a set of opening ceremony festivities, including a performance by British singer Robbie Williams.
