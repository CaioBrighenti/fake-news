Jimmy Kimmel shared his two cents about Kanye West\u2019s controversial TMZ interview during the Tuesday, May 1, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason, Kanye felt the need to spend a full hour on TMZ Live today to defend his love for Donald Trump and to go off on a tangent not seen since the glory days of Gary Busey on Celebrity Rehab,\u201d he joked after showing a clip of the rapper\u2019s admission that he was addicted to opioids after having liposuction in 2016.\n\nWest, 40, recounted upping his dosage from two pills a day to seven following a stint in the hospital. The late-night host suggested, \u201cMaybe you should be taking eight.\u201d\n\nThe Yeezy designer went on to compare TMZ to a hospital, at which point Kimmel said, \u201cKim, it\u2019s time to come get your husband.\u201d\n\nThe comedian, 50, tried to reason with West: \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, though \u2014 this job, doing this show every night is hard enough. Keeping up with the White House on a daily basis is exhausting. I can\u2019t handle Donald Trump and Kanye West at the same time. It\u2019s too much. It\u2019s like being a single mother with twins. I can\u2019t do it. One of you is gonna have to stop. I\u2019ll let you decide between yourselves which one it\u2019s gonna be.\u201d\n\nWest sparked outrage on Tuesday when he shared his views on slavery during his TMZ Live interview. \u201cYou hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, that was there for 400 years and it\u2019s all of y\u2019all? It\u2019s like, we\u2019re mentally in prison. I like the word \u2018prison\u2019 because slavery is too direct to the idea of blacks. Like Holocaust is Jews, slavery is blacks. So prison is something that unites us as one race, whites and blacks being one race. The human race.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFamous\u201d rapper later clarified his thoughts in a Twitter rant. \u201cto make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will,\u201d he tweeted Tuesday evening. \u201cMy point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved. They cut our tongues so we couldn\u2019t communicate to each other. I will not allow my tongue to be cut.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/183956752_kanye-west-jimmy-kimmel-zoom.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/183956752_kanye-west-jimmy-kimmel-zoom.jpg?crop=307px%2C131px%2C1468px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/183956752_kanye-west-jimmy-kimmel-zoom.jpg?crop=307px%2C131px%2C1468px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jimmy-kimmel-mocks-kanye-wests-tmz-interview/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Kanye West's TMZ Interview", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel has some thoughts about Kanye West\u2019s controversial TMZ interview \u2014 watch his reaction", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Kanye's TMZ Interview: Kim, Come Get Him", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel has some thoughts about Kanye West\u2019s controversial TMZ interview \u2014 watch his reaction", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jimmy-kimmel-mocks-kanye-wests-tmz-interview/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-02T17:48:22+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/183956752_kanye-west-jimmy-kimmel-zoom.jpg?crop=307px%2C131px%2C1468px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/183956752_kanye-west-jimmy-kimmel-zoom.jpg?crop=307px%2C131px%2C1468px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Kanye West on \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live\u2018"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-05-02T17:08:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-02T17:48:22+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel has some thoughts about Kanye West\u2019s controversial TMZ interview \u2014 watch his reaction", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Kanye's TMZ Interview: Kim, Come Get Him", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/183956752_kanye-west-jimmy-kimmel-zoom.jpg?crop=307px%2C131px%2C1468px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525280910.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
