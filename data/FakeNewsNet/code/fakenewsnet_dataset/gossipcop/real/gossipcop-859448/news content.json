Time and time again, we see many of the expensive, well thought-out items get left behind in hotel rooms,\" he says. \"Instead, consider giving a nice bottle of wine and a handwritten note, or making a donation to your favorite local charity in the guests names honor.\"\n\nExcited for in the new year: \"We have a couple who is focused on supporting underserved communities and working with female owned and operated local businesses for their wedding day,\" he says. \"This is an exciting prospect for us and a first for Alison Events to have a client that is so locally, globally and environmentally minded when planning their special day. We can't wait to see how it all comes together!\"\n\nCan't wait to see a couple do: \"A food and wine-focused wedding,\" he says. \"We love when clients embrace food and beverage as an integral part of the wedding celebration!\"\n\nBest planning advice: \"Get personal! Hire vendors you connect with on a personal level, not just ones that suit your aesthetic or budget,\" he says. \"Get to know a vendor over coffee or a glass of wine to make sure they are a good personality fit for your project and are someone you would want to spend a year of your life with planning such a big and important day in your life.\"\n\nSunna Yassin of Bash Please\n\nPinterest Photo by Lauren Ross\n\nThe year\u2019s biggest trend: \"Non traditional bridesmaid dresses in an eclectic mix in a color palette,\" she says.\n\nTrend to do away with: The ladies at Bash Please had two words on this subject: \"Photo booths!\"\n\nCan't wait to see a couple do: \"We love the idea of a bride and groom walking down the aisle together or having your guests stand during the ceremony to make it feel inclusive,\" Sunna says. \"These moments can truly set the tone for the rest of the wedding.\"\n\nBest planning advice: \"Before jumping on Instagram or Pinterest, talk to a few friends or relatives who recently got married, \" she recommends. \"It's always helpful to hear from people you trust about what they ended up enjoying the most about their own celebration!\"\n\nMichelle Rago of Michelle Rago Destinations\n\nPinterest Photo by Abby Ross; Planning by Michelle Rago Destinations\n\nThe year\u2019s biggest trend: \"For 2019, we are seeing both Portugal and Spain to be on the rise in terms of wedding destination inquiries,\" Michelle says. Also, vegan menus: \"We're seeing a surge in requests for not just vegan dishes as an option but the entire wedding meal from start to finish,\" she adds.\n\nTrend to do away with: \"The doughnut wall\u2014and right behind that, the 'naked' wedding cake,\" she says. And wedding favors! \"We encourage more meaningful communications such as handwritten notes to each guest upon arrival or spending a bit more with your photographer and videographer to send photo and video keepsakes when the wedding is over,\" she says.\n\nExcited for in the new year: \"I am hoping for less of a synthetic approach to luxury and a more meaningful and authentic approach to the overall guest experience,\" she says. \"Instead of having 15 entertainers in costume, perhaps bring your guests in a day earlier or stay one day longer and have a long lazy lunch to truly connect?!\"\n\nCan't wait to see a couple do: \"I am dying for a couple to do a fabulous party on the Orient Express because I think train travel is so chic,\" she says. \"My second hope is for a blow-out wedding that is a complete surprise for all the guests!\"\n\nBest planning advice: \"Don\u2019t limit yourself in choosing a location,\" Michelle suggests. \"There are so many amazing places in the world.

Or even no one at all!\"\n\nTrend to do away with: \"We're ready to see the days of showing off for the sake of showing off go away,\" Virginia says. \"Let's make weddings return to something that feels a bit more personal and heartfelt.
