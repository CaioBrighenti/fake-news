I wasn\u2019t in a girl group. I was in a prostitution ring,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOh & we happened to sing & be famous. While everyone who owned us made the $\u201d\n\nImage zoom Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nThe singer, 33, continued, \u201cHow bad was it? People ask-bad enough that I walked away from my dreams, bandmates&a 13 million dollar record deal. We knew we were going to#1\u201d\n\nMy truth.I wasn\u2019t in a girl group.

Meaning after they turn you out or get you hooked on drugs they use it against you.Correct.Victimizing the victim again \u2014 KAYA (@KayaJones) October 13, 2017\n\nWhy don\u2019t we report it? Because we are all abused! I personally have been warned if I tell I will \u2026 you know end up dead or no more career \u2014 KAYA (@KayaJones) October 13, 2017\n\nJones also called out the group\u2019s \u201cden mother from hell,\u201d alleging that a performer from one of her other girl groups killed herself. Twitter followers speculated that Jones was talking about G.R.L. singer Simone Battle, who committed suicide in September of 2014.\n\nAlthough Jones did not give a name, the founder of The Pussycat Dolls is widely known to be Robin Antin, who responded to the claims in an interview with The Blast.\n\nAntin called the allegations \u201cdisgusting, ridiculous lies\u201d and suggested that Jones is \u201cclearly looking for her 15 minutes.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jemal Countess/Getty Images\n\nThe choreographer also claimed that Jones was never an official member of the group \u2014 rather, she was just on a trial basis before the release of their 2005 debut album.\n\nNo other members have confirmed or denied the accusations. A rep for Antin told PEOPLE she had no additional comment.\n\nFormer Pussycat Dolls member Carmit Bachar did not directly address Jones\u2019 claims, but she retweeted Alyssa Milano\u2019s call for victims of sexual abuse and harassment to post \u201cme too\u201d on their social media pages.", "images":
