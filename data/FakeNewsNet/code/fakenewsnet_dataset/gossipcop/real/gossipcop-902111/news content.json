He is the third child of pop legend Michael Jackson and allegedly the only biological child of the pop star, but no confirmation has ever been made.\n\nDebbie Rowe, the mother of Michael Jackson's other two children \u2014 Paris Michael Katherine and Michael Joseph \"Prince\" Jackson \u2014 publicly denied being Blanket's biological mother, following his birth and subsequent media speculation regarding his conception.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

The pop star was 50 years old at the time of his death; Prince Michael Jackson II was 7.\n\nJackson's grandmother, Katherine Jackson, became his legal guardian, as well as the guardian of his siblings, Michael Joseph and Paris Jackson.\n\nThe three kids spoke to their father's fans during his funeral in 2009, and again in January 2010, accepting a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award for Michael Jackson at the Grammy Awards.\n\nIn February 2010, an official coroner's report on Michael Jackson's death was released, revealing that the singer had died from acute propofol intoxication. Aided by his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael had used the drug, among others, to help him sleep.\n\nA police investigation revealed later that Murray hadn't been licensed to prescribe most controlled medications in California, and the doctor's actions as Michael's caretaker were subsequently further scrutinized. Murray was found guilty of homicide on November 7, 2011, receiving a four-year prison sentence.\n\nWrongful Death Lawsuit\n\nBelieving that A.E.G. Live \u2014 the entertainment company that promoted Michael Jackson's planned comeback series, \"This Is It,\" in 2009 \u2014 had failed to effectively protect the singer while he was under Dr. Conrad Murray's care, the Jackson family decided to take legal action against the company. Katherine Jackson officially filed a wrongful death lawsuit against A.E.G. with Prince Michael Jackson II, Michael Jr. and Paris.\n\nThe trial began in April 2013. Lawyers sought up to $1.5 billion, an estimation of what Michael Jackson could have earned over the months since his death if he were still alive, in the case.\n\nIn October 2013, a jury determined that A.E.G. wasn't responsible for Michael's death. \"Although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of A.E.G. Live's making,\" said Marvin S. Putnam, A.E.G.'s lawyer.\n\nBlanket\u2019s Name Change to Bigi\n\nIn 2015, several reports surfaced that Jackson no longer wished to be called by his nickname, \"Blanket.\" Radar Online claimed that the young teen now wanted to be addressed as \"Bigi.\" He took the name after being bullied for years for his \"Blanket\" moniker.\n\nA rare photo of Prince Michael Jackson, along with friend Omer Bhatti, sister Paris and brother Prince in December 2017.

He attends the Buckley School, a private school in Sherman Oaks, California. Due to his grandmother's advanced age, along with siblings Michael and Paris leaving the nest as young adults, Jackson is now under the supervision of older cousin T.J. Jackson.\n\nWhile sources told People magazine that he had the hardest time of his siblings adjusting after his father\u2019s death, he is now doing well, focusing on grades and sports and spending time with his more than 30 cousins.\n\nAmong the Jackson's kids, Bigi Jackson has generally stayed out of the spotlight. However he made a rare appearance at older brother Prince Jackson\u2019s graduation from Loyola Marymount College in Los Angeles in May 2019.", "images": ["https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU2MTUyNzU2NTM1NTY3NjI5/paris-jackson-attends-the-59th-grammy-awards-at-staples-center-on-february-12-2017-in-los-angeles-california-photo-by-frazer-harrison_getty-images-square.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_170%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTQ1MTQwNTY0MjczMTQ1MjQw/the-jackson-5---michaels-talent.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU2MTUyNzkwNjI2ODcwODg0/_prince-jackson-attends-the-2016-gq-men-of-the-year-party-at-chateau-marmont-on-december-8-2016-in-los-angeles-california-photo-by-stefanie-keenan_getty-images-for-gq-square.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTIwNjA4NjMzNjgwODU2NTg4/joseph-jackson-467150-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTU2MTUzMjYxOTk5NTMxMjc3/blanket-jackson-2017.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_458/MTQ1NTMzOTkyNDA0MjY0NTAz/sitelogowhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTU2MTUzMjUwOTkzNjc3NTgx/blanket-jackson-attends-the-mr-pink-ginseng-drink-launch-party-at-regent-beverly-wilshire-hotel-on-october-11-2012-in-beverly-hills-california-photo-by-jason-laveris_filmmagic.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE1ODA0OTcxMjkwNTYwMDEz/michael-jackson-pepsi-commercial-raw.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NDg0MDU0ODMzODI1Mjk1/katherine-jackson-466952-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTIwNjA4NjM0MDU0ODA1MDA0/janet-jackson-9542443-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE1ODA0OTcxNDkxOTUyMTQx/jermaine-jackson-467390-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTU2MTUzNTY3MjEwNjQ1MDky/blanket-jackson-attends-the-mr-pink-ginseng-drink-launch-party-at-regent-beverly-wilshire-hotel-on-october-11-2012-in-beverly-hills-california-photo-by-jason-laveris_filmmagic-square.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_170%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTQ1MTQwNTY2NDIwNjI4ODg4/michael-jackson---mini-biography.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTU2MTUzNTY3MjEwNjQ1MDky/blanket-jackson-attends-the-mr-pink-ginseng-drink-launch-party-at-regent-beverly-wilshire-hotel-on-october-11-2012-in-beverly-hills-california-photo-by-jason-laveris_filmmagic-square.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NDg0MDU1MzMxMTc3OTk5/11th-annual-children-uniting-nations-oscar-celebration.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTQ1NTM0MTQ5NzA3NDQxNzE5/navbarwhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NDg0MDU1MzE3NDE1NDM5/tj-jackson-20897709-1-402.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTU2MTUzNTY3MjEwNjQ1MDky/blanket-jackson-attends-the-mr-pink-ginseng-drink-launch-party-at-regent-beverly-wilshire-hotel-on-october-11-2012-in-beverly-hills-california-photo-by-jason-laveris_filmmagic-square.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.biography.com/personality/prince-michael-blanket-jackson-ii", "title": "Prince Michael \"Blanket\" Jackson II", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "Rw9Z4UJK89QUjgFzrFI2QbZmTRyWu_Cuy15hu4Y1MXw", "msvalidate.01": "565AA37CB662E60BF24DDCABEC686D8F", "generator": "Tempest -
