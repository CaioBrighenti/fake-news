Of Azalea, the singer said, \"She had a complete disregard for black culture. F---king moron. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.\"\n\nIn response, Azalea told Smallzy, \"I thought it was a bit of a strange thing to throw that out there, but she's young and I hope she learns maybe to be a bit less judgmental when she's kind of in the same shoes. I'm sure she's getting judged all the time as well by people who don't really know her. So I think maybe it'd be good for her to try to be a little more empathetic to other people that are in the same situation.\"\n\nListen to the full interview here.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colin Stutz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7849211/iggy-azalea-halseys-response-moron-never-met-her", "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her'", "description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "og": {"title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her'", "description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7849211/iggy-azalea-halseys-response-moron-never-met-her", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7849211/iggy-azalea-halseys-response-moron-never-met-her", "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her'", "description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
