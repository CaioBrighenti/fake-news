{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Got_Talent_(season_12)", "text": "Season twelve of the reality competition series America's Got Talent was ordered on August 2, 2016 and premiered on NBC on Tuesday, May 30, 2017. Howie Mandel, Mel B, Heidi Klum and Simon Cowell returned as judges for their respective eighth, fifth, fifth and second seasons.[2] Supermodel and businesswoman Tyra Banks replaced Nick Cannon, who hosted for eight seasons, making her the first female host of the show.[3] The live shows returned to the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles beginning August 15, 2017.\n\nThe format of the show was the same as in season eleven, and Dunkin Donuts sponsors the show for a third consecutive season.[4] A guest judge joined the panel for each episode of the Judge Cuts round: Chris Hardwick, DJ Khaled, Laverne Cox and Seal.[5][6][7]\n\nDarci Lynne Farmer was named the winner on the season finale, September 20, 2017. She was the third ventriloquist, third child and third female to win a season of America's Got Talent. 10-year-old singer Angelica Hale placed second, and glow light dance troupe Light Balance came in third.[8] Farmer won the show's prize of $1 million and a headlining performance in Las Vegas.[9]\n\nSeason changes [ edit ]\n\nOn October 4, 2016, Simon Cowell signed a contract to remain as a judge through 2019.[10]\n\nLong-time host Nick Cannon announced, on February 13, 2017, that he would not return as host for season 12, soon after he made disparaging remarks about NBC in his 2017 Showtime comedy special, Stand Up, Don't Shoot.[11] Cannon was still under contract to host, and NBC executives did not initially accept his resignation, but they ultimately searched for a new host.[12]\n\nOn March 12, 2017, NBC announced supermodel Tyra Banks as the host for this season.[3]\n\nPreliminary auditions [ edit ]\n\nThe season had preliminary open call auditions in Chicago, Austin, Cleveland, Jacksonville, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, San Diego, New York City, Charleston, Memphis, and Los Angeles.[13] As in years past, prospective contestants could also submit online auditions.\n\nJudges' auditions were taped in March at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles. The premiere aired May 30, 2017.[citation needed]\n\nGolden Buzzer [ edit ]\n\nThe Golden Buzzer returned for its fourth consecutive season. Any act that received a golden buzzer during the preliminary auditions was sent directly to the live shows and did not compete in the Judge Cuts round. In the first episode of preliminary auditions, Mel B pressed the golden buzzer for 12-year-old singing ventriloquist Darci Lynne Farmer. In subsequent episodes, Simon Cowell pressed it for 29-year-old deaf singer-songwriter and ukeleleist, Mandy Harvey, Howie Mandel chose 16-year-old singer Christian Guardino, Tyra Banks pressed it for Light Balance dance crew, and Heidi Klum chose 13-year-old singer Angelina Green.[14]\n\nDeath of Brandon Rogers [ edit ]\n\nOn June 11, 2017, contestant Brandon Rogers died in an automobile accident. Rogers was an American physician who specialized in family medicine. Earlier in 2017, after seeing YouTube videos of Rogers singing, Boyz II Men invited him to sing with them as a guest in three of their Las Vegas shows. His successful AGT audition aired on July 11, 2017, in his memory.[15] He competed in the Judge Cuts round, but his performance in that round was not televised.[16]\n\nJudge Cuts [ edit ]\n\nThe Judge Cuts round began on Tuesday, July 18, 2017. Like the previous season, one guest judge joined the judges' panel each show and was given one golden buzzer opportunity to send an act straight to the live shows. Twenty acts were shown each week and seven advanced, including the guest judge's golden buzzer choice. Guest judges were not given a red buzzer to use. Any act that received all four red buzzers was immediately eliminated from the competition. The four guest judges were Chris Hardwick, DJ Khaled, Laverne Cox, and Seal.\n\nAfter the Judge Cuts, three wildcards were chosen from eliminated acts to perform in the live shows: Final Draft, Bello Nock and Oskar and Gaspar (who did not perform in the Judge Cuts round). All three of these acts were eliminated in the Quarterfinals.\n\nGolden Buzzer [ edit ]\n\nEach Judge Cuts act that received a golden buzzer advanced to the live shows without any voting by the judges. During the Judge Cuts round, guest judges Chris Hardwick pressed his golden buzzer for 9-year old singer Angelica Hale, DJ Khaled pressed it for 21-year old singer-songwriter and guitarist Chase Goehring, Laverne Cox pressed it for 9-year old singer Celine Tam, and Seal pressed it for soul singer Johnny Manuel.[14]\n\nKey Buzzed Golden buzzer Advanced Quarterfinal Wildcard Eliminated Eliminated Immediately Advanced Immediately\n\nWeek 1 [ edit ]\n\nGuest judge: Chris Hardwick\n\nDate: July 18, 2017\n\nAct Order Performance Type Buzzes Result Cowell Klum Hardwick Mel B Mandel Sara and Hero 1 Dog Act Advanced The Baker Family 2 Bluegrass Band Eliminated Mariachi Nuevo Santander 3 Mariachi Group Eliminated The Masqueraders 4 Vocal Group Advanced Eric Jennifer 5 Comedian Eliminated Harrison Greenbaum 6 Comedian Eliminated Dancing Pumpkin Man 7 Dancer Eliminated Tom London 8 Magician Eliminated Eric Jones 9 Close-Up Magician Advanced Angelica Hale 10 Singer Advanced Immediately Danylo and Oskar 11 Acrobat Duo Eliminated Lera and Nika Tomanova 12 Aerial Duo Eliminated Yoselin Chi 13 Hand Balancer Eliminated Darcy Callus 14 Singer And Keyboardist Eliminated Carlos De Antonis 15 Opera Singer Eliminated Canion Shijirbat 16 Multimedia Dancer Eliminated Just Jerk 17 Hip-Hop Dance Group Advanced Maw Kitty 18 Singer Eliminated The Singing Trump 19 Singing Trump Impersonator Advanced Demian Aditya 20 Escape Artist Advanced\n\nWeek 2 [ edit ]\n\nGuest judge: DJ Khaled\n\nDate: July 25, 2017\n\nThis is the first Judge Cuts episode in the show's history in which an act with at least one \"X\" buzzer was nevertheless promoted to the live shows.
