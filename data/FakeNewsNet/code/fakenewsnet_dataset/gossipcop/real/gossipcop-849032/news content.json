He also told the Texas paper that his dad had spent the last few years battling Alzheimer\u2019s disease, suggesting a cause of death.\n\nWhile his sons are both household names, Robert was a successful TV icon himself. Not only did he help launch Jim Lehrer\u2019s career with \u201cNewsroom\u201d through local, public affiliate KERA in 1968 \u2014 Lehrer famously hosted PBS\u2019 \u201cNewsHour\u201d from 1975-2011 \u2014 he was also responsible for bringing \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus\u201d to American television screens.\n\nOwen even once attributed his comedy stylings to his father while promoting \u201cMidnight in Paris\u201d in 2011. \u201cHe worked with these great creative people with great senses of humor and I remember being at dinner and just hearing Dad\u2019s friends talk,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was for me and my brothers a big influence on what was funny.\u201d\n\nRobert\u2019s declining health became noticeable that same year when he was unable to attend KERA\u2019s 50th anniversary celebration.\n\nLuke, Owen, and brother Andrew add that anyone wishing to pay their respects can do so by making a donation to PBS.", "images":
