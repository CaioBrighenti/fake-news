Now a decade later, it feels incredible to be a part of the most-viewed video on YouTube.\"\n\nWiz Khalifa added, \"I'm super excited and grateful to everyone who supported the song and video on YouTube, and happy to inspire and impact so many lives.\u201d", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_12x5_992.jpg", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Andrea Dresdale"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "It beat out former top video", "keywords": "see you again, charlie puth,entertainment news, celebrity news, celebrity gossip", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "description": "It beat out former top video \"Gangnam Style.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "see you again, charlie puth", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "description": "It beat out former top video \"Gangnam Style.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,48571822", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,48571822", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,48571822", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,48571822", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
