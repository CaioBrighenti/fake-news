She\u2019s done an absolutely amazing job, she\u2019s getting in there and it\u2019s the family that I suppose she never had.\u201d\n\nHours after that interview aired, Markle\u2019s estranged half sister, Samantha Grant, took to twitter to respond to that particular comment.\n\nGrant tweeted in part \u201cactually she has a large family who were always there with her and for her.\u201d\n\nGrant went on to write how Meghan always had a family and that \u201cmarrying merely extends it.\u201d\n\nSamantha also talked about their father, Thomas Markle.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Grant has spoken publicly about her half sister. She is also writing a tell-all book about the former Suits actress.\n\nMarkle and Prince Harry are set to tie the knot on May 19, 2018 at St George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.", "images":
