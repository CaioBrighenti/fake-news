Season 9 of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition is coming to WE tv in March 2018 and Us Weekly can exclusively reveal the cast.\n\nThe new season will feature:\n\n\u2013 Mob Wives stars Renee Graziano with her sisters Lana Graziano Zanococchio and Jennifer Graziano\n\n\u2013 Teen Mom OG star Amber Portwood with her ex-fianc\u00e9 Matt Baier and mom Tonya Portwood\n\n\u2013 Love and Hip Hop and Vow or Never star Jim Jones with his girlfriend Chrissy Lampkin and Mama Jones\n\n\u2013 The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville and dad Guy Glanville\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t choose family but you can choose therapy,\u201d the voiceover says in the exclusive teaser video above. We also get a hint of each family\u2019s issue just by their photos on the wall.\n\n\u201cI want you to be my father,\u201d Brandi yells at her dad.\n\n\u201cI tried to give you a family,\u201d Amber says to Matt. \u201cI don\u2019t want that family,\u201d he responds.\n\nOf course, Amber and Matt do not end up together at the end of this \u2014 but the show does impact her life in a huge way. Amber, 27, actually met her current boyfriend, Andrew Glennon, while filming this season of Marriage Boot Camp as he was part of the camera crew. The two are now expecting their first child together. During a recent episode of Teen Mom OG, the cinematographer actually revealed to Amber\u2019s friends that during shooting, he would try to always shoot her scenes so he could be in the same room with her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect. Having a new baby is new likes, new wants, new needs, so it\u2019s very nerve-racking,\u201d Amber, who is also the mother to Leah, 9, with her ex Gary Shirley, told Us in November. \u201cWe\u2019re both very happy. I feel like it\u2019s a new chapter of my life.\u201d\n\nMarriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition will air on WE tv in March 2018.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-brandi-glanville.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/marriage-boot-camp.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-brandi-glanville.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-brandi-glanville.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/marriage-boot-camp-reality-stars-family-edition-cast-revealed/", "title": "\u2018Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition\u2019 Cast Revealed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "The new season of \u2018Marriage Boot Camp\u2019 will include a \u2019Teen Mom\u2019 star and a \u2018Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 family \u2014 read Us Weekly\u2019s exclusive cast announcement", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meet the New Cast of \u2018Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition'", "description": "The new season of \u2018Marriage Boot Camp\u2019 will include a \u2019Teen Mom\u2019 star and a \u2018Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 family \u2014 read Us Weekly\u2019s exclusive cast announcement", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/marriage-boot-camp-reality-stars-family-edition-cast-revealed/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-11T18:49:13+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-brandi-glanville.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-brandi-glanville.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Amber Portwood and Brandi Glanville"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-01-11T18:55:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-11T18:49:13+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The new season of \u2018Marriage Boot Camp\u2019 will include a \u2019Teen Mom\u2019 star and a \u2018Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u2019 family \u2014 read Us Weekly\u2019s exclusive cast announcement", "title": "Meet the New Cast of \u2018Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-brandi-glanville.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515696902.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
