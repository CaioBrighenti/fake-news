Truth be told, and this is crazy, but I\u2019ve always wanted twins. Finding out that I was having them was one of the most amazing moments of my life. They\u2019ll have a built-in bestie for life.\n\nUs: Were you secretly hoping for a specific gender?\n\nVG: Honestly, I wanted girls. I thought they were boys until I started picking out nurseries. I put pictures side by side and I looked at them and realized I picked out seven girl nurseries! It was psychological.\n\nUs: Have you been tossing around names?\n\nVG: I have four picked out. Now that I know they\u2019re girls, I\u2019ll say the names out loud like I\u2019m talking to them and figure out what sounds best.\n\nUs: You look amazing! How are you staying fit?\n\nVG: I can\u2019t really work out because I have a high-risk pregnancy. But I do prenatal yoga, which is nice because my body gets stiff. My first trimester was really difficult because I had no appetite at all.\n\nUs: Why is it high risk?\n\nVG: The twins are monochorionic diamniotic. They share a placenta, which means they also share nutrients. One baby can potentially take more from the other, so I have monitoring every two weeks. The moment doctors see one growing bigger, there\u2019s a surgery they can do.\n\nUs: Any strange cravings?\n\nVG: Peaches and pickled eggs. It\u2019s a redneck thing! And Coca-Cola from the glass bottle. That sounds picky, but it tastes so good.\n\n\n\nCeleb Moms and Their Pregnancy Cravings\n\nUs: Most surprising aspect of pregnancy?\n\nVG: I have to pee a lot. I\u2019ll get in bed and I\u2019ll have to get back out. By the 10th trip, I\u2019m laying there thinking, \u201cJust put a catheter in!\u201d It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nUs: What excites you most about motherhood?\n\nVG: All of it! I get to take them to Disneyland and to the beach for the first time. With kids, it\u2019s all new and exciting. And I\u2019m really excited to dress them up. Isn\u2019t the best part of having twins dressing them in matching clothes?\n\nUs: Who are you leaning on for advice and support?\n\nVG: Three of my cousins and two of my best friends are pregnant right now. It\u2019s nice because our kids are going to grow up together \u2014 and I get maternity clothes passed down. My mom is going to live with me for the first two months to help with the babies.\n\nUs: What would you say if your girls asked to go on The Bachelor?\n\nVG: If you\u2019re doing it for fun and to travel and meet incredible people, go for it. Don\u2019t do it because you think you\u2019re going to fall in love. [Laughs]\n\nUs: Would you ever return to reality TV?\n\nVG: I\u2019ve been asked to do Bachelor in Paradise and Famously Single and I\u2019ve said no. I\u2019ve enjoyed life out of the spotlight. But I\u2019ve been approached to do a docuseries about my life and raising twins. I\u2019ve been thinking about it, as long as it\u2019s not about the drama and ratings.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
