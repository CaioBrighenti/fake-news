Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nMost people struggle with their body image at some point or another \u2014 even Rihanna. The singer recently told The Cut that her body image influences the way she dresses, which we first read about on StyleCaster.\n\n\"I actually have had the pleasure of a fluctuating body type, where one day I can literally fit into something that is body-con, and then the next day \u2014 the next week \u2014 I need something oversized,\" she told The Cut. \"I need a little crop here and a high-waist there to hide that part, you know?\"\n\n\"I really pay attention every day when I go into the closet about what's working for my body that morning. I feel like that's how everyone should go after fashion, because it's an individual thing,\" she continued.\n\nThe singer explained that she takes certain factors into account while planning an outfit.\n\n\"If you take it further, it's like: What week are you having? You having a skinny week? You having a fat week? Are we doing arms this week? We doing legs this week? We doing oversized?\" she said.\n\nRegardless of how she feels, Rihanna said that she sees fashion as something fun.\n\n\"I love to play with silhouettes as well, but I think it's important to make sure that you wear the thing that works for your body the best, and that's flattering,\" Rihanna explained.\n\nNo matter what she's wearing or how she's feeling, we're obsessed with Rihanna's trendsetting, runway-inspired sense of style.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6-1136-568.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59ca7e47ba785e6cf76b2d63-750-562.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6-1136-568.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susanna Heller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/rihanna-outfits-body-type-style-2017-10", "title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-10-17", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-17", "news_keywords": "Style, Fashion, Rihanna, Body Image, Celebrity, Susanna Heller", "sailthru.tags": "Style, Fashion, Rihanna, Body Image, Celebrity, Susanna Heller", "description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "sailthru.description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6-1136-568.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe5-960-720.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe5-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "sailthru.author": "Susanna Heller", "og": {"title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rihanna-outfits-body-type-style-2017-10", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6-1136-568.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Susanna Heller, INSIDER", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rihanna-outfits-body-type-style-2017-10", "title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6-1136-568.jpg", "creator": "@susiehheller", "site": "@"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508212800.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
