I haven't been on vacation in years! hbu [how about you] @TomHolland1996?\" she tweeted.\n\nHolland, 21, who plays Spider-Man, responded with some laughing emojis and joked, \"Does the press tour count?\"\n\nZendaya's final tweet on the romance rumors was, \"I'm done,\" with a crying/laughing emoji and raised hand emoji.\n\nThat settles the question of romantic involvement, but it won't stop people from wanting it to be true.\n\n(Note: Minor spoilers for \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" are below.)\n\nIt's unclear whether the two characters will become romantically involved in future movies. Zendaya's character, Michelle, revealed at the end of the film that her nickname is MJ. The moniker is used as the nickname for Mary Jane, Spider-Man's love interest in the comics, so it could happen. Though, it is safe to say after their responses that these two are just friends in real life.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5968ce139d09180cb162d472-750-375.png", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5968ce139d09180cb162d471-960-480.png"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5968ce139d09180cb162d471-960-480.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anjelica Oswald"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/are-spider-man-costars-zendaya-tom-holland-dating-2017-7", "title": "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-07-14", "sailthru.date": "2017-07-14", "news_keywords": "Zendaya, Tom Holland, Spider Man, Spider Man Homecoming, Movies, Culture, People, Anjelica Oswald", "sailthru.tags": "Zendaya, Tom Holland, Spider Man, Spider Man Homecoming, Movies, Culture, People, Anjelica Oswald", "description": "The stars of the new Marvel movie may be heating up the screen, but they had to address reports of a romance offscreen.", "sailthru.description": "The stars of the new Marvel movie may be heating up the screen, but they had to address reports of a romance offscreen.", "title": "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.title": "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5968ce139d09180cb162d471-960-480.png", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5968ce139d09180cb162d470-750-563.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5968ce139d09180cb162d470-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "sailthru.author": "Anjelica Oswald", "og": {"title": "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life", "description": "The stars of the new Marvel movie may be heating up the screen, but they had to address reports of a romance offscreen.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/are-spider-man-costars-zendaya-tom-holland-dating-2017-7", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5968ce139d09180cb162d471-960-480.png", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Anjelica Oswald, INSIDER", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/are-spider-man-costars-zendaya-tom-holland-dating-2017-7", "title": "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life", "description": "The stars of the new Marvel movie may be heating up the screen, but they had to address reports of a romance offscreen.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5968ce139d09180cb162d471-960-480.png", "creator": "@thisisjelli", "site": "@"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500004800.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
