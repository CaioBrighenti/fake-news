But the girl\u2019s crazy-talented, she really is. And she\u2019s an amazing woman, an amazing human being,\u201d says Duhamel, 45, of Fergie, 42, with whom he shares custody of their 4-year-old son Axl. (The former couple announced their separation after eight years of marriage in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE in September.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see someone you care about get beat up like that. But that\u2019s the business \u2014 you\u2019re in this business, and you put yourself out there; sometimes you win, and sometimes you don\u2019t,\u201d he adds.\n\nImage zoom Josh Duhamel on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nThe actor says the singer is unfazed by the backlash. After all, big girls don\u2019t cry.\n\n\u201cTrust me, she\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cShe is about as resilient as they come.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Fergie performing at the NBA All-Stars Game Allen Berezovsky/Getty\n\nThe day after the All-Star game, Fergie opened up about her polarizing performance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been honored and proud to perform the national anthem and last night I wanted to try something special for the NBA,\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn\u2019t strike the intended tone. I love this country and honestly tried my best.\u201d\n\nFor more on Josh Duhamel, watch The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Friday; check your local listings.", "images":
