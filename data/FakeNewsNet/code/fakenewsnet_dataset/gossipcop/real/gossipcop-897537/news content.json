Some of them are too promotional, some are too controversial, and others have accounts but barely tweet at all.\n\nSEE ALSO: 69 times Ryan Reynolds was hands down the funniest actor on Twitter\n\nChrissy Teigen, meanwhile, is an example of an excellent tweeter. She's pretty much got it nailed. Whether she's deftly handling nipple-related Snapchat issues or live-tweeting a naked British dating show, she does it with style.\n\nEvery now and then, Teigen also likes to vent. And while plenty of people come unhinged when they're in venting mode, Chrissy Teigen has a glorious knack for it.\n\nFrom shouty tweets aimed at John Legend to the time she got totally fed up with Mario, here are Teigen's most hilariously angry tweets.\n\n1. The time she'd had just about enough of those Macbook update requests.\n\nHate this macbook relationship. \"When do you want to update?\" \"Later\" \"later today or later tomorrow?\" Oh my god just fucking LATER \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 22, 2016\n\n2. Not to mention those Flash Player download requests.\n\nfucking tired of having to download the newest flash player just make the fucking best flash player \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) December 4, 2014\n\n3. This sweary acceptance of the inevitable.\n\ni am basically just refreshing websites until i fucking die i guess \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) June 8, 2014\n\n4. This rage-filled resolution.\n\none of my life goals is to reset all my passwords and fucking WRITE THEM DOWN. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) December 28, 2012\n\n5. The time she was absolutely done with Mario.\n\nI will sell everything below the television to the person that gets me past the shitfuck Mario world above it pic.twitter.com/V9AoK21c2v \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) June 22, 2014\n\n6. The time she made her feelings about John Legend's lack of phone response abundantly clear.\n\n@johnlegend hey I'm alive it's fine you don't have to answer your phone I WOULDNT WANT U TO WORRY \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 19, 2017\n\n7. And the time she made her views on his vocal warmups even clearer.\n\nI know he has a beautiful voice and I know I am \"soooooo lucky\" and blah blah but john's vocal warmups make me want to stab my brain \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) June 19, 2017\n\n8. This blunt take-down of \"relationship goals\".\n\nHow is John taking off my jewelry \"relationship goals\" like your fuckin boyfriend won't take your necklace off jfc leave him \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 14, 2017\n\n9. The time she'd had it up to here with frozen food.\n\nWhy the fuck do frozen foods assume your drunk ass knows the wattage of your microwave? My sober ass doesn't even know. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) December 9, 2012\n\n10. And the time she'd definitely had enough of Thanksgiving.\n\nFUCK TURKEY! \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) November 24, 2014\n\n11. The time she was 100% done with air travel.\n\nStop putting your stupid fucking purse and coat in the overhead compartment and keep it at your feet like everyone else you ASSHOLE \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) November 19, 2013\n\n12. The time she totally annihilated Fox News.\n\n.@chrissyteigen speaks out against @united for banning girls from boarding their flight because they wore leggings. https://t.co/MfJossREO7 pic.twitter.com/h38GMWJL2B \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) March 27, 2017\n\nI respectfully ask you please don't ever tag me in anything, ever. Words cannot explain how much I detest you. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) March 27, 2017\n\n13. This spectacularly no-nonsense reply to a Trump supporter.\n\nJust another celebrity that doesn't live in the real World and has no idea what the hell is going on. \u2014 Chris Sussdorf (@chrissussdorf) January 28, 2017\n\nYeah I am watching from a fucking throne in space. https://t.co/FVUlhHijFf \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 28, 2017\n\n14. And this equally cutting response to Trump himself.\n\nThe failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017\n\nYou are 71 fucking years old. Grow. The fuck. Up. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) June 28, 2017\n\n15. The great Chrissy Teigen vs. Debra Mullarkey feud of 2016.\n\nHave u ever seen a more epic feud pic.twitter.com/LDitpCeaq7 \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) November 28, 2016\n\n16. The time she really, really didn't want to be sent any more baby photos.\n\nFor the LAST TIME, JOHN looks like a baby so A LOT OF BABIES LOOK LIKE HIM STOP SENDING ME JOHN BABIES \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 4, 2017\n\n17. This delightfully sweary riposte.\n\n@chrissyteigen you are a great role model for your child swearing all over social media. Grow up and stop whining show some respect #trump \u2014 J (@j_roc83) November 21, 2016\n\nMy daughter isn't on social media, you ignorant tool. Go fuck yourself. Fuck fuck fuck! https://t.co/BDixmTIXXF \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) November 21, 2016\n\n18. The time she absolutely blasted this floral ice cream trend.\n\nBlooming rose ice cream pic.twitter.com/CdYX7PFI4g \u2014 DIY Foods (@DIYcookery) July 11, 2017\n\nOh jfc just fucking scoop the ice cream https://t.co/BfwR3bceup \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 11, 2017\n\n19. Finally, the time she had these very strong words for iCloud.\n\niCloud you KILL ME. But you actually don't. That's the worst part. I wish you just actually killed me so I don't have to deal with your shit \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) November 8, 2013\n\nChrissy: 19 \u2014 Everything Else: 0.", "images":
