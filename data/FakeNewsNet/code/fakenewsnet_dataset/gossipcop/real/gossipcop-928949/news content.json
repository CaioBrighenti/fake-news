(Published Friday, April 20, 2018)\n\nWhat to Know A Florida man has been accused of breaking into Taylor Swift's SoHo townhouse and taking a shower and nap, sources say\n\nHe was arrested on trespassing, stalking and burglary charges; he was also reportedly cuffed outside the home in February\n\nIt was the fourth time in three weeks a man was cuffed at one of the \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" singer's properties.\n\nA Florida man is accused of breaking into Taylor Swift's New York City home and taking a nap.\n\nPolice sources tell News 4 the man also allegedly took a shower and disturbed the pop star's bed after climbing through a window at her SoHo townhouse Friday afternoon. He was asleep when police investigating the case found him.\n\nThe man, 22-year-old Roger Alvardo, was charged with stalking, burglary, criminal mischief and trespassing, according to the NYPD.\n\nAccording to the Daily News, which first reported the break-in, it wasn't Alvardo's first arrest at Swift's home. He was also reportedly arrested for trying to break into the Franklin Street townhouse with a shovel in February.\n\nAlvardo's arrest Friday marks the fourth time in three weeks a man had been cuffed at one of the \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" singer's properties.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Colorado man wearing a mask and rubber gloves was cuffed outside her home in Beverly Hills. In that instance, the man was arrested on stalking charges and had a knife, rope, ammunition, more masks and gloves and prescription drugs in the car. Swift wasn't home at the time.\n\nThat incident followed the April 8 arrest of a homeless man on suspicion of trespassing after he tried to climb a wall at the same property and ignored warnings by security guards to leave.\n\nAnd on April 4, authorities said a Connecticut man with a crush on the singer allegedly robbed a bank and went to her Rhode Island mansion and threw the money he stole over a fence in an attempt to impress her.\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC Southern California", "images": ["https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/620*349/GettyImages-07122.jpg", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/652*367/Man_Breaks_into_Taylor_Swift_s_NYC_Home_and_Naps.jpg", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/KVEA.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/nbc-ajax-loader.gif", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/logo_la_2x.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/images/tve-play-icon.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/swiftAP_18107789738754.jpg", "https://s.clickability.com/s?19=990&14=0&6=480434403&7=1340521&25=0&18=0.6771638438594353", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=836588206435122&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/ots-double-arrow.png", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/designimages/ots_light_wx_85.png"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/swiftAP_18107789738754.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcbayarea.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Taylor-Swift-Home-Soho-Broken-Into-NYC-Police-NYPD-Sources-Nap-Shower-480434403.html", "title": "Man Breaks into Taylor Swift's Home, Showers & Naps: Sources", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140, user-scalable=yes", "twitter": {"account_id": 17379685, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nbcla", "creator": "@nbcla", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Taylor-Swift-Home-Soho-Broken-Into-NYC-Police-NYPD-Sources-Nap-Shower-480434403.html", "title": "Man Breaks into Taylor Swift's Home, Showers & Naps: Sources", "description": "A Florida man allegedly climbed through a window into Taylor Swift's SoHo townhouse, took a shower, disturbed her bed and then took a nap Friday, police sources tell News 4.", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/swiftAP_18107789738754.jpg?ak=bc"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361, "pages": 90240021027}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "A Florida man allegedly climbed through a window into Taylor Swift's SoHo townhouse, took a shower, disturbed her bed and then took a nap Friday, police sources tell News 4.", "title": "Man Breaks into Taylor Swift's Home, Showers & Naps: Sources", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Taylor-Swift-Home-Soho-Broken-Into-NYC-Police-NYPD-Sources-Nap-Shower-480434403.html", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/swiftAP_18107789738754.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Universal,HTML5", "preferredFormats": "m3u,mpeg4,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "keywords": "Taylor Swift, home invasion, new york city, soho,", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.description": "A Florida man allegedly climbed through a window into Taylor Swift's SoHo townhouse, took a shower, disturbed her bed and then took a nap Friday, police sources tell News 4.", "description": "A Florida man allegedly climbed through a window into Taylor Swift's SoHo townhouse, took a shower, disturbed her bed and then took a nap Friday, police sources tell News 4.", "sailthru.tags": "Taylor Swift, home invasion, new york city, soho,", "news_keywords": "Taylor Swift, home invasion, new york city, soho,", "sailthru.title": "Man Breaks into Taylor Swift's Home, Showers & Naps: Sources", "title": "Man Breaks into Taylor Swift's Home, Showers & Naps: Sources", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-21 04:55:26", "taboola_lead": "video"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524300926.0, "source": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com", "summary": ""}
