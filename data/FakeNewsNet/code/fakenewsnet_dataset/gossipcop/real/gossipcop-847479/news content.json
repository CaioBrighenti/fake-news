The Shades of Blue actress wore a pastel blue Valentino cape gown with massive Harry Winston diamond hoop earrings and a Judith Leiber Couture clutch, looking classier than ever.\n\nThe Bronx-born actress, singer and dancer had her new beau, former Yankee Alex Rodriguez, in tow wearing a tuxedo by Tom Ford, marking the couple\u2019s first red carpet appearance since going public with their relationship in April. The couple looked happy in love on the red carpet, which doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise since the two look like they\u2019re on cloud nine each time they\u2019re spotted out together.\n\nImage zoom Neilson Barnard/Getty\n\nLopez shared a selfie of the couple on Instagram on the way to Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s annual gala. \u201cMe and my macho bello\u2026 #metball2017 #Valentino,\u201d she wrote.\n\nJust a week ago, Jenny from the Block proclaimed her love for the Bronx Bomber on Instagram, sharing a photo of him post-home run with the caption, \u201cWow!! #beastmode #bronx #latino #goat\u201d (by \u201cgoat\u201d she means \u201cgreatest of all time,\u201d a popular acronym used on social media).\n\nIn previous years, the glam goddess never played it safe with her looks, which ranged from a stunning custom nude one-shoulder Atelier Versace illusion gown in 2015 to a semi-mohawk pompadour hairstyle for 2013\u2019s punk theme worn with a reptile-print Michael Kors gown.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Make Your Inner J.Lo Proud with These Larger than Life Hoops\n\n\u201cWhenever you see a picture of Jennifer, the handbag matches, the shoes work and the hair is perfect for the look she\u2019s doing,\u201d the Shades of Blue star\u2019s stylist Rob Zangardi previously told PEOPLE. \u201cShe always gets excited about bright colors, because they flatter her complexion.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nIn Lopez\u2019s earlier years at the Met Gala, the star kept her looks more conservative, instead opting for more classic, Old Hollywood vibes, including Marilyn Monroe-inspired hair looks in 2007 and 2008.\n\nImage zoom Getty(4)\n\nAnd it looks like she\u2019s definitely returning to that retro style this year.\n\nDo you love J.Lo\u2019s Met Gala look this year?
