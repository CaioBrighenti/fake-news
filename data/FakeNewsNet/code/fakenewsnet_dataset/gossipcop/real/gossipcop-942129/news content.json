I don\u2019t know, something inside me, I\u2019m competitive. When we work out I think, \u2018I can beat you,\u2019\u201d she said of her athlete beau. \u201cWe never challenge each other side-by-side. Like, if we go to UCLA, and we\u2019re doing the stairs or something, in my mind, I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m killing it.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Lopez, 48, noted that Rodriguez, 42, is careful not to participate in her competitions.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, he just doesn\u2019t even entertain my delusions,\u201d she explained. \u201cLike, I\u2019ll say, \u2018Babe, I feel like I could beat you.\u2019 And he\u2019s like [straight-faced].\u201d\n\nKimmel pointed out that Rodriguez was making a smart move in ignoring her challenges, which the \u201cDinero\u201d singer agreed with.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no winning that because if he beats me, it\u2019s over!\u201d she quipped, laughing.\n\nJokes aside, the couple, who have been publicly dating for more than a year, are stronger than ever. Lopez opened up about attending the games her man commentates.\n\n\u201cI like going! He comes to all my shows in Vegas,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what I do? I get the little feed in my ear so I can hear him calling the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, you guys really are in love!\u201d Kimmel exclaimed, which prompted a laugh from the singer.\n\n\u201cWe are!\u201d she agreed.\n\nJ.Lo recently got competitive with both Justin Timberlake and Bruno Mars.
