A mysterious woman was spotted carrying a bouquet of pink, purple and blue flowers with two giant baby foot-shaped pink and blue balloons at a Los Angeles hospital on Friday, E! News reported. The balloons read, \"Baby Girl\" and \"Baby Boy.\"\n\nBlue and pink balloons for \"B & J\" were delivered to a Los Angeles hospital amid Beyonc birth speculation. https://t.co/4Wc89kZKLS pic.twitter.com/0il0oehXB5 \u2014 E! News (@enews) June 17, 2017\n\nAn eyewitness saw the woman walk into the front of the building, then get back into her car and drive into an underground parking lot. Five mintues later she left without the flowers.\n\nSure, the woman could've been visiting anyone but there's one major clue that indicates she was there for Queen B.\n\nAlong with the gift was a card that read, \"B & J.\" If that doesn't convince you, you can click on for more proof.\n\nUPDATE (6/16/17 at 8:25 a.m. ET): The rapper skipped the Songwriters Hall of Fame ceremony in New York City on Thursday, June 15, amid speculation Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s already given birth!\n\nIn fact, the award was picked up by his friend Jon Platt.\n\n\n\n\"I can't begin to tell you how much this award means to Jay. He's really sorry he can't be here with you tonight,\" he told the crowd.\n\nThough Jay didn\u2019t make an appearance, Barack Obama introduced the \u201cEmpire State of Mind\u201d hitmaker in a video. While the speech is incredibly thoughtful, many fans believe our former POTUS may have accidentally revealed the sex of Bey and Jay\u2019s twins!\n\nPresident Obama says, \u201cJay and I are also fools for our daughters. Although he\u2019s going to have me beat once those twins show up.\u201d\n\nHere's what the dropbox link @S_C_ posted.\n\n(My President) Obama inducting Jay into the Songwriters Hall of Fame pic.twitter.com/BVY7nVyDtz New Life (@LordBalvin) June 16, 2017\n\nUh oh, do you think he just spilled the beans?! Are Bey and Jay have two more girls?\n\nBey's sister, Solange Knowles, was also reportedly spotted at a Los Angeles hospital, which of course sent fans into a frenzy. Do you think the twins are already here?\n\nClick on for more details!\n\nOriginal Story (6/14/17 at 12:15 p.m. ET): Rumors have circulated over the past few weeks that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z are going the extra mile when it comes to the birth to their twins, even building their own maternity ward in-house. A new report claims, however, that the couple are ready to welcome the newest Carter kids just as they did Blue Ivy, as friends and family of the celebrity couple have been spotted at a Los Angeles hospital.\n\nFriends of Bey and Hov were reportedly seen at an L.A. medical facility last night, June 13, according to sources at HollywoodLife. Those same close friends were reportedly seen carrying evidence that proves the 35-year-old songstress may literally be in labor as we speak.\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\n\u201cBeyonce\u2019s security was seen leaving her Beverly Hills home this morning carrying two baby seats to the same hospital in West LA.\n\n\u201cBey and Jay\u2019s large security team, including three well-staffed Escalades, are now waiting outside the hospital for the arrival of the twins.\u201d\n\nWhile all signs point to the twins arriving any minute now, Queen Bey and hubby Jay are pros when it comes to keeping things under wraps.\n\nSome believe the hospital trip could have been a false alarm, a common occurrence for women in their third trimester.\n\nCredit: Tidal\n\nStill, Beyonce\u2019s official due date was June 12, just one day before her crew was spotted on the scene.\n\nCredit: Beyonce.com", "images": ["http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18513979_127033501197412_8486791630991392768_n-1024x759.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-blue-ivy-zoom-0fbd5eef-e788-4476-9236-9ff5cd5e84af.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21149338_757212517791923_6938295666963644416_n-320x223.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-20-at-9.50.48-AM-320x223.png", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-635001998.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/26152787_1896505867329996_8668809372878503936_n-320x223.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-519451536-320x223-1495779173.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-zoom-55a7c33d-705a-429c-bdf8-a799cb1eb7f1-640x480-1497449741.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-wearable-art-683x1024.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21041889_254812198371809_8175695720834138112_n-320x223.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/loading.gif", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/imageedit_18_7537359122.png", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-zoom-55a7c33d-705a-429c-bdf8-a799cb1eb7f1.jpg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/wetpaint.svg", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jayyy.png", "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nick-carter-sexual-assault-320x223-1509372738.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-zoom-55a7c33d-705a-429c-bdf8-a799cb1eb7f1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "http://www.wetpaint.com/beyonce-in-labor-la-hospital-1597794/", "title": "Mysterious Woman Possibly Dropped Off Beyonc\u00e9 Baby Gifts at Los Angeles Hospital (UPDATE)", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/screenshot.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "Could Beyonce be in labor with her twins as we speak?
