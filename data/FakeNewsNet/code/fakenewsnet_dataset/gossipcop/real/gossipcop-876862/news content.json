The athlete called in her beloved glam squad to Hawaii to help her primp ahead of her intimate backyard wedding to MMA fighter Travis Browne. Her goal, while using longtime makeup artist Hee Soo, was to put forth a fresh, barely-there makeup look.\n\n\u201cShe really didn\u2019t have a lot on,\u201d Soo told E! News this week. \u201cShe is an athlete. They tend to have really beautiful skin because they sweat and work out so much. Your natural sweat cleans out your pores.\u201d\n\nAlong with her no-frills wedding, Rousey wanted a similar vibe for her hair and makeup. The bride, who looked resplendent in a Galia Lahav couture gown, opted for a simple textured bun crafted by her longtime hairstylist Abraham Esparza before sitting down with Soo.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018no-makeup makeup look\u2019 was easy because she had a little tan,\u201d she continued. Below, see the steps that the makeup artist took to achieve Rousey\u2019s fresh face.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrep the Skin\n\nSoo started by using an exfoliator by Fresh on Rousey\u2019s clean face. She then applied every beauty buff\u2019s favorite Cr\u00e8me de la Mer by La Mer, followed by an eye cream by Cl\u00e9 de Peau.\n\nLa Mer Cr\u00e8me de la Mer, 1 oz, $170, Sephora.com\n\nApply Foundation\n\nContinuing on with the Cl\u00e9 de Peau products, Soo then applied a foundation by the luxury beauty company that melted into Rousey\u2019s tan skin tone.\n\nEnhance the Eyes\n\nSoo went light around Rousey\u2019s eyes to enhance the bride\u2019s gray pigmentation. The artist used an orange eyeshadow by Stila to draw out Rousey\u2019s feature followed by a smudge of sheer nude in the corners.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Waterproof Mascara\n\nSoo has been on Rousey\u2019s team for years, so it only made sense that she knew the day would be filled with tears and a plethora of emotions. Hence, why the pro went for a waterproof mascara that would stay put. \u201cI knew her and Travis were going to be kissing a lot, so we wanted something that would not get everywhere and come off on him\u2014that and the crying,\u201d she told E! \u201cHer makeup looks so good because I do a lot of prep on her face beforehand.\u201d\n\nPop the Pout\n\nThe makeup pro decided to go for color on Rousey\u2019s lips, using a By Terry lip balm in the Berry color. \u201c[It] makes you look like you just bit into a bunch of cherries,\u201d Soo said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the barely-there makeup stayed put despite the heightened emotions. \u201cThere was lots of crying and happiness,\u201d Soo concluded. \u201cThe makeup lasted all day.\u201d\n\nRousey, meanwhile, took to Instagram to thank her glam squad for perfecting her wedding day look. \u201dThank you @thisisbabe @heeezooo @alejandroperazastyle for flying to the middle of the the Pacific Ocean to help me get ready,\u201d she said before adding an adorable shout-out to her husband. \u201cAnd thank you @travisbrownemma for choosing me every day forever #wrongmovesucka#YouGoinNowhere.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IENtVebWhqLZriSUmcmr8w--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/http://l.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-05-01/fa39e630-2ebb-11e7-aa78-5fd16111d955_TK_64x64-1-.png.cf.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dmj7bIUYR4BTe.2l589udg--~B/aD03Njg7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/the_knot_667/78aa1fbc8bded200d2f3b1c6b54ace9e", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YkDHk0Eg95Z6EYhj1ZQqWQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzY4O2g9NzY4/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/the_knot_667/78aa1fbc8bded200d2f3b1c6b54ace9e", "https://s.yimg.com/nn/lib/metro/DailyFantasy_BN_Baseball_300x250-min.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dmj7bIUYR4BTe.2l589udg--~B/aD03Njg7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/the_knot_667/78aa1fbc8bded200d2f3b1c6b54ace9e", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Esther Lee"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ronda-rousey-makeup-artist-explains-145215136.html", "title": "Ronda Rousey\u2019s Makeup Artist Explains How to Achieve Her Wedding Day Beauty Look", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooLifestyle", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "UFC fighter Ronda Rousey put her best face forward on her wedding day.
