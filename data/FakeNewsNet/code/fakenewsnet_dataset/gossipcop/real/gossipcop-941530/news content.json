In the book, and in her interviews, the late writer and actress spoke of a three-month-long affair she\u2019d had with Harrison Ford on the set of Star Wars, when she was 19 and he was a 33-year-old married father of two. In his new book, My Girls: A Lifetime with Carrie and Debbie, Todd Fisher, Carrie\u2019s younger brother, writes that his sister regretted telling the story of her Star Wars tryst.\n\nIn November 2016, Carrie told People, \u201cIt was so intense. It was Han and Leia during the week, and Carrie and Harrison during the weekend.\u201d Per the Daily Mail, Todd writes that his mother, Debbie Reynolds, had no idea about the affair before Carrie shared it with the world, and her disapproval made Carrie regret sharing it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t have told that story,\u201d Carrie later told their mother, according to Todd.\n\nCarrie and Reynolds, who died one day apart at the end of 2016, had a complicated relationship, as anyone who\u2019s seen Postcards from the Edge will understand. Todd writes that also in the last few months of 2016, Carrie was angry at her mother for trying to plan a lavish 60th birthday party for her. Carrie was in London filming Star Wars: The Last Jedi while promoting her book, and didn\u2019t have time to come back to L.A. for a party.\n\nReynolds, who had a stroke the previous year, was throwing herself into the planning of the party, so Carrie was eventually convinced to come back.\n\n\u201cShe was so beautiful, and of course I dreamed of one day looking like her,\u201d Fisher wrote in her memoir, Wishful Drinking. \u201cIt was then that I knew with the profound certainty of a ten year old that I would not be, and was in no way now, the beauty that my mother was. I was a clumsy-looking and intensely awkward, insecure girl . . . I decided then that I\u2019d better develop something else\u2014if I wasn\u2019t going to be pretty, maybe I could be funny or smart.\u201d\n\nPer the Mail, Todd writes that, in another example of intense love and dedication, his mother wanted to die with Carrie: \u201cDebbie Reynolds willed herself right off this planet to personally see to it that Carrie would never be alone.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa26e80080bdc6f6f918ba3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Goldie%252520Hawn%252520and%252520Kate%252520Hudson.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e63f61cf5654108f85f23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Carrie-Billie-Tribute.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578a34765321e4a464ac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b16935b91e32518d7caaaeb/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/carrie-fisher-harrison-ford-story.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa26e89c383e462ef1b924d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lauren%252520Bacall%252520with%252520her%252520children%252520Stephen%252520and%252520Leslie.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d00d2faef4f5d685d3a408e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Tibi%2520RS18%25200909.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa26ff29005767bcf9afb8c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hepburn%252520and%252520son%252520Sean.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d05048028d8add457470b77/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-stonewall-pride.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d080c72ef4f5d55083a4116/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lady-gagas-a-star-is-born.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b16935b91e32518d7caaaeb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie-fisher-harrison-ford-story.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d28d1945438e40008b3be93/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/BANKS_3_Steph-Wilson.png"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b16935b91e32518d7caaaeb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie-fisher-harrison-ford-story.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Annie Leibovitz", "David Kamp", "Hilary Weaver", "Laura Bradley", "Ilana Kaplan", "Hilary Weave", "Kevin Fitzpatrick"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/06/carrie-fisher-regretted-revealing-affair-with-harrison-ford", "title": "Carrie Fisher Regretted Revealing Her Affair with Harrison Ford", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "In a new book, Todd Fisher writes about his mother and sister\u2019s complex relationship and final days.", "keywords": "carrie fisher,todd fisher,debbie reynolds,star wars,harrison ford", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "In a new book, Todd Fisher writes about his mother and sister\u2019s complex relationship and final days.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b16935b91e32518d7caaaeb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie-fisher-harrison-ford-story.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Carrie Fisher Regretted Revealing Her Affair with Harrison Ford", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/06/carrie-fisher-regretted-revealing-affair-with-harrison-ford"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In a new book, Todd Fisher writes about his mother and sister\u2019s complex relationship and final days.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b16935b91e32518d7caaaeb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie-fisher-harrison-ford-story.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Carrie Fisher Regretted Revealing Her Affair with Harrison Ford"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
