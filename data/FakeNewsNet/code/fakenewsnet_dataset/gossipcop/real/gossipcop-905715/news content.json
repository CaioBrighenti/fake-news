Khloe Kardashian calls out a \u2018Revenge Body\u2019 contestant for some fake tears in the upcoming episode! Take a peek!\n\nKhloe Kardashian hasn\u2019t got time for the fake drama! The stunning reality star sits down with a new contestant named Joel in a promo for the next episode of Revenge Body with Khloe Kardashian where he admits that he wants to get in shape to get back at his ex-boyfriend Jose who did him wrong despite all the support Joel showed him. \u201cI was always there when he needed me in the hospital. I was with him during the whole leukemia thing and he doesn\u2019t even care about me,\u201d he tells KoKo. That\u2019s when she shuts him down!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about a hot body. My show is about mind, body and soul and really changing people from within and realizing that there\u2019s so much more to life than just an exterior,\u201d she tells Joel. He responds that revenge is just part of it, he\u2019s also struggling to get his confidence back after that toxic relationship. When Khloe asks him what really motivates him, he breaks down \u2014 except she isn\u2019t buying it! \u201cYou don\u2019t have to fake cry just cause I said that. The tear was perfectly acting,\u201d she responds. Yowza! Head here for loads more images of Khloe!\n\nFans of the fitspo queen know that she takes no prisoners when it comes to living healthy and staying active, even while pregnant with her and Tristan Thompson\u2018s, 26, first child! Naturally, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was bombarded with flak for refusing to slow down! But KoKo doesn\u2019t put up with that nonsense either! \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre to me that people don\u2019t want me to be happy and stay healthy and fit,\u201d Kardashian told Entertainment Tonight on Jan. 4. \u201cMy doctor wants me to work out everyday if I could, so I\u2019m doing doctor\u2019s orders and I feel good.\u201d Revenge Body airs at 10 p.m. EST on Sundays and Mondays on E!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think? Are you loving or loathing Khloe\u2019s response to Joel\u2019s breakdown?
