And the Southern Charm mom was certainly feeling the pressure of having to relive every moment viewers watched of her life during last season's sit-down. So when it came time to film the Season 4 reunion, she went into the event with a very different mind frame.\n\n\"I\u2019m hoping to express a little less than I did last year, but you know. I don\u2019t know; I\u2019m just hoping that people can see that through out all of this you can\u2019t make me tick. That is what people push me to do,\" she explained to The Daily Dish. \"They\u2019re waiting on me to stress out enough to where I crack or something. And I want to show them that they can\u2019t do that anymore.\"\n\nPart 1 of the Season 4 reunion put Kathryn in the hot seat, with the Charleston native having to open up about why she went to rehab as well as her life as a mom (she has two kids with ex, Thomas Ravenel) and her former friendship with Jennifer Snowden. And she knew that when it came to having to face the tough questions and issues, she wanted to deal with it in a different way than she's done in the past. \"So, they\u2019re probably expecting \u2014 or not knowing what to expect when they see me, but that\u2019s a good thing 'cause I\u2019m gonna surprise them I think,\" she said.\n\nAs for last year's outfit, well, Kathryn doesn't look to fondly on that. \"Fashion, what is it? Flop. Ugh, it was bad, but I mean it was cute but all in a different outfit,\" she reflected. \"Like the top with something else, the bottom with something else. I don\u2019t know. But this year I love my dress. It\u2019s like badass basically is what I\u2019m trying to get at.\"\n\nKathryn at the Season 4 reunion vs. Kathryn at the Season 3 reunion.\n\nCheck out Part 2 of the reunion next Monday at 8/7c.
