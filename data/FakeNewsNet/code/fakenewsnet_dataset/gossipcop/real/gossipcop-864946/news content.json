But it\u2019s the subject matter that\u2019s gotten everyone\u2019s attention. In the letter to Madonna, Tupac admitted that he ended their relationship because she\u2019s white.\n\n\u201cFor you to be seen with a black man wouldn\u2019t in any way jeopardize your career,\u201d he confessed in the letter, dated Jan. 15, 1995. \u201cIf anything it would make you seem that much more open and exciting.\n\n\u201cBut for me at least in my previous perception I felt due to my \u2018image\u2019 I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was,\u201d he continued.\n\nTupac goes on to write that he never meant to hurt Madonna, and explained his reasoning even further.\n\nAs you can see I have grown both spiritually and mentally. It no longer matters how I\u2019m perceived. Please understand my previous position as that of a young man with limited experience with a extremely famous sex symbol. I offer my friendship once again time this time much stronger and focused. If you are still interested I would like to further discuss this with you but some of it couldn\u2019t wait. I felt compelled to tell you \u2026 just in case anything happened to 2 me.\n\nAt the end of the letter, Tupac asked the singer to visit him in jail.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you feel about visiting me but if you could find it in your heart I would love to speak face to face with you. It\u2019s funny but this experience has taught me not to take time for granted,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadonna confirmed their relationship in 2015 in an interview with Howard Stern and said that she was introduced to Tupac by Rosie Perez.\n\nThe last Tupac prison letter sold for more than $170,000.
