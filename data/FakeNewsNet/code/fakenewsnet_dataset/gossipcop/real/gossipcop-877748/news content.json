{"url": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-joe-alwyn-harry-styles-inspiration/", "text": "Taylor Swift dropped the second song off her upcoming album Reputation on Sunday morning, causing a massive debate amongst her Swifties on social media over the inspiration behind \u201c\u2026Ready for It.\u201d\n\nMany immediately went wild for the catchy tune (read the full lyrics here) saying it was written about her boyfriend Joe Alwyn, whom Swift has been dating since late last year.\n\n\u201cSome boys are trying too hard / He don\u2019t try at all though / Younger than my exes but he acts like such a man, though,\u201d sings Swift, 27, on the track.\n\nAlwyn, 26, is seven years younger than Calvin Harris and 10 years younger than Tom Hiddleston, whom Swift dated before the British actor.\n\nWait, is Ready For It actually about her current boyfriend, Joe? Because \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Caitlin Rantala (@caitlinrantala) September 3, 2017\n\nIt sounds like \u2026Ready For It? is about Joe Awlyn and @taylorswift13 and I'm about to scream because it's too cute \u2014 Brainiac (@Perspicax_) September 3, 2017\n\nI love the fact that #ReadyForIt is about Joe Alwyn. It's Taylor's way to introduce us to him \u2014 Lola Foura (@OlgaFoura) September 3, 2017\n\nI bet my pennies that this is about joe alwyn, but this also means Taylor's really happy in her relationship!!!! I'm so happy she's happy \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 https://t.co/pKK6wt6zzw \u2014 fran (@centuryswift) September 3, 2017\n\nJust as many fans, however, are positive the song was inspired by Harry Styles. Though she\u2019s never confirmed the rumors, many believe her hit songs \u201cStyle\u201d and \u201cOut of the Woods\u201d off her 1989 album were written about the former One Direction singer, who is 23 years old.\n\nStyles\u2019 song \u201cTwo Ghosts\u201d off his recent solo album is rumored to be a direct response to Swift\u2019s \u201cStyle\u201d because of his lyrics \u201cSame lips red, same eyes blue / Same white shirt, couple more tattoos.\u201d In \u201cStyle,\u201d she sings \u201cI got that red lip, classic thing that you like \u2026 You got that long hair slicked back, white T-shirt.\u201d\n\ntaylor swift's ready for it is yet another bop about harry styles and no one can tell me otherwise \u2014 Jess (@BettyxJug) September 3, 2017\n\nHi @Harry_Styles, Tay Tay just gave you an answer for \"Two Ghosts\".

Just hours after releasing \u201c\u2026Ready for It,\u201d the singer kicked herself out of the top spot on the U.S. iTunes chart where her scathing single \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d had been sitting at number one.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/pride-18.jpg?crop=120px%2C284px%2C873px%2C458px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/scooter-braun.jpg?crop=227px%2C119px%2C2246px%2C1178px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tiamowry_pub.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/taylor-swift-9.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/wp-4split-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/scooter-braun-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/taylor-swift.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1431px%2C751.275px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sia-taylor-swift.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/gettyimages-1138972078.jpg?crop=0px%2C79px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/taylor-swift-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/taylor-swift.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/taylor-swift.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/taylor-swift-8.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/braun-swift-1-2000x1333a.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/scooter.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/taylor-swift-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/taylor-swift-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/taylor-swift-1-2000.jpg?crop=70px%2C351px%2C1351px%2C709px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/harry-styles-split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/taylor-swift-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-joe-alwyn-harry-styles-inspiration/", "title": "Is Taylor Swift's '...Ready for It' About Joe Alwyn or Harry Styles?
