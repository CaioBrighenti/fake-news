Lovato and Aguilera have been teasing a duet for quite some time, with the track finally coming to fruition on Aguilera's forthcoming album, Liberation (due June 15), which the Billboard cover star announced last week.\n\nAguilera and Lovato join an already star-studded roster of performers for the 2018 Billboard Music Awards, which include Ariana Grande (who will open the show), Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello, Dua Lipa, John Legend, Kelly Clarkson and BTS. The K-pop superstars will also be premiering a song, performing a track from their forthcoming album Love Yourself: Tear that will drop two days before the May 20 show.\n\nClarkson will host the 2018 Billboard Music Awards, which will broadcast live from MGM Grand Garden Arena on Sunday, May 20 at 8 p.m. ET /5 p.m. PT.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/demi-lovato-performance-2017-june-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/2018-BBMAs-recirc.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/demi-lovato-performance-2017-june-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8455055/demi-lovato-christina-aguilera-collaboration-debut-billboard-music-awards-2018-performers", "title": "Demi Lovato & Christina Aguilera to Debut New Collaboration at 2018 Billboard Music Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Demi Lovato & Christina Aguilera to Perform at 2018 Billboard Music Awards", "description": "The pop divas will debut their highly anticipated collaboration \"Fall In Line\" on the show, as they each announced on their social media Tuesday morning (May 8).", "og": {"title": "Demi Lovato & Christina Aguilera to Debut New Collaboration at 2018 Billboard Music Awards", "description": "The pop divas will debut their highly anticipated collaboration \"Fall In Line\" on the show, as they each announced on their social media Tuesday morning (May 8).", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/demi-lovato-performance-2017-june-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8455055/demi-lovato-christina-aguilera-collaboration-debut-billboard-music-awards-2018-performers", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8455055/demi-lovato-christina-aguilera-collaboration-debut-billboard-music-awards-2018-performers", "title": "Demi Lovato & Christina Aguilera to Debut New Collaboration at 2018 Billboard Music Awards", "description": "The pop divas will debut their highly anticipated collaboration \"Fall In Line\" on the show, as they each announced on their social media Tuesday morning (May 8).", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/demi-lovato-performance-2017-june-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
