Winona Ryder, for example, couldn't hear parts of an acceptance speech while on stage with the cast of Stranger Things at the SAG Awards, leading her to make faces that people interpreted as, well, strange \u2014 but people didn't know the reasonable explanation until later. And Dakota Johnson was recently said to be side-eyeing Angelina Jolie during Jennifer Aniston's Golden Globes speech, but the Fifty Shades actress explained that she really was trying to get a good look at her favorite actors from Stranger Things, who were seated at another table.\n\nSuch is the case with Zendaya, who some thought was scowling at Blake Lively and Emily Blunt while they were all sitting together at the Michael Kors runway show at New York Fashion Week.\n\nExcept she wasn't. She was just trying to get a good look at the fashion!\n\n\"I was looking at the runway,\" she tweet-shouted.\n\nNow that's cleared up.", "images":
