Yikes,\u201d a fan commented on a photo the Live With Kelly and Ryan account posted promoting the episode. Ripa quipped back, \u201cYou\u2019re being generous.\u201d\n\nThe Emmy winner didn\u2019t hold back from calling Luyendyk out for his controversial actions during his visit to the show. \u201cI want to understand everything,\u201d she told the race car driver, who broke up with his season 22 Bachelor winner, Becca Kufrin, and proposed to his runner-up, 26-year-old Burnham, on After the Final Rose on Tuesday, March 6. \u201cWhat are you thinking? How did this happen? Were you as shady as I think you are now?\u201d\n\nLuyendyk kept his cool as he explained that he \u201cof course\u201d felt pressure to propose to Kufrin on the finale, which aired on Monday, March 5. \u201cLauren had trouble opening up on the show a little bit and our relationship developed late and I was always sort of vying for her affection,\u201d the real estate agent told Ripa and Seacrest, 43.\n\n\u201cI had a hard time expressing myself to him. I feel like i take some of the credit for that too,\u201d Burnham chimed in. Added Luyendyk, \u201cI think toward the end, as the Bachelor, you say, \u2018This is the day I have to make a decision.\u2019 And I really tried to think logically about it and I shouldn\u2019t have proposed on that day.\u201d\n\nThe Scottsdale native then recalled reaching out to the tech saleswoman on New Year\u2019s Eve. \u201cI asked Becca\u2019s permission for that. From the beginning of our engagement I said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m having a tough time, that breakup was very difficult for me.\u2019 And she could tell I had one foot in that relationship and I was never fully in that relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cSo she was being very supportive and saying, \u2018If you need to reach out to get closure or to either move forward with that.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs for their plans for the future? \u201cI felt like we should get a little break from this so we\u2019re going on vacation,\u201d Luyendyk announced. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to do regular couple things. And then after that we\u2019re going to Virginia Beach and we\u2019re gonna pack up her car and her dog, Dallas, and drive all the way to Phoenix. She\u2019s moving to Phoenix.\u201d\n\nThe Virigina Beach native and the former bearer of red roses found their happy ending, and Kufin, 27, is preparing to start an exciting new chapter as the season 14 star of The Bachelorette.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kelly-ripa-lauren-arie.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kelly-ripa-lauren-arie.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kelly-ripa-lauren-arie.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kelly-ripa-shades-arie-luyendyk-jr-and-lauren-burnhams-relationship/", "title": "Kelly Ripa Shades Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham\u2019s Relationship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kelly Ripa isn\u2019t confident that Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham\u2019s relationship will last after the pair got engaged on \u2018After the Final Rose\u2019 \u2014 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Did Kelly Ripa Just Shade The Bachelor\u2019s Arie and Lauren?", "description": "Kelly Ripa isn\u2019t confident that Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham\u2019s relationship will last after the pair got engaged on \u2018After the Final Rose\u2019 \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kelly-ripa-shades-arie-luyendyk-jr-and-lauren-burnhams-relationship/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kelly-ripa-lauren-arie.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kelly-ripa-lauren-arie.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Kelly Ripa, Lauren B., and Arie"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelor", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-07T18:41:48+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kelly Ripa isn\u2019t confident that Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham\u2019s relationship will last after the pair got engaged on \u2018After the Final Rose\u2019 \u2014 find out more", "title": "Did Kelly Ripa Just Shade The Bachelor\u2019s Arie and Lauren?", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kelly-ripa-lauren-arie.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520448108.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
