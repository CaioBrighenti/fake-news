E!\n\nThis season of \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" has only recently kicked off, but already, there's been major drama among the family \u2014 especially where the Kardashian women are involved. After many arguments between Khloe, Kim, and Kourtney have broken out, on Sunday night, Kourtney was wrapped up in the drama again, and this time, it was all about the family's holiday plans.\n\nBasically, the argument was about whether or not Scott Disick would be invited to Kris Jenner's annual Christmas party. The rest of the family thought that Disick should obviously be in attendance \u2014 even though he and Kourtney are no longer together, he's still Mason, Reign, and Penelope's father and part of their family.\n\nBut Kourtney wanted to bring boyfriend Younes Bendjima ( who she has since broken up with) and thought it might be awkward for him and Scott to be at the same party together\u2026 even though Scott swore it wasn't a big deal (for him, at least).\n\nKendall was totally on Kourtney's side, though, especially since Kris originally didn't want to invite Caitlyn Jenner because nobody at the party \"would even know how to respond to her,\" and of course, Kendall wanted to have both of her parents at the party, too.\n\nKendall and Kris butted heads about invites too. E!\n\nKourtney was torn between wanting Scott to be there for their kids and wanting to keep the peace between her ex and her boyfriend \u2026 and, of course, she felt like her family wasn't prioritizing her feelings if they'd invite Scott against her wishes.\n\n\"You didn't have a relationship with my dad for 25 years?\" Kendall asked her mother.\n\nIn the end, Caitlyn was invited \u2014 although she didn't actually show up.\n\nKourtney later confided to Kendall that she wasn't sure she wanted to attend the party because of the drama with her sisters and because of Scott.\n\nThe pair ended up working it out themselves.

If my boyfriend is going to the party, if you're there, I just don't want any disrespect,\" Kourtney told Scott. \"I've been feeling super anxious \u2026 but I don't want the kids to not have their dad there.\"\n\nUltimately, the party went off without a hitch and Kourtney and Scott both got to celebrate the holiday with their children.\n\n\"Not sharing this whole experience with my family and my kids, it wouldn't have felt right,\" Kourtney later said of her decision.\n\nYou can watch a clip of the drama below:\n\nFor more great stories, head to INSIDER's homepage.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b841fbc672e1620b660018f-750-563.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59c3c593ba785e36cd1448c7-1136-568.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59c3c593ba785e36cd1448c7-1136-568.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Pomarico"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/kardashian-scott-disick-christmas-2018-8", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian said she wanted Scott Disick to skip Christmas with her family because she was worried he would 'disrespect' her boyfriend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-08-27", "sailthru.date": "2018-08-27", "news_keywords": "Kardashians, KUWTK, The Kardashians, Kourtney Kardashian, Scott Disick, TV, Freelancer, Nicole Pomarico", "sailthru.tags": "Kardashians, KUWTK, The Kardashians, Kourtney Kardashian, Scott Disick, TV, Freelancer, Nicole Pomarico", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian revealed on \"Keeping up with the Kardashians\" that she was considering skipping Christmas with her family because of the fighting with her sisters.
