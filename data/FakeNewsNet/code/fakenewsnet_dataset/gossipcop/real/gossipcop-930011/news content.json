Four of the country star's first seven singles hit No. 1 on Country Airplay, with the other three reaching No. 2 on the chart. Along with owning the country radio market, Swindell has carved out a reputation as a rising live act, and he'll continue his Reason To Drink Tour with part two this fall: The Reason To Drink... Another Tour, which kicks off October 4 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, with Dustin Lynch and Lauren Alaina along for the trek.\n\nSwindell will be featuring some new music on his next tour, as his third album\u200b, All of It, arrives this Friday (Aug. 17). The singer has been teasing fans with videos for four of the set\u2019s songs: \u201cSomebody\u2019s Been Drinking,\u201d \u201cThe Ones Who Got Me Here,\u201d \u201cLove You Too Late,\u201d and the romantic title track. The video for \"All of It\" finishes the story arc that Swindell began in the first clip, and Billboard has an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how the visual came together.\n\nThe video -- which was released on Aug. 10 -- features Swindell in the kitchen cooking for his love interest, something that he hints may not actually happen off camera. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s on video, and we\u2019re not actually having to eat it,\u201d the singer quips while on set.\n\nWith \"All of It\" bringing an end to the storyline Swindell has created with his recent videos, the clip for the title track features the same girl from the singer's All of It video sequence, Alicia. Fans who have followed the storyline will take solace in the fact that the on-screen couple is together again at the end -- proving that sometimes, couples don\u2019t \u201cBreak Up In The End.\u201d\n\nSwindell will be performing some All of It tracks as part of Billboard\u2019s Facebook Live series later today (Aug. 15). Tune into Billboard's Facebook page at 3:30 pm ET, and in the meantime check out behind-the-scenes footage of \"All of it\" below.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/Cole-Swindell-2018-cr-Robby-Klein-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Cole-Swindell-2018-cr-Robby-Klein-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Cole-Swindell-2018-cr-Robby-Klein-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chuck Dauphin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8469916/cole-swindell-all-of-it-video-behind-the-scenes-clip", "title": "Cole Swindell Shows Fans How His 'All of It' Video Storyline Reached a Happy Ending: Exclusive", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Cole Swindell's 'All of It' Video: Watch a Behind-the-Scenes Clip", "description": "The video for \"All of It\" finishes the story arc that Swindell began in the first clip, and Billboard has an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how the visual came together.", "og": {"title": "Cole Swindell Shows Fans How His 'All of It' Video Storyline Reached a Happy Ending: Exclusive", "description": "The video for \"All of It\" finishes the story arc that Swindell began in the first clip, and Billboard has an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how the visual came together.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Cole-Swindell-2018-cr-Robby-Klein-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8469916/cole-swindell-all-of-it-video-behind-the-scenes-clip", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8469916/cole-swindell-all-of-it-video-behind-the-scenes-clip", "title": "Cole Swindell Shows Fans How His 'All of It' Video Storyline Reached a Happy Ending: Exclusive", "description": "The video for \"All of It\" finishes the story arc that Swindell began in the first clip, and Billboard has an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how the visual came together.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Cole-Swindell-2018-cr-Robby-Klein-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
