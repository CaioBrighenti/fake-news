The pair was granted joint legal custody of their children last summer, and in August, Drake-Lee requested sole physical custody of 4-year-old Sadie and 2-year-old Maceo.\n\nThe Grey's Anatomy star will have custody of the kids every other weekend and two days each week. He will also get the children on Father's Day. The court documents also outline different schedules when Grey's is and is not in production. Williams and Drake-Lee will alternate custody of their children on major holidays like Thanksgiving, Easter, the Fourth of July, as well as birthdays.\n\nThe document also states that the former couple are to \"communicate exclusively through OurFamilyWizard,\" a website designed as a communication tool for divorced or separated parents. According to the order, communicating via text message or phone is allowed \"in the event of an emergency.\"\n\nWilliams and Drake-Lee married in September 2012, after dating for five years. Williams filed for divorce in April 2017. In January, Williams agreed to pay Drake-Lee $50,695 per month in spousal support, and share half of any residuals received for his acting work between Sept. 1, 2012 and April 10, 2017.\n\nET has reached out to Williams' rep for comment.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJesse Williams Is the 'Happiest' He's Ever Been Amid Divorce Drama (Exclusive)\n\n\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy's' Jesse Williams Agrees to Pay More Than $50,000 in Monthly Spousal Support\n\nJesse Williams Responds to Estranged Wife Aryn Drake-Lee's Request for Sole Custody of Their Children", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x169/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1242911076001_5719664850001_5719652109001-vs.jpg?itok=Jbr7DvdR", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/ETO_TRENDING_CamilaShawn_071219vidpic2.png?itok=ORGgLcp8&h=59a3bc86", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-08/jesse_arya_101908982.jpg?itok=vU4TuDD1&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-06/gettyimages-958745538.jpg?itok=wlJ28kMj&h=87c7c3fc", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-08/jesse_arya_101908982.jpg?itok=kdCwV8Pv"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-08/jesse_arya_101908982.jpg?itok=kdCwV8Pv", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jesse-williams-awarded-joint-custody-of-children-in-divorce-99176", "title": "Jesse Williams Awarded Joint Custody of Children in Divorce", "meta_data": {"title": "Jesse Williams Awarded Joint Custody of Children in Divorce | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jesse-williams-awarded-joint-custody-of-children-in-divorce-99176", "title": "Jesse Williams Awarded Joint Custody of Children in Divorce", "description": "The actor's ex, Aryn Drake-Lee, requested sole custody last August.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-08/jesse_arya_101908982.jpg?itok=kdCwV8Pv", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The actor's ex, Aryn Drake-Lee, requested sole custody last August.", "title": "Jesse Williams Awarded Joint Custody of Children in Divorce", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jesse-williams-awarded-joint-custody-of-children-in-divorce-99176", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-08/jesse_arya_101908982.jpg?itok=kdCwV8Pv"}, "description": "The actor's ex, Aryn Drake-Lee, requested sole custody last August.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Jesse Williams, Splits", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Jesse Williams, Splits"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
