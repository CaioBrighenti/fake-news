Activism has become mainstream, and with that, many people have begun to voice their unique life perspectives and stories. Political opinions are being formed at younger and younger ages, and children learn from mimicking what they observe.\n\nSo where do these two ideas come together? Simply put, positive media for minorities, can provide a more positive outlook from the viewer. This isn't just speculation, one example of this happening is Modern Family. After the show increased in popularity, acceptance for two of the characters (being a married gay couple with an adopted daughter) had spiked as well.\n\nAs a member of the LGBT+ community, growing up, I didn't have many characters in the media that I could really identify with. However, now there are numerous diverse and complex LGBT+ characters, as well as some that even help educate about intersectionality.\n\nWhen I look to the younger generation, and see a new wave of activism and gender identity, I realize that these were the people raised with LGBT+ issues being a conversation. Activism isn't taboo anymore, and while there are many differing opinions, there is a dialogue in place that creates an LGBT+ space.\n\nWith normalization, comes acceptance, and with a very unstable political climate, acceptance matters now more than ever.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://odysseyonline-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F17407790%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/u19oGUMBff4zyzZ9/img.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=6GrUm1a4KM+2Io"], "top_img": "https://odysseyonline-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F17407790%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/u19oGUMBff4zyzZ9/img.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Ephlin", "Ian Dorbu", "Melissa Walcott", "Morgan Cotner", "Misha Davari", "Laneisha Jeans", "Matthew Gallo", "Joy Pauline", "Brittany Wilson", "Alexandra Giardina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theodysseyonline.com/why-now-more-than-ever-media-representation-matters", "title": "Why Now More Than Ever, Media Representation Matters", "meta_data": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Odyssey", "application-name": "Odyssey", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eb8e4e", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.rbl.ms/static/img/whitelabel/odysseyonline/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?1", "theme-color": "#647187", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@twitter", "id": 341251022}, "image": "https://assets.rbl.ms/17407790/980x.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 402984699895135, "pages": 208750362478342}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.theodysseyonline.com/why-now-more-than-ever-media-representation-matters", "site_name": "The Odyssey Online", "image": {"identifier": "https://odysseyonline-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F17407790%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/u19oGUMBff4zyzZ9/img.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 2000}, "description": "Normalization is the first step on a path to coexistence", "title": "Why Now More Than Ever, Media Representation Matters"}, "article": {"publisher": 208750362478342, "published_time": "2018-03-12T04:02:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-13T15:30:52+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/208750362478342"}, "referrer": "always", "description": "Why now more than ever, representation matters", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "ZYYz_eVjBcSpiEJtMePqpsn3V_ndAOj4r-aFAlL3jS8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520827321.0, "source": "https://www.theodysseyonline.com", "summary": ""}
