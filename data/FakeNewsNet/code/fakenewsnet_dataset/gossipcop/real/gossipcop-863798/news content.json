Drake made the scene in a black and white Tom Ford tuxedo, while Gold-Onwude, 30, opted for a strapless cherry-red gown, nude heels, and a gold clutch.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether or not the supremely photogenic pair are an item or just hoop-loving pals, here\u2019s everything you should know about Drake\u2019s NBA Awards date.\n\nShe\u2019s an Ivy Leaguer\n\nOriginally from Queens, New York, Gold-Onwude won two basketball state titles while attending Christ the King High School. Her skills netted her a basketball scholarship to California\u2019s Stanford University, where she was named Pac 10 Defensive Player of the Year and made three trips to the Final Four. Ultimately she decided to move from the court to courtside, transitioning into sports journalism before graduation.\n\nSports Journalism Is Not a Forever Gig\n\nThough she has an impressive resume\u2014her NBA coverage earned her an Emmy in 2015, and she was on the ground at the 2016 Rio Olympics\u2014Gold-Onwude has said she someday hopes to broaden her journalistic scope. \u201cOne of the biggest people I look up to is Robin Roberts. She started in sports and transcended out,\u201d she said in a recent interview with Bauce. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s something I could do one day\u2026Well, I\u2019m a regular girl from Queens. Basketball happened to be my vehicle that got me out of New York and all the way to California.\u201d\n\nShe Once Beat Out LeBron James in a \u201cPig\u201d Shoot-Out.\n\nSee for yourself! Gold-Onwude definitely has game.\n\nShe and Drake Have a Shared Heritage\n\nThough they have a lot in common, Gold-Onwude says she was intrigued by their shared family backgrounds. \u201cThe first thing was the connection because we\u2019re both black and Jewish,\u201d she told Respect Mag. \u201cMy father is Nigerian and my mom is white, Russian, Eastern European background and Jewish. So, you know, we have that in common.\u201d\n\nTheir Love of the Game Brought Them Together\n\nThe pair first became close back in December 2015, when they met up after a basketball game. The Golden State Warriors had beaten the Toronto Raptors\u2014Drake\u2019s hometown team\u2014but the rapper\u2019s spirits brightened when he saw Gold-Onwude. \u201cWhen the post game makes you forget about what happened during the actual game,\u201d he captioned a sweet Instagram photo of them together.\n\nFROM PEN: Grammy News and Notes: Album of the Year Nominees\n\nGold-Onwude later told Scoop B Radio that they initially bonded over (shocker!) basketball. \u201cHe\u2019s a big time basketball fan, we\u2019ve become friends through; just his passion for the game. He\u2019s come to a lot of games, he\u2019s become really good friends with Steph Curry and his family. So we met through that and every time he\u2019s around, it\u2019s always fun, jokes, laughter. It\u2019s a whole crew of us that\u2019ll end up hanging out together or seeing each other at these games. So it\u2019s been really cool to cultivate a friendship with him.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kane-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/drake.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C1500px%2C787px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/arrivals-79.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/nba-1.jpg?crop=100px%2C65px%2C1670px%2C877px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/mtv-movie-awards-2009-16.jpg?crop=0px%2C184px%2C2232px%2C1173px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cmt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/johnny-bananas.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1161456992.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rexfeatures_10317962a.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3203px%2C1681.575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/taraji-p-henson-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/brantley.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/keith-urban.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tout-2-14.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lucy-liu.jpg?crop=437px%2C23px%2C1309px%2C688px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/sebastian-maniscalco.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1345px%2C706.125px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/drake.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1186109172ae7e45e209053a86331e35?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://people.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1156597780.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2625px%2C1378.125px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/djkhaled2.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1156591933.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2501px%2C1313.025px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1161273233.jpg?crop=0px%2C164px%2C2666px%2C1400px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/drake.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C1500px%2C787px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jordan Runtagh"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/drake-rosalyn-gold-onwude-nba-awards-what-to-know/", "title": "Drake Brings Rosalyn Gold-Onwude to NBA Awards: What to Know About His Latest Date", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "drake, drake rapper, nba awards, drake nba awards, drake nba awards date, drake Rosalyn Gold-Onwude nba awards, Rosalyn Gold-Onwude reporter", "news_keywords": "drake, drake rapper, nba awards, drake nba awards, drake nba awards date, drake Rosalyn Gold-Onwude nba awards, Rosalyn Gold-Onwude reporter", "description": "Drake's NBA Awards date is a star reporter and athlete in her own right!
