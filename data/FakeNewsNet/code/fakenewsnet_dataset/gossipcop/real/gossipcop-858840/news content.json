Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) on his show \u201cReal Time.\u201d Maher was talking to Sasse about the senator\u2019s book, \u201cThe Vanishing American Adult,\u201d which explores why today\u2019s young people are unable to survive in a competitive global economy. The conversation drifted to Halloween and how dressing up is no longer just a children\u2019s tradition. Sasse said adults don\u2019t do that quite as much in his state because it\u2019s frowned upon. In response, Maher said he should visit Nebraska more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to have you work in the fields with us,\u201d Sasse said.\n\n\u201cWork in the fields? Senator, I\u2019m a house n\u2014\u2013,\u201d Maher said, raising both of his hands up. \u201cNo it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a joke.\u201d\n\nBill Maher just said the n word, @BenSasse didn't look horrified, and the audience applauded. pic.twitter.com/kFAs1S3dyM \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) June 3, 2017\n\nThe audience cheered. A smiling Sasse didn\u2019t say anything about the comments, and the conversation moved forward.\n\nIn a statement sent to media outlets, HBO called Maher\u2019s remarks \u201cinexcusable and tasteless\u201d and said the cable network will remove that segment from future airings of the show.\n\nBlack Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson and Jack Posobiec, a Trump supporter who wrote for the right-wing site Rebel Media, have called for Maher to be fired. #FireBillMaher is circulating on Twitter.\n\nAnd why did the audience think it was okay to laugh? And Ben Sasse doesn't even flinch. What is happening in the world? \u2014 deray (@deray) June 3, 2017\n\nOther personalities who\u2019ve weighed in, however, came to his defense. CNN host Larry King said he\u2019s been Maher\u2019s friend for years and assured \u201cthere\u2019s not a racist bone\u201d in the comedian\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s accept his apology and move on,\u201d King added.\n\nJust saw @billmaher \"racist joke\" and I have to say...fuck everybody who's pissed. Comedians save us, jokes. politicians kill us. Wars, laws \u2014 Christopher Titus (@TitusNation) June 3, 2017\n\nSinger-songwriter Duncan Sheik implored on Maher to learn from his mistake.\n\nI Love the @billmaher show and watch it \"religiously\". Bill, please see the error of your glib quip. Not remotely funny or cool, mate. \u2014 Duncan Sheik (@TheDuncanSheik) June 4, 2017\n\nSome turned to humor:\n\nToday is the day Bill Maher became president. \u2014 Michael Ian Black (@michaelianblack) June 3, 2017\n\n[Bill Maher\u2019s interview with a Trump defender started out nice. Then Russia came up.]\n\nSasse also was criticized for his reaction, or lack thereof. In a series of tweets Saturday, Sasse talked about how he should\u2019ve reacted.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I wish I\u2019d been quick enough to say in the moment: \u201cHold up, why would you think it\u2019s OK to use that word? The history of the n-word is an attack on universal human dignity. It\u2019s therefore an attack on the American Creed. Don\u2019t use it,\u201d Sasse wrote.\n\nBut he also said that he\u2019s a strong advocate of the First Amendment, and comedians \u201cget latitude to cross hard lines.\u201d\n\nAm walking off a redeye from LAX.\n\n3 reflections on @billmaher\n\n1.

Maher had defended his decision, saying inviting Yiannopoulos on his show brought his views under scrutiny, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn 2014, Maher was accused of hate speech when he said it\u2019s wrong to say only \u201ca few bad apples\u201d in the Muslim community have extremist beliefs.\n\nIslam is \u201cthe only religion that acts like the mafia, that will f\u2014\u2014 kill you if you say the wrong thing, draw the wrong picture, or write the wrong book,\u201d Maher said during an episode on \u201cReal Time\u201d with atheist scholar Sam Harris and actor Ben Affleck.\n\nFollowing his comments, students at the University of California in Berkeley petitioned to get Maher disinvited as a commencement speaker at a graduation in December 2014. Thousands signed an online petition calling his remarks bigoted and racist and pushing for Maher\u2019s removal as speaker.\n\nIn response to the students, Maher said he still planned to go.\n\nPlease @HBO Do Not Air Another Episode Of Real Time With Bill Maher. \u2014 Chance The Rapper Owbum \ud83d\udcc5 (@chancetherapper) June 3, 2017\n\n[\u2018He broke me\u2019: A defiant, tearful Kathy Griffin slams attacks by Trump and his family]\n\n\u201cWhoever told you you only had to hear what didn\u2019t upset you?\u201d Maher said, adding later: \u201cI promise this will be your day. This is a commencement speech. The issue is you \u2026 My reputation isn\u2019t on the line. Yours is.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, Maher apologized after a controversial comment he made on his ABC show prompted companies to pull their ads. In criticizing United States military action after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, he said, \u201cWe have been the cowards lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That\u2019s cowardly.\u201d\n\nMaher later said he was referring to the government, not to individual soldiers.\n\n\u201cIn no way was I intending to say, nor have I ever thought, that the men and women who defend our nation in uniform are anything but courageous and valiant, and I offer my apologies to anyone who took it wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nABC fired Maher afterward.\n\nCritics of Maher\u2019s most recent comments were quick to draw parallels between him and another comedian, Kathy Griffin, who was recently slammed for a photo of her holding a mask resembling President Trump\u2019s bloody, severed head.\n\nBill Maher and Kathy Griffin showed this week that racism can't be hidden as \"comedy\" and stupidity can't be hidden as \"art\". \u2014 Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) June 3, 2017\n\nGriffin has since removed the image and apologized, saying she went too far. But five employers had canceled shows, and CNN had fired Griffin from her longtime New Year\u2019s Eve co-host job.\n\nOn Friday, a defiant and tearful Griffin said that although she regretted the photo, she wasn\u2019t going to stop criticizing the president.\n\n\u201cA sitting president of the United States and his grown children and the first lady are personally trying to ruin my life forever,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cYou guys know him, he\u2019s not going to stop.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet addressing Maher and Griffin, Cornell William Brooks, president of the NAACP, said: \u201cGreat comedians make us think & laugh.
