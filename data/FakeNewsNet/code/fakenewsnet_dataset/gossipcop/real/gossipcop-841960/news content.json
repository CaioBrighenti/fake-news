Now, you can just drink it out of a forty.The container famous for malt liquor and cheap beer will now house the wine of summer. Imagine those games of \"Edward Fortyhands.\"Ros\u00e9 is having a bit of a kale moment right now as it enters the realm of millennial popularity along with unicorn food and poke.Between ros\u00e9 magnums, the rise of \"bros\u00e9\", and even ros\u00e9 Jell-O shots, it's clear that blush fever is in full effect.The 40-ounce bottle is cost effective. Most people spend around $15 to $20 for a traditional bottle of ros\u00e9 and those bottles only hold 750 milliliters, or about 25 ounces of wine. Since a forty holds nearly twice that amount, they end up being quite a deal. These have been selling for just $16.Just because it's cost effective doesn't mean it can't be fancy or at least French. Forty Ounce Wines, which also makes a muscadet, is produced in the Loire Valley by French winemaker Julien Braud.Want to purchase the ros\u00e9 forty? You're going to have to plan a road trip!They're for sale in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, and Colorado.You'll have to move fast. Due to a difficult season in the Loire Valley, the company only produced 1,200 cases from the 2016 vintage so they probably won't last long.", "images": ["https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/5393393_071319-wls-bbq-troops-9a-vid.jpg?w=630&r=16%3A9", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/1864216_40OZ ROSE-VO WIPE_13TV51CJ_1_00-00-37,26.jpg?w=1600", "https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/static/wls/logos/wls_logo_2x.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=120854971962341&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/5393182_071319-wls-ice-raids-930a-vid.jpg?w=630&r=16%3A9", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/5393296_071319-wls-elmhurst-fire-6a-vid.jpg?w=630&r=16%3A9"], "top_img": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/1864216_40OZ ROSE-VO WIPE_13TV51CJ_1_00-00-37,26.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://abc7chicago.com/food/rose-now-comes-in-40-ounce-bottles/1864548/", "title": "Wine lovers, rejoice!
