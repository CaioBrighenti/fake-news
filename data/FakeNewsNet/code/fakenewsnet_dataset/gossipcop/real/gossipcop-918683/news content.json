I felt like filming that would let people know that. That, if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup. \u2026 I hope I gave her a little bit of closure.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Becca Kufrin ABC\n\nKufrin will, in fact, be the next Bachelorette \u2014 a decision that was announced on Tuesday during the live After the Final Rose conclusion to Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2018s season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy for her,\u201d Luyendyk Jr., who is now engaged to Burnham, said of the decision on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m happy that she\u2019s going to be able to find her true love through the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis ending obviously wasn\u2019t perfect. I know it\u2019s difficult for a lot of people to swallow,\u201d he told Strahan. \u201cBecca is going to be the new Bachelorette and I\u2019m very happy for her in that.

Not great.\n\n\u201cIt was embarrassing the way he broke up with me with the full cameras and crew around,\u201d the 27-year-old the Minnesota-based publicist told PEOPLE exclusively for this week\u2019s issue (on newsstands Friday).\n\n\u201cThere was a better and more tactful way to do it,\u201d she added. \u201cA breakup is hard enough, and to have it all filmed and have to re-watch it and know that people all across the country are watching you get your heart broken, it is embarrassing. It\u2019s not fun. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. It was like a slap in the face.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nThat being said, Kufrin just wants to put that chapter of her life behind her.\n\n\u201cI went through all the emotions. I was mad for awhile, I was so sad and down for awhile, I was p\u2014\u2013 for awhile,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this point, I want this chapter of Arie to be done and close it and put it on the shelf and put it away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still going to feel a sense of compassion for him because I did love him,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut at this point, I want him to be happy, I want to be done and not have to worry about them anymore. They\u2019re going to be together and do their thing. I want to move on and have my person that I can focus on and live my life with.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Becca Kufrin ABC/Craig Sjodin\n\nRELATED: Becca Kufrin Breaks Her Silence After Arie Luyendyk Jr. Ends Their Engagement\n\nShe also revealed she\u2019s \u201cready\u201d to be the Bachelorette.\n\n\u201cIt does scare me,\u201d Kufrin admitted. \u201cI\u2019m sure it would [scare] any human, knowing that I was just engaged, I was in love. But I have so much love to give and I want just a partner in life. I\u2019m not afraid to date these guys and find the one who is the best fit for me \u2014 I welcome that with open arms.\u201d\n\nKufrin\u2019s season of The Bachelorette will premiere on May 28 on
