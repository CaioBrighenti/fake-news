Rich's faithfulness to LeeAnne also came into question. Watch the moment, above.\n\nLeeAnne addressed the gossip during a recent interview with Us Weekly. \u201cWhile I am saddened that a cast member has gone below the belt and has falsely accused my fianc\u00e9 of infidelity, the reality is that Rich and I are busy planning a wedding, working on all of the details, and beyond excited about our life-long love affair,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd LeeAnne and Rich aren't taking the rumors too seriously, either. \"After last night\u2019s episode, we laid in bed and laughed until we fell asleep,\u201d LeeAnne told Us Weekly. \u201cAnd by the way \u2014 how could a pirate get away with cheating? Don\u2019t you think he\u2019s the only pirate in Dallas?\u201d\n\nLeeAnne assured The Daily Dish that her relationship with Rich is better than ever when we caught up with her in New York City at the end of September. \"He's my universe. He's everything,\" he gushed. \"He's my security. He's my protector. He's my Prince Charming. He's my provider. And he's my best friend.\"\n\nGet to know more about LeeAnne's future husband, below.", "images":
