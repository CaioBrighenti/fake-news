It's almost too much for \"Felicity\" fans to hope for, but it happened!\n\nOn Tuesday, Scott Speedman (Ben) joined Keri Russell (Felicity) at her Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony and then, just hours later, the former co-stars appeared side-by-side again on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\n\nActors Scott Speedman and Keri Russell attend the star unveiling ceremony for Russell on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, May 30, 2017. Robyn Beck / AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut before fans of the show get excited about the possibility of another reunion \u2014 as in a series revival \u2014 they should be warned: That really is too much to hope for.\n\nWhen Kimmel asked the pair if a \"'Gilmore Girls-y' kind of thing\" might happen, Speedman said, \"I really don't think so.\"\n\nHowever, he added, \"I would do it.\" The problem is simply that \u201csome people are on some high-class shows.\"\n\nNo doubt he means that with Russell busy on \"The Americans\" and Scott Foley (Noel) working on \"Scandal,\" neither would be eager to return to their WB-drama roots 19 years after it all began.\n\nThe cast of Felicity back in the day: Scott Speedman, Keri Russell, and Scott Foley.

I got to work and she turned around the corner and my face sort of froze in a half-panic, half-smile. I just did not pull it off.\"\n\nNot to worry \u2014 even Russell now calls it her \"Chia Pet\" 'do.\n\n\"But it grew into something great, and we all recovered from it,\" he assured.\n\nKeri Russell is honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 30, 2017. Jason LaVeris / FilmMagic\n\nAs for him being a \"disaster of a boyfriend\" back in the day Russell didn't exactly disagree.\n\n\"A young 20s boyfriend is called a disaster of a boyfriend,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Not much has changed,\" the \"Animal Kingdom\" actor added.\n\nRELATED", "images": ["https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_22/1218017/keri-russell-today-tease-1-170531_6a50d8ca789825a81156278331b571e7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_22/1218017/keri-russell-today-tease-1-170531_6a50d8ca789825a81156278331b571e7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/felicity-s-keri-russell-scott-speedman-reunite-talk-romance-reboot-t112148", "title": "'Felicity's' Keri Russell and Scott Speedman reunite to talk romance, reboot, and that haircut", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/felicity-s-keri-russell-scott-speedman-reunite-talk-romance-reboot-t112148", "title": "\u2018Felicity\u2019 reunion!
