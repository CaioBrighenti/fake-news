The clause can be added to contracts for actors and others working on a movie, requiring that the movie\u2019s producers hire a diverse cast and crew. If the movie wasn\u2019t diverse, it would give the actor a legal reason to back out of the contract \u2014 meaning the rider could have a serious effect on all the hiring practices on a film.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-26-at-1.07.52-PM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jimmykimmel2018oscars.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spider-man-far-from-home-DF-06693_r.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fast-and-furious-every-car-ranked-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-927307618-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DogTheBountyHunter-1-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChloeDan-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-5.59.05-PM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/envelope.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-108340929-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Guillermo-del-Toro-Oscars-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CMS_EW_061919_Comedy618x742-1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070919_Whitman_Quibi_1092px.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1153289783-1-e1562700127279.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2F5A0156.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Daniel Kohn", "Brian Welk", "Ashley Boucher", "Steve Pond", "Ross A.
