They don\u2019t make them like this girl. Thank you Kristin,\u201d Gad concluded his caption of a selfie with his parents and Bell.\n\nImage zoom\n\nMillions are evacuating from Florida but not everyone has been able to get out of the state, Bell and Gad\u2019s family are among them. Those unable to get out are now finding it increasingly hard to find somewhere to stay.\n\nThe wife of actor Dax Shepard has been in Florida since Thursday as seen on her Instagram account.\n\nAnd on Friday, Bell did her best to help those displaced by Irma.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have the option to leave so here we are. Just doing our best and trying to stay positive but cautious, and trying to help those who need help prepping,\u201d the mother of two said. \u201cSad that a hurricane has to bring out the best in everyone \u2013 but happy that the community will be holding hands through this.\u201d\n\nIrma, a Category 5 hurricane with 180 mph winds, hit Puerto Rico on Wednesday night after smashing a string of small northern Caribbean islands. The highly destructive Hurricane Irma left at least one million Puerto Rico residents without power as it continues to roar through the Caribbean.\n\nIrma \u2014 one of the strongest storms ever recorded on the Atlantic \u2014 has killed at least 11 people in St. Martin, St. Bart, Barbuda and Anguilla.\n\nMeteorologists expect Irma to make landfall in the Florida Keys between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. ET on Sunday, according to ABC News.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/debbi-ryan.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-09-at-12-47-07-am.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1114px%2C584.85px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/amazon-celeb-deals-tout.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screen-shot-2019-07-12-at-10.35.04-am-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/don-cheadle-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kathryn-hahn.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/social-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/kristen-bell2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/seb-gwyn-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jordyn-woods-jaden-smith.jpg?crop=0px%2C389px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/cameron-boyce-c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1400px%2C735px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_9084343c_huge.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tt-hpy-hugh-jackman-greatest-wingman-proposal-surprise-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C195px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/df-24907_rv3-large_1000x667p_thumbnail.jpg?crop=0px%2C353px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-1146348786.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/veronica-mars-31.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-rock-throwback.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rip-torn.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/shaft-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ken3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/cameron-boyce-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C80px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/china-mcclain-cameron-boyce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2557px%2C1342.425px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-09-at-12-47-07-am.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1114px%2C584.85px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/josh-gad-frozen-kristen-bell-saving-his-family-hurricane-irma/", "title": "Josh Gad Thanks Frozen Costar Kristen Bell for 'Literally Saving' His Family From Hurricane Irma", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kristen bell, josh gad, josh gad parents, frozen, frozen 2, hurricane irma", "news_keywords": "kristen bell, josh gad, josh gad parents, frozen, frozen 2, hurricane irma", "description": "\"You are an angel.
