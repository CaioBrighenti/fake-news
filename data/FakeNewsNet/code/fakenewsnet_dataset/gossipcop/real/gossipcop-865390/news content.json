Kim posted a lengthy Facebook message to fans explaining that he decided to leave the show after contract negotiations with the network failed. Kim and Park reportedly had been seeking equal pay with stars Alex O\u2019Loughlin and Scott Caan. CBS, in turn, responded with a statement saying the network offered the duo \u201clarge and significant salary raises.\u201d\n\nIn response, Lenkov addressed H50 fans directly in his message on Twitter, explaining that both actors were offered \u201cunprecedented raises\u201d by the \u201cextremely generous\u201d network, but \u201cchose to move on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for all your messages and support over 7 seasons,\u201d Lenkov wrote. \u201cWe are all saddened by the Daniel and Grace news and I wanted to reach out to you directly. The truth is this: Both actors chose not to extend their contracts. CBS was extremely generous and proactive in their renegotiation talks. So much so, the actors were getting unprecedented raises, but in the end they chose to move on. No one wanted to see them go \u2014 they are irreplaceable. After being away from her family for seven years, I understood Grace\u2019s decision to leave. There was an opportunity for her to return for a handful of episodes, but for several reasons that didn\u2019t work out. In the end, everyone tried their best to keep the ohana intact. So much so, we were holding off from reporting the news, hoping an agreement could still be reached. Yes, it\u2019s heartbreaking, but this happens on long-running shows. It is a hurdle we all worked hard to overcome.\u201d\n\nLenkov also addressed the criticism from fans, who quickly took to social media to complain that the show was axing two actors of Asian descent. Park and Kim\u2019s exits also came after Masi Oka, who played Dr. Max Bergman since early in season 1, exited Hawaii Five-0 during season 7. Lenkov wrote, \u201cOver our 168 episodes, Hawaii Five-0 has and will continue to showcase one of the most diverse casts on TV: Chi McBride, Jorge Garcia, Mark Dacascos, Ian Anthony Dale, Will Yun Lee, Masi Oka, Dennis Chun, Taylor Wily, Shawn Garnett, Kimee Balmilero, Keko Kekumano, Shawn Anthony Thomsen, as well as Daniel and Grace\u2026 all of these great talents regulars or recurring. I\u2019m proud of that roster and of our show.\u201d\n\nThough the duo won\u2019t continue with the show, viewers will find out what happened to their characters in the season premiere. At the end of last season, Kono (Park) left the team to investigate a child sex trafficking ring, while Chin (Kim) was offered an opportunity to start up a San Francisco task force. As EW previously reported, the show is casting a new female series regular (details here).\n\nHawaii Five-0 will return Friday, Sept. 29 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/109421_017b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/the-good-doctor_-daniel-dae-kim2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/gettyimages-1013442282.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/the-good-doctor-b.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad140d40dd6562601aa876e83bafb3d2?s=300&d=blank&r=g"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/109421_017b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Abrams"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/06/hawaii-five-0-daniel-dae-kim-grace-park-controversy/", "title": "Hawaii Five-0 boss speaks out on Daniel Dae Kim, Grace Park controversy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Hawaii Five-0, CBS, Daniel Dae Kim, Grace Park, Peter Lenkov", "news_keywords": "Hawaii Five-0, CBS, Daniel Dae Kim, Grace Park, Peter Lenkov", "description": "EP Peter Lenkov released a statement addressing their departures", "og": {"title": "'Hawaii Five-0' Boss Speaks Out on Daniel Dae Kim, Grace Park Controversy", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/06/hawaii-five-0-daniel-dae-kim-grace-park-controversy/", "description": "In the wake of what's turned into a somewhat contentious cast departure, Hawaii Five-0 showrunner Peter Lenkov used\u00a0Twitter to reveal\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/109421_017b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/06/hawaii-five-0-daniel-dae-kim-grace-park-controversy/", "description": "EP Peter Lenkov released a statement addressing their departures", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/109421_017b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/06/hawaii-five-0-daniel-dae-kim-grace-park-controversy/", "title": "'Hawaii Five-0' Boss Speaks Out on Daniel Dae Kim, Grace Park Controversy", "description": "EP Peter Lenkov released a statement addressing their departures", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/109421_017b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499313600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
