Let\u2019s discuss it all.\u201d\n\nThese 24 hours have been sobering: I want to share your stories on my podcast: on either side, being accused of something you didn't do or being victimized & left helpless. Let\u2019s discuss it all. Stassi@juststassi.com \u2014 Stassi Schroeder (@stassi) November 26, 2017\n\nAs previously reported, the Vanderpump Rules star, 29, referenced victims of sexual assault on her Straight Up With Stassi podcast in a since-deleted episode called \u201cAre We on a Male Witch Hunt?\u201d Schroeder claimed that many victims were originally \u201cwilling\u201d to go to hotel rooms and were only speaking out against sexual harassment now because of the \u201chashtag me too trend.\u201d She also stated that \u201cno one can make me suck someone\u2019s d\u2013k.\u201d\n\nMany listeners were outraged with what they perceived to be insensitive views and took to Twitter to express their disgust. Advertisers \u2014 including Rent The Runway, Simple Contacts and Framebridge \u2014 also spoke out against Schroeder\u2019s comments and publicly terminated their business relationships with her.\n\nSome fans were not swayed by the reality star\u2019s mea culpa and accused her of apologizing only for the sake of her business.\n\nOne fan wrote, \u201cThanks for the apology but this should have been your FIRST response instead dismissing everyone and retweeting people who were agreeing with your harmful opinions.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote, \u201cyou\u2019re only backpeddling now because you\u2019ve lost advertisers for your podcast. Too late for apologies, we truly know how you feel. #Victimblaming or #victimshaming is something u won\u2019t understand because it hasn\u2019t happened to you #MeToo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say this after tweeting that you only deleted the episode because people \u2018weren\u2019t ready\u2019 to hear what you had to say? Too late for this bullshit PR move to save you. The damage is done,\u201d tweeted another.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
