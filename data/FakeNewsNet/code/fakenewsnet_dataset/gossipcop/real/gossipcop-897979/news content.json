And if in a year or two years they come back into my life and I feel okay\u2026 okay. But I can\u2019t be like homies with my ex,\u201d Scheana explained to E! News.\n\nThen, when asked if fans should anticipate a future reunion with Rob, Scheana exclaimed, \u201cHell no!\u201d\n\nAlso during her interview with E! News, Scheana said fans of Vanderpump Rules should expect to see her undergo a number of changes with her friendships with her co-stars. That said, rumors of a feud with her best friend Ariana Madix are false.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see some friendship changes, like positive. Positive! I said that the other day and then it was like, \u2018Scheana and Ariana, not friends anymore,\u2019 That\u2019s not what I said. No, I just said there\u2019s changes drastically in the friendships,\u201d she explained.\n\nIn Scheana Marie\u2019s latest two Instagram photos, she was seen with Ariana Madix and a number of other cast members of Vanderpump Rules.\n\nScheana Marie and Robert Parks-Valletta began dating ahead of Vanderpump Rules Season 6 and chronicled their relationship throughout the sixth season. Then, just weeks after the show wrapped production, Rob broke things off with the reality star.\n\nAt the reunion special for Season 6, Scheana broke down about their breakup but told press she was sure that they would ultimately get back together, get married, and start a family.\n\n\u201cWe have every intention of getting married one day and having a family, but we just don\u2019t know when that day will be,\u201d she said during an interview with Page Six last December, four months after her and Rob\u2019s breakup. \u201cI\u2019m like, that\u2019s going to be one hell of a story to tell the grandkids, grandma and grandpa couldn\u2019t get it together for 13 years, but now they\u2019ve been married for 50.\u201d\n\nIn the year since her split from Rob, Scheana has been linked to the Bachelorette\u2019s Robby Hayes and her Vanderpump Rules co-star Adam Spott.\n\nTo see more of Scheana Marie and her co-stars, tune into the seventh season of Vanderpump Rules on Monday nights at 9 p.m. on Bravo TV.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/34feb98eadd86f8672383a21efe174f9?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Scheana-Marie-Talks-Rob-Valletta-Split.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1472001486461948&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=478801082325642&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Melissa-Riso-300x170.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Cronin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5195383/scheana-marie-dishes-on-potential-reunion-with-rob-valletta-plus-did-she-and-ariana-madix-have-a-falling-out/", "title": "Scheana Marie Dishes On Potential Reunion With Rob Valletta, Plus Did She And Ariana Madix Have A Falling Out?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
