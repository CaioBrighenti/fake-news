But the beginning of the episode Scully is dressing again with the same clothes she fell asleep in and her jacket was on Mulder\u2019s bed and he is sleeping on his bed naked. For a show that always tries to be \u2018tasteful\u2019 about sex scenes this is almost the \u2018money shot\u2019\n\nNow most fans, including myself, think they started to have sex after the kiss in Millennium and \u2018all things\u2019 is merely the episode where \u2018William\u2019 might had been conceived or/and the episode where Scully accepts that she was meant to be with Mulder but that is more up for debate. Hope that helps!", "images": ["https://qsf.fs.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favicon.ico-26-ae77b637b1e7ed2c.ico", "https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-28536761-100-PoupuiqH7jae02a7YgHVpr7gDP8YprEv.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://qsf.fs.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favicon.ico-26-ae77b637b1e7ed2c.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.quora.com/The-X-Files-TV-series-Did-Mulder-and-Scully-ever-have-sex", "title": "The X-Files (TV series): Did Mulder and Scully ever have sex?", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.quora.com", "summary": ""}
