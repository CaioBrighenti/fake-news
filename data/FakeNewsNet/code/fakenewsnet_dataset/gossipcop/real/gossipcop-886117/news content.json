{"url": "http://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/vicki-gunvalson-kelly-dodd-real-housewives-orange-county-season-13-reunion-video", "text": "With the exception of that debate over Girl Code and a confrontation with Steve Lodge at Eddie Judge's birthday party, Vicki Gunvalson and Kelly Dodd's relationship has seemed to be in good shape this season of The Real Housewives of Orange County. However, their subsequent comments about each other in their Bravotv.com blogs, in interviews, and on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen have left us wondering if there's trouble in paradise for this pair.\n\nSo when Kelly revealed during an interview with ET in October right before the filming of the RHOC Season 13 reunion that she and Vicki \"don't talk at all\" these days, we knew that they would have A LOT to say to each other at the sit-down with Andy Cohen. And who knows? Perhaps this friendship could actually get back on track after a heart-to-heart at the reunion. Stranger things have happened in the OC, like that hug between Vicki, Tamra Judge, and Shannon Beador at last season's reunion, after all.\n\nLuckily for us, Vicki put us out of our misery and gave us a taste of the outcome of this season's reunion, revealing how things are between her and Kelly now when she appeared on WWHL on Monday night. Get an update on these two, as well as what recent comments of Kelly's Vicki called \"rude,\" in the above clip.\n\nIf that doesn't make you excited for the RHOC Season 13 reunion, you might want to check your pulse.\n\nThere's still more RHOC on the way this season. Find out which relationships are going strong and which could use some TLC in Monday night's episode at 9/8c.
