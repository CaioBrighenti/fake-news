I don't know what this is all about,\" Henry says in the clip, kicking his legs into the air.\n\n\"I do,\" Hale replies, with a shocked look on her face. \"Wow. I have a photograph framed with my grandmother, friends, and they're all doing that.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's my favorite photo! I want to say she's in her cheerleading uniform with her cheerleading friends,\" she continues. \"But it's the greatest photo of all time.\"\n\n\"This person's also having me bring forward your success. This is sweet,\" Henry says. \"She's bringing me to that time in your life, and she already felt like you were going to be something special, even back then. There's something even about you at that younger age that she was able to identify... she believed in you even before you believed in yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\"She definitely did,\" Hale confirms. \"I don't think many people thought in my family, that it would be what it is. But I always think that she did.\"\n\nHollywood Medium With Tyler Henry airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on E!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMegan Fox Tries to Tap Into Her Own 'Intuition' on 'Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry' (Exclusive)\n\n'Hollywood Medium' Tyler Henry Helps David and Rosanna Arquette Connect With Late Sister Alexis (Exclusive)\n\n'Hollywood Medium' Tyler Henry Reveals 3 Biggest Regrets the Deceased Have After They \u2018Transition\u2019 (Exclusive)", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-670899220.jpg?itok=RZJcnX0U&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-670899220.jpg?itok=njHk3Esk", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1154906971.jpg?itok=sZoGPV7c&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x169/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1242911076001_5742617189001_5742606256001-vs.jpg?itok=GK5Ok8c2", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-06/gettyimages-958745538.jpg?itok=wlJ28kMj&h=87c7c3fc"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-670899220.jpg?itok=njHk3Esk", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/lucy-hale-shares-sweet-memories-of-her-grandmother-on-hollywood-medium-with-tyler-henry-exclusive", "title": "Lucy Hale Shares Sweet Memories of Her Grandmother on 'Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry' (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"title": "Lucy Hale Shares Sweet Memories of Her Grandmother on 'Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry' (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lucy-hale-shares-sweet-memories-of-her-grandmother-on-hollywood-medium-with-tyler-henry-exclusive", "title": "Lucy Hale Shares Sweet Memories of Her Grandmother on 'Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry' (Exclusive)", "description": "The 'Pretty Little Liars' star says her grandmother always believed in her talent.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-670899220.jpg?itok=njHk3Esk", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 'Pretty Little Liars' star says her grandmother always believed in her talent.", "title": "Lucy Hale Shares Sweet Memories of Her Grandmother on 'Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry' (Exclusive)", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lucy-hale-shares-sweet-memories-of-her-grandmother-on-hollywood-medium-with-tyler-henry-exclusive", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-670899220.jpg?itok=njHk3Esk"}, "description": "The 'Pretty Little Liars' star says her grandmother always believed in her talent.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Lucy Hale, Tyler Henry", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Lucy Hale, Tyler Henry"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
