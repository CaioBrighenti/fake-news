However I\u2019m not going to show it to you so you\u2019ll see it tomorrow. I will send you this though,\u201d wrote Shawn, who included a picture of a green background with what appears to be an American flag sticker, \u201cproudly made in the USA\u201d and \u201c1/1\u2033 uncle bubby\u201d written in black ink.\n\n\u201cThis is the back part that will be up against the wall,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn reply to the photo, Amber, 27, said, \u201cAwe Bubby I can\u2019t wait!!\u201d and added, \u201cI\u2019m sure little James will love it!\u201d\n\nAwe Bubby I can't wait!! I'm sure little James will love it!\ud83e\udd17 \u2014 Amber Portwood (@AmberLPortwood) January 3, 2018\n\nMore than a month after PEOPLE confirmed that Portwood was pregnant with her second child \u2014 she is also mom to 8-year-old daughter Leah with ex Gary Shirley \u2014 the reality star revealed that she and her cinematographer boyfriend Glennon, whom she met while filming Marriage Boot Camp with ex Matt Baier, were expecting a boy.\n\n\u201cLittle baby Glennon is on his way,\u201d she wrote, captioning an Instagram image of a Christmas ornament with the inscription \u201cIt\u2019s A Boy!\u201d written on it.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s Teen Mom OG episode, Glennon made his debut on the reality series.\n\n\u201cWhen I did Boot Camp with Matt, he ran the lights or whatever \u2026 he was pretty much saying he related to my story. He wasn\u2019t trying to f\u2014 with me,\u201d Portwood told an MTV producer about Glennon, who at the time was coming out to visit for a few days so that the pair could get to know one another more. \u201cHe sounded very sweet. I want to meet him first off-camera, away from everybody so I can get a feel for him, and kind of see if it\u2019s anything I want to pursue. You never know, we might not ever have anything in common and just be like, \u2018Okay, it was a good ride for a couple of days.\u2019 \u201d\n\nImage zoom MTV\n\nWhen MTV producers finally met Glennon, they asked how he had gotten to know her.\n\n\u201cI got to learn a lot about her on the [Marriage Boot Camp],\u201d said Glennon. \u201cThe first day, I was in the interview room with her and that\u2019s when I think I learned the most. From that point on I tried to place myself in the house where you were to learn more.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom OG airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images":
