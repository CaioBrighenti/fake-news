Police audio shows that Soules called 911 to report that he had \u201crear-ended a guy on a tractor\u201d and sought medical help for Mosher before he left the scene in another vehicle.\n\nAuthorities say that Soules was located at his home about 10 miles away but that he initially refused to answer his door for officers. He was arrested five hours after the crash after they obtained a warrant to enter the home. Soules was released on bond Tuesday after 10 hours in jail.\n\nInvestigators are looking into who drove Soules away and whether alcohol, speed or texting played a role in the crash. The sheriff says alcoholic beverages were found at the scene and police are trying to determine who had possessed them.\n\nSoules had been represented by attorney Molly Spellman at his initial court appearance Tuesday. But on Thursday, high-profile Iowa defense lawyer Alfredo Parrish and two colleagues from his Des Moines law firm informed the court that they are now representing Soules in the case.\n\nA statement issued Thursday from the firm and Soules\u2019 publicist argued audio of the 911 call showed that initial portrayals of Soules having fled the scene were misleading.\n\nThe statement noted that Soules identified himself on the call and \u201cexplained his role in the terrible accident.\u201d It added that he tried to perform CPR on the victim and stayed until emergency medical personnel arrived \u2014 two facts that aren\u2019t clear on the call.\n\nThe call featured someone performing CPR but it wasn\u2019t clear that it was Soules, who told the dispatcher that he didn\u2019t know the technique. The call was abruptly ended by Soules, who police say then \u201ctook off\u201d in a truck.\n\n\u201cHis attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to provide aid to Mr. Mosher,\u201d the statement said, adding that everyone \u201cin this close-knit farming community is mourning Mr. Mosher\u2019s passing.\u201d\n\nSoules, who is required to wear an ankle bracelet for monitoring, is due in court next week for a preliminary hearing.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/chris-soules1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/chris-soules1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/d29ea10c24a74df597d0ccaa32076ecd/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/chris-soules1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Associated Press", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/04/27/chris-soules-did-everything-in-his-power-to-help-crash-victim-lawyers-say/", "title": "Chris Soules \u2018acted reasonably\u2019 after deadly crash, lawyers say", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2019 NYP Holdings.
