(Intentional distraction? Perhaps.)\n\nThe singer was spotted for the first time since giving birth to her twins exactly one month ago. On the same evening, she revealed the first-ever photo of her new babies to Instagram (she was wearing a cape by Palomo Spain for the photo shoot).\n\nShe chose a light-toned ensemble, consisting of a high-waisted light pink miniskirt and white bell-sleeve blouse, paired with matching light pink heeled sandals from Giuseppe Zanotti and a similarly toned fur handbag. The 35-year-old mother of three and her husband Jay Z were reportedly headed to an event for Roc Nation artist Vic Mensa in Los Angeles, according to People . Though images of her exit show her in the killer platform heels, she was also spotted entering the venue wearing a pair of black strappy sandals.\n\nPinterest BACKGRID\n\nUpdate: Bey posted the pics herself on Instagram, and they give us a much better view.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nPeople also reported that the duo stuck around for less than an hour, sneaking out 20 minutes after the now-famed photograph was posted on Beyonc\u00e9's social media account\u2014that has since amassed almost 8 million \"likes.\" Welcome back to the spotlight, Queen B.\n\nRelated: (Beyonc\u00e9's Post-Pregnancy Dress Is By the Men's Wear Designer Palomo Spain)[https://www.wmagazine.com/story/beyonce-twins-photo-dress-palomo-spain]\n\nSee What's Trending in W Video:", "images": ["https://www.wmagazine.com/images/w_logo.svg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5968fc24453684204b42fa37/2:1/w_790,c_limit/bey-and-jay.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5968fc0b48a7bb6995252c68/master/w_320,c_limit/Unknown.jpeg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5968fc80453684204b42fa3b/3:2/w_640/GettyImages-493728062.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/591a0f0b2006e2187de4708d/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Kate%20Moss.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f1897cc1eac746f6e754f/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Brad%20Pitt.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/591a0f0ebf330e0e94ab3980/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Selena%20Gomez.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5968fc24453684204b42fa37/2:1/w_790,c_limit/bey-and-jay.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Avery Matera"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/beyonce-date-night-jay-z-first-sighting-post-twins", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Steps Out for the First Time Since Giving Birth to Twins", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "author": "Avery Matera", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 was spotted at an event for Roc Nation artist Vic Mensa Thursday night; it was her first public sighting since giving birth to twins, Rumi and Sir Carter.", "publishDate": "2017-07-14T18:23:58Z", "keywords": "beyonc\u00e9,celebrity fashion,snd", "fb": {"app_id": 230068530489385, "admins": 108943, "pages": 40621875003}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Steps Out for the First Time Since Giving Birth to Twins", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/beyonce-date-night-jay-z-first-sighting-post-twins", "description": "On the same evening, she shares the first image Rumi and Sir.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5968fc24453684204b42fa37/2:1/w_790,c_limit/bey-and-jay.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "wmag", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Steps Out for the First Time Since Giving Birth to Twins", "description": "On the same evening, she shares the first image Rumi and Sir.", "image": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5968fc24453684204b42fa37/2:1/w_790,c_limit/bey-and-jay.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "domain": "wmagazine.com"}, "version": "2.0.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500056638.0, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
