She\u2019s charged with possession of a controlled substance.\n\n\u201cMs. McGowan appeared in Loudoun County, Virginia, on Nov.14, 2017, to accept service of the Airports Authority Police arrest warrant, and she was released on a $5,000 unsecured bond,\u201d a spokesperson for the police department said.\n\nREAD MORE: Rose McGowan alleges Harvey Weinstein offered $1M in hush money\n\nThe felony charge stems from what prosecutors say was cocaine found among McGowan\u2019s personal belongings left behind on a Jan. 20 flight to Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.\n\nAn airport employee allegedly found McGowan\u2019s wallet with two bags of white powder inside.\n\nFollowing her release, the actress spoke to the New Yorker\u2019s Ronan Farrow.\n\nMcGowan explained to Farrow that she carried a slim card wallet with her on the trip to Washington and had not taken the wallet out of her bag, which was allegedly left unattended when she went to the washroom mid-flight.\n\nREAD MORE: Rose McGowan delivers powerful speech in 1st public appearance since Weinstein allegations\n\n\u201cI had it in the side pocket of my backpack, and I left it on my seat as I went to the bathroom,\u201d the 44-year-old actress told Farrow.\n\nMcGowan then realized her wallet was missing when she arrived at baggage claim. She said she tweeted United Airlines to help her find the wallet.\n\nShe said that a detective later contacted her and told her to come get her wallet. McGowan said she feared it was a fake officer as she believed she was being followed, following a tweet several months earlier about being raped by a \u201cstudio head.\u201d\n\nMcGowan has since named Harvey Weinstein as her alleged sexual abuser. Weinstein, through his spokesperson, has denied \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex.\u201d\n\nWATCH BELOW: Rose McGowan delivers powerful speech in first public remarks since Weinstein scandal\n\n\u201cI was going to ASAP but then things started to get really weird. I knew I was being followed and that I wasn\u2019t safe,\u201d McGowan said.\n\nJim Hundley, McGowan\u2019s lawyer, argues that the drugs could have been planted while the wallet was missing and the actress denies she uses cocaine.\n\nREAD MORE: Harvey Weinstein reportedly hired former spies to help silence accusers\n\nShe says that cocaine was the last thing on her mind at the time as she was on her way to attend the Women\u2019s March. \u201cImagining I\u2019m going into sisterly solidarity, I can think of nothing more opposed to that, energetically, that I would want in my body at that moment,\u201d McGowan told Farrow.\n\n\u201cI will clearly plead not guilty,\u201d McGowan said.\n\nMcGowan claimed that the warrant for her arrest was part of a conspiracy to silence her, in a tweet from Oct. 30.\n\n\u201cAre they trying to silence me? There is a warrant out for my arrest in Virginia. What a load of HORSESH**,\u201d she tweeted.\n\n\u2014With files from the Associated Press", "images": ["https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/chy102175254_high.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_8137-1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=55&h=55&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/social-impulse/large/facebook/national.gif", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/image-2.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=620&h=349&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/398/23/ETC061919GlassTigerThirtyThreeInStudioUpdatedONLINES.png?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rcmp-pelican-narrows-youth-arrest.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=150", "https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/510/743/NA37F%20ROSE%20MCGOWAN%20WOMENS%20CONFERENCE.00_00_53_10.Still001.jpg?w=670&quality=70&strip=all", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/images/gnlive-ads/default.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005670&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/104/787/SUN_GMTL_DAN_SPECTOR_200817_848x480_1028751427855.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/9572838.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_5882-e1562605151708.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/ad-choices.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/kroeker.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/19617757-e1535073439213.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/489/3/DOG_BETH_CHAPMAN_848x480_1559588931739.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stock-floor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/image-2.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=282", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/732/867/Pence_Iran_848x480_1564135491702.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/raw_3gr0_botanical_sexism_1.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/logos/news_2x.png", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/36/615/2019-07-12T05-05-04.1Z--1280x720.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/image-2.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=620&h=349&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Scott", "National Online Journalist"], "canonical_link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3862301/rose-mcgowan-will-plead-not-guilty-to-drug-possession/", "title": "Rose McGowan says she will plead not guilty to drug possession", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#133F6F", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Rose McGowan says she will plead not guilty to drug possession -
