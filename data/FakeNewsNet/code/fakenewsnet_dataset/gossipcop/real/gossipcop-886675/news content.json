{"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/georgina-chapman-life-after-harvey-weinstein", "text": "On the day in late February when I arrive at Georgina Chapman\u2019s town house in the West Village to interview her, it\u2019s unseasonably hot, nearly 80 degrees. I am ushered to the parlor floor, where, even though it feels like August outside, a fire is roaring away. As I wait, it suddenly dawns on me that I am sitting in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s living room. He purchased the six-story house in 2006, the year before he married Chapman, and she has since put her stamp all over it: black floors and white rugs, chinoiserie, lots of gilt and glass, hydrangeas in a vase, a Jo Malone candle burning. On a console table are silver-framed photographs from happier times, mostly of the couple\u2019s children: India and Dashiell, seven and five. All evidence of the original occupant would appear to have been scrubbed away\u2014except for a large piece of art hanging in the hallway. At the bottom, it is signed, \u201cFor Harvey Weinstein.\u201d The drawing is dominated by a large empty circle, next to which it reads, \u201cThe moon was here.\u201d\n\nI had been introduced to Chapman, dressed in a floor-length dark print dress, a couple of weeks earlier at the West Twenty-sixth Street atelier of the fashion company, Marchesa, that she co-owns with Keren Craig. That day, she struck me as hyperalert: flitting around, wide-eyed and nervous, uncomfortable in her skin\u2014or lack thereof, as it were. She mentioned, almost in passing, that she hadn\u2019t been out in public in five months\u2014not since the news broke in October of so many unbearably similar accusations by so many women of harassment, abuse, and rape perpetrated by her husband. When she appears today, dressed in jeans, a white T-shirt, ballerina flats, and an armful of gold bracelets, she is more relaxed, though there\u2019s a gallows humor\u2014a morbidity\u2014firmly in place. When I mention the disturbingly warm weather, she laughs and says, \u201cThink of all the poor plants that are going to spring out and then die.\u201d\n\nWe head downstairs to the ground floor, where most of the living takes place: a big, casual, open space with lots of color, modern furniture, and surprising art. There\u2019s a huge, elegant kitchen that looks out onto a backyard, and a TV room where Dash, on spring break, is sitting on a sectional, ensorcelled by some kind of electronic device. At 42, Chapman looks younger. Or is it that she seems younger? In photographs, she has often reminded me of Victoria Beckham\u2014chiseled and somewhat brittle-looking. But, today, dressed so California-casual, her hair now long and blonde, with wide-set blue eyes and fine features, she looks more like a younger Michelle Pfeiffer. Though she is English to her core, using whilst and learnt in a thick, posh accent, she is more goofy than I had imagined. As we sit down to lunch\u2014a simple spread of veal Milanese and eggplant parmigiana\u2014she seems a bit flustered, unable to maintain a hostess facade for too long, or even to decide where I should sit.\n\nOur meeting, in her soon-to-be ex\u2013town house that her soon-to-be ex-husband recently sold, was meant to be the moment when Chapman would finally, publicly address for the first time what happened. The night before, she had called me fairly late, and I thought she was going to back out. She sounded worried, apologizing profusely, talking fast. She was not ready to address anything too difficult, did not feel prepared. I reassured her that we could talk about her life before Harvey or about Marchesa\u2014which is exactly what we did at first.\n\nNot long after the news broke, common wisdom had it that no actress would ever wear a Marchesa dress again, and no bride would ever walk down the aisle in a gown designed by Chapman. In January, she canceled the runway show for Marchesa\u2019s fall 2018 collection, which fueled rumors that the brand was in trouble. But Chapman says she herself made the decision not to offer any clothes for awards season. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate given the situation,\u201d she says. \u201cAll the women who have been hurt deserve dignity and respect, so I want to give it the time it deserves. It\u2019s a time for mourning, really.\u201d But she also has loyal supporters. \u201cA lot of people reached out and said, \u2018Let me wear something,\u2019 \u201d and Scarlett Johansson picked a Marchesa gown to wear to May\u2019s Met ball.\n\nFashion now is such a social business\u2014so many parties, so much self-presentation. Turns out, Chapman has felt insecure and awkward at social functions for much of her life. She does not enjoy being the focus of attention, which is one of the reasons she has a tendency to redirect focus onto others. As the actor David Oyelowo, her friend of 25 years, tells me, \u201cIt\u2019s something she\u2019s had to cultivate: the ability to try to fade into the background. That\u2019s why, when she\u2019s at a party, she spends a lot of time and energy making other people feel comfortable, listened to, important.\u201d\n\nAs our lunch is winding down, I ask, almost in passing, if Chapman really hadn\u2019t been out in five months; she seems to shrink before my eyes as her mouth goes dry. \u201cI was so humiliated and so broken . . . that . . . I, I, I . . . didn\u2019t think it was respectful to go out,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought, Who am I to be parading around with all of this going on? It\u2019s still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped; it was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs.\u201d\n\nI ask if she\u2019s been seeing a therapist. \u201cI have,\u201d she says. \u201cAt first I couldn\u2019t, because I was too shocked. And I somehow felt that I didn\u2019t deserve it. And then I realized: This has happened. I have to own it. I have to move forward.\u201d She takes a long, deep breath. \u201cThere was a part of me that was terribly naive\u2014clearly, so naive. I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief! And I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be?\u201d She has been crying through most of this, and now she breaks down into sobs loud enough that her assistant appears with a box of tissues. \u201cWhat are people going to say to them?\u201d She is crying so hard she has to take a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s like, they love their dad. They love him.\u201d It is almost unbearable to witness, this broken person in front of me. \u201cI just can\u2019t bear it for them!\u201d\n\nChapman grabs a tissue and wipes her tears away\u2014\u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared to say any of that!\u201d\u2014and lets out a deep, guttural laugh.\n\nThings are less fraught when, two weeks later, I meet her at her office at Marchesa and she is surrounded by her team, easily smiling and engaging the world\u2014or at least her world. One of the few working ateliers left in Manhattan, Marchesa is a surprisingly big operation, with about 80 employees, and sewing machines whirring away. Chapman is wearing black leather pants\u2014leggings, really\u2014with zippers at the backs of the ankles, an untucked white tuxedo shirt, and a pair of bedroom slippers studded with fake pearls. Her hair is pulled off her face with a band, and she\u2019s absentmindedly eating from the bag of popcorn that\u2019s sitting on her desk next to an achingly beautiful arrangement of pale-pink and white roses.\n\nKeren Craig is in her office, along with a couple of other women on the design team, as they look at fabrics and swatches and mood boards in search of inspiration for the resort collection they are just beginning to work on. Craig is dressed much like Chapman was the day I first met her: long black floral-print dress to the floor, but with creeper boots, also studded with fake pearls. When I ask if they bedazzled their footwear together, they shout \u201cNo!\u201d in unison and crack up laughing. \u201cThey came bedazzled,\u201d says Craig. Chapman rolls her eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to bedazzle our shoes, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nThe two women met when they were seventeen, during what the British call a foundation course at the Chelsea College of Art and Design. After stints at different art colleges, in the early 2000s they were both living in London. Chapman was getting work doing music videos and, in one particularly odd job, making costumes for a female wrestler. \u201cCrazy getups!\u201d she says.\n\nIn 2004 Chapman and Craig rented a studio together and came up with the name Marchesa because Craig was enthralled with the book Infinite Variety, about the eccentric fin de si\u00e8cle glamour-puss Marchesa Luisa Casati. Their initial idea was to create a loungewear company. Just weeks into this new venture, the two women were invited to a Louis Vuitton party in the English countryside, and, as Craig puts it, \u201cWe were like, Now that we\u2019ve got this fashion label, we really ought to make ourselves something to wear.\u201d They wound up seated at a table with Isabella Blow, who was so taken with Chapman\u2019s dress that she borrowed it to wear to the Paris couture. Once Blow took them under her wing, they started to make real connections and then caught a series of lucky breaks: a sponsorship from Swarov-ski; advice from Jimmy Choo cofounder Tamara Mellon to focus on red-carpet dressing; meetings with powerful publicists and stylists like Nanci Ryder and Rachel Zoe.\n\nBy now, Chapman was dating Weinstein as she went back and forth between London, Los Angeles, and New York, and it did not hurt that he came to every Marchesa show, usually with a celebrity in tow. Marchesa managed to get a dress on Ren\u00e9e Zellweger for the premiere of Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason in London. \u201cThe next morning,\u201d says Craig, \u201cshe was on the cover of every single British newspaper with a picture of our dress.\u201d One day they got a call from Neiman Marcus with an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse: to put Marchesa in multiple stores and help with production to create a diffusion line, which became Marchesa Notte. \u201cIn order to make that happen, I had to move to New York,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cI only meant to come for a few weeks, and then never left.\u201d\n\nWhen you ask about her fashion inspirations, Chapman cites John Galliano and Alexander McQueen\u2014two of the most theatrical, outr\u00e9 designers imaginable\u2014but there is nothing even remotely edgy about what she does. She is unapologetically romantic, clinging to a decidedly unfeminist ideal that there is no happier moment in a woman\u2019s life than when she finally finds that perfect dress. As one fashion insider puts it, \u201cGeorgina puts pretty girls in pretty dresses\u2014and there\u2019s value in that.\u201d And Chapman has no illusions of being avant-garde. She describes Marchesa dresses as \u201ckeepsakes,\u201d to be worn \u201clots of times\u201d and then hopefully handed down to a daughter. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing disposable fashion,\u201d she says. \u201cWe treat each dress like a piece of jewelry, an entity unto itself, with its own journey. It\u2019s not just one in a queue.\u201d\n\nThat being said, they do have bestsellers and perennial favorites. I ask Chapman about price-point sweet spots. \u201cIt really depends,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of the gowns we did last season was nearly $13,000, and we couldn\u2019t stop selling it. And then there\u2019s an evening gown we make a version of every year that sells for around $4,995.\u201d Chapman runs down the hall, grabs one, and dangles it in front of me. \u201cIt\u2019s quite sexy. You\u2019ve got a corset, it\u2019s off the shoulder, you get some drama around the neck with these feathers, it nips you at the waist, gives you a bosom, and you get a bit of leg! When you get it out, you know you\u2019re going to feel good in that dress.\u201d\n\nThe formula has worked for them. As recently as 2016, actresses wore Marchesa more often than any other designer on the red carpet. As Christy Rilling, who fitted Michelle Obama into nearly every dress she wore as First Lady, says, \u201cTheir atelier is really special. And they\u2019ve gotten better over the years. I\u2019ve seen what they do for the Oscars\u2014they really make magic happen.\u201d\n\nOne of the criticisms that has been leveled at Marchesa is that they\u2019d have been nothing without Harvey Weinstein, who, people have claimed, bullied stars into wearing his wife\u2019s dresses. \u201cThey absolutely had a push from Harvey,\u201d says Chapman\u2019s friend the writer Neil Gaiman. \u201cBut you cannot hype something from nothing and make it last. And Harvey\u2019s hyping worked because George is actually an artist. I\u2019ve watched her at work and been impressed and fascinated. She has a vision, and she\u2019s really good at it.\u201d\n\nOne morning in early April, Chapman texts me a photograph of a young girl in a very grown-up dress: It\u2019s gray, with a wide skirt made of tulle and a silk corset, all of it covered with pink flowers. \u201cJust found this picture of a dress I made when I was eleven! Things haven\u2019t changed that much!!!\u201d\n\nChapman was born and raised in Richmond, an affluent suburb on the Thames about eight miles from central London. Her father, Brian Chapman, was the founder of Percol, the first ground-coffee company on the shelves to bear the Fairtrade mark. Her mother, Caroline Wonfor, was a journalist who worked for Reader\u2019s Digest for many years. She has a younger brother, Edward, who is the CEO of Marchesa, and even though their parents divorced when she was in her 20s, they are a very close-knit group. \u201cMy father is self-made,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cHe came from a council estate, left school at sixteen, and he built his own company with an incredible work ethic. He\u2019s a true entrepreneur, and he\u2019s always been deeply involved with philanthropy, a forward-thinker that way.\u201d\n\nShe admits she had a very awkward childhood. She was born with a hip defect, \u201cwhich meant that I had terrible pigeon toes, so I couldn\u2019t walk to the top of the street without falling over. I was incredibly clumsy, and it set me back at school socially. I was always that kid who was the last to be picked for any sport because I literally couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d She was also severely dyslexic, which went undiagnosed until she was eight. \u201cI remember going to the library and everyone else could read and I couldn\u2019t. I had terrible anxiety. In class when they would go around and everyone had to read . . . it was just torture.\u201d\n\nSome unholy combination of going to the Victoria and Albert Museum costume department at seven, seeing Princess Diana\u2019s wedding on TV that same year, and being deeply envious of her Catholic cousins \u201cgoing through all of their ceremonies in these beautiful white dresses\u201d planted the seeds for her future. When Chapman was at boarding school\u2014Saint David\u2019s in Ashford, Surrey\u2014she took up drawing and painting. Her roommate there was Andrea Remanda, now a songwriter living in Los Angeles. \u201cHer side of the room looked like a bomb exploded,\u201d Remanda says. \u201cShe had a Guns N\u2019 Roses poster, and I was into Prince. When we were in prep\u2014forced homework time after school\u2014she would draw sketches of what we did during the day, and they were amazing. I still have them.\u201d\n\nRemanda spent a lot of time at Chapman\u2019s parents\u2019 house on weekends. \u201cWhen we were sixteen we went clubbing one night, and she had bought a secondhand man\u2019s blazer from Oxfam for 25 pence. She got out her sewing machine\u2014I don\u2019t even know how she found it in her crazy messy bedroom\u2014and she did a few stitches and put it on, and I just couldn\u2019t believe it! It\u2019s my favorite outfit she\u2019s ever worn. Everyone was like, Where did you get your dress? It looked like a Vivienne Westwood.\u201d\n\nChapman was scouted by an agent when she was seventeen and modeled for a few years, but as she puts it, \u201cIt was very much to make ends meet. I had three jobs: I worked in a bar, I was working in a ski shop on Saturdays\u2014a job I took because I could drink coffee and smoke cigarettes\u2014and I was also waitressing. And I was a terrible waitress. I was so forgetful, I was clumsy, just the worst waitress ever.\u201d Remanda tells me that Chapman did not love modeling. \u201cBeing scrutinized as you are in that industry\u2014\u2018Too short for the catwalk!\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve got to lose weight!\u2019\u2014I don\u2019t think she really wanted to be a part of all that.\u201d\n\nShe was interested in acting, though, and when Chapman was eighteen, she took a train to Hull in northern England to check out the drama-studies department at a college there. The train broke down for three hours, and while she waited she got talking to another young, aspiring actor who was heading the same way for the same reason. It turned out to be Oyelowo, who would go on to play Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma. \u201cWell, anyone who has seen Georgina, the first thing that hits you like a ton of bricks is how beautiful she is, and I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t notice that,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut as we talked, I found her to be an interesting and deeply friendly person. She had none of that frostiness that could be associated with a model.\u201d\n\nNeither one of them wound up going to the drama school in Hull, but they\u2019ve stayed friends. \u201cI was part of a youth theater group at the National Theatre in London,\u201d Oyelowo recalls, \u201cand I invited George along to be part of it. She\u2019s a wonderful actress. I remember clearly thinking that she had a very real career ahead of her had she wanted it.\u201d A couple of years later, Chapman invited Oyelowo to an art exhibition at her college. \u201cA lot of the drawings were of fashion, and her work really stood out,\u201d he says. \u201cI was blown away.\u201d So much so that Oyelowo asked Chapman to make the costumes for The Love of the Nightingale, a play he was performing at the Edinburgh Festival. \u201cAnd these costumes arrived, made from transparent material into which she\u2019d sewn pieces of mirror to reflect the light. They were extraordinary. They upstaged everything else.\u201d\n\nOne Friday afternoon in late March, I head back to Chapman\u2019s town house for another interview over lunch, this one served by her daughter, India, playing waitress. Chapman\u2019s mother, an elegant woman with silver hair in a shag cut, is visiting from London: She comes often these days and spends long stretches, helping out with India and Dash. \u201cShe\u2019s such a happy-go-lucky person,\u201d says Chapman, \u201cso she always lifts the mood and the spirits.\u201d\n\nWhen the one-two punch of all of the allegations against Weinstein landed in early October\u2014first the New York Times investigation, followed by the much more damning piece in The New Yorker a few days later\u2014Chapman was in a kind of stupor. \u201cI lost ten pounds in five days. I couldn\u2019t keep food down.\u201d I ask her how long it took for her to absorb the information. \u201cAbout two days,\u201d she says. \u201cMy head was spinning. And it was difficult because the first article was about a time long before I\u2019d ever met him, so there was a minute where I couldn\u2019t make an informed decision. And then the stories expanded and I realized that this wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. And I knew that I needed to step away and take the kids out of here.\u201d\n\nShe fled to Los Angeles with the children, while her partner, Craig, did her best to steady the ship. \u201cOur friendship always comes first, so foremost, I was worried for Georgina,\u201d Craig says. \u201cSecondly, we have so many talented, loyal people who work for us, some who\u2019ve been here for twelve, thirteen years, so my concern was to get to the office and get the collections out, so that people could be paid and pay their rents.\u201d\n\nChapman eventually went to London to be with her parents, but first she took refuge with an old friend. \u201cI kind of found myself in a first-responder capacity,\u201d says Oyelowo. \u201cMy wife and I were right there with her two kids, and this catastrophe was unfolding in real time across the globe, literally your worst nightmare in terms of a marriage, in terms of the future of your kids and your business. And none of this was your own doing and yet you are entirely lumped into it. The thing that was the most difficult to witness was that she quite rightly took the stance of not going out there and defending herself, because there was just too much white noise and too much bile headed in her general direction. She felt, How dare I raise my head and say, \u2018Oh, by the way, I\u2019m suffering too?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBecause of the scale of Weinstein\u2019s abuse and manipulations\u2014and the lengths he allegedly went to to cover them up\u2014there is a widely held assumption of complicity on Chapman\u2019s part. \u201cShe must have known\u201d is what so many people say at dinner parties. \u201cThe thing that pains me,\u201d says her friend the model and singer Karen Elson, \u201cis that when anyone finds out that I know George, that\u2019s the first thing they say. Like she is somehow responsible for his hideous behavior. When I say, \u2018Well, actually she didn\u2019t know,\u2019 it becomes this other judgment: \u2018How could she not have known?\u2019 Or: \u2018Well, that\u2019s on her if she didn\u2019t.\u2019 It\u2019s so complicated.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s complicated, but it is also the oldest story in the book. Even Chapman points out that\u2014putting aside the enormity of her situation\u2014women are betrayed by their husbands every day because they turn out to be not the men their wives thought they were. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be viewed as a victim,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t think I am. I am a woman in a shit situation, but it\u2019s not unique.\u201d\n\nChapman first met Weinstein socially, at a party, and they began dating on and off. \u201cI was living in England, and I had just come out of a relationship, so it was very slow.\u201d Was it a good marriage? \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this so incredibly painful: I had what I thought was a very happy marriage. I loved my life.\u201d Asked if she was ever suspicious about his behavior, she says, \u201cAbsolutely not. Never.\u201d For one thing, he traveled constantly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never been one of those people who obsesses about where someone is.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult now for people to imagine that there was ever anything good about Harvey Weinstein. But the fact remains that before all of the horrifying revelations, most people thought Weinstein could be an asshole and a bully, but they didn\u2019t think he was a monster. There is always that beauty-and-the-beast mystery: What does she see in him? When I ask Chapman what the initial attraction was, she says, \u201cWell, he\u2019s a wonderful father to my kids. But initially? He\u2019s charismatic. He\u2019s an incredibly bright, very learned man. And very charitable. He paid for a friend of mine\u2019s mother, who had breast cancer, to go to a top doctor. He was amazing like that. He is amazing like that. That is the tough part of this . . . this black-and-white thing . . . life isn\u2019t like that.\u201d When I tell her that a friend of the couple\u2019s told me that Weinstein gave Chapman confidence, she says, \u201cYes. Absolutely. He was a wonderful partner to me. He was a friend and a confidant and a supporter. Yes, he\u2019s a big personality. . . . And . . . but . . . I don\u2019t know. I wish I had the answers. But I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask the people who have known Chapman the longest what they thought of her marriage, the common thread is how surprised they were by it\u2014but for very different reasons. \u201cI first met him at a polo match,\u201d says Remanda, \u201cand I had no idea who he was. I know George very well, and she\u2019d had, like, two boyfriends before Harvey. So my initial reaction was, Whoa. He\u2019s older, he\u2019s brash, he\u2019s American. Who is he? We sat down and I think we laughed, belly-laughed, falling off our chairs, for two hours. I thought, She\u2019s going to marry this guy.\u201d\n\nOyelowo also vividly remembers the day he met Harvey. \u201cI was in my car on Mulholland Drive, and I got a call from George. She said, \u2018Come to Shutters on the Beach; I want you to meet my new boyfriend.\u2019 George was there, and the very famous producer Harvey Weinstein was there, and I was still waiting for the boyfriend to emerge until it sort of became evident: Oh, this is who she meant! And I will be 100 percent honest with you: I was very skeptical. But as time went on, as they got married, had children, there was no way of denying that this was a genuine couple.\u2019\u201d\n\nLast summer Chapman got to know Huma Abedin, a few months before the news of the allegations about Weinstein broke, during play dates between their sons. Now they are supertight. \u201cWe just . . . bonded,\u201d Abedin says and lets out a dark laugh. \u201cIn allll kinds of ways. This particular club, ironically, it\u2019s not such a small one: women who have had to endure it in such a public way, women like Georgina and me. People don\u2019t feel sorry for us; you don\u2019t get that empathy. People think you\u2019re beautiful, you\u2019re thin, you\u2019re rich, you\u2019re photographed on the red carpet, and you get stuck in this category. There\u2019s so much more depth beyond all that with Georgina.\u201d\n\nOver the summer, Abedin came to see that depth. \u201cYou look at her from the outside, if you don\u2019t know her, and you think, She\u2019s perfect,\u201d says Abedin. \u201cShe could be a model for the clothes she designs. But when you go to the house, she opens the door without any makeup on, and she\u2019s stunning, and she\u2019s funny and goofy with her children\u2014who are clearly the most important people in her life. She\u2019s at the stove making chicken fingers and French fries, and she\u2019s one of the realest people I know. There\u2019s nothing entitled about her. You believe she is someone who works really hard at being a good and present mom, and doing her job really well.\u201d\n\nA friend of Chapman\u2019s told me that, because of the divorce, money, the kids, Georgina is in regular contact with Harvey. I ask her, \u201cIs there anything you can say about his state of mind?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she replies with a roll of the eyes, \u201cnot really. Clearly when I was married to him I didn\u2019t know anything about his state of mind, so I\u2019m probably not the best person to ask.\u201d\n\nChapman\u2019s close circle is rallying around her and hoping she will have a fresh start. \u201cWhat I want for Georgina,\u201d says Elson, \u201cand it\u2019s going to take time, and it\u2019s impossible to come out unscathed, but let this be a moment in her life where she realizes that this is what made her. This is what made her a woman.\u201d When I ask Chapman if there\u2019s anything she can say about her finances, now much changed, and her future, she replies, \u201cI\u2019m just living moment to moment. Is it difficult? Of course. But one adjusts. Is it going to be for the worse? Maybe not.\u201d\n\nOn the day I visited her office, I noticed that Chapman kept checking her phone, like she was waiting for news. Turns out, she was: She had put a bid on a house in upstate New York\u2014a farm\u2014and was hoping to find out if the bid was accepted. \u201cFingers crossed,\u201d she said. With the sale of all the family homes\u2014in the Hamptons, Connecticut, and the West Village\u2014Chapman is trying to get herself and the children situated. \u201cAs soon as this happened, I had this crazy vision: I know what I need to do. I need to move to a farm upstate. My daughter loves riding; my son responds to animals. I need to build a farm.\u201d\n\nIndeed, when the kids came in after school. Dash was carrying an enormous stuffed giraffe, and India was galloping in like a horse. \u201cShe\u2019s obsessed,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cAnd when she\u2019s not with a horse she\u2019s pretending to be a horse. I\u2019ve had to look at my life, and maybe I\u2019m going to create something better for my children out of this.\u201d The farm, she says, is \u201crambling, it\u2019s magical, it\u2019s private, down a long driveway. And it\u2019s connected to horse trails, so you can just ride off of the property. I promised the kids donkeys and goats.\u201d\n\nChapman finds out that I live in Woodstock, New York, and brings up Neil Gaiman, who also has a house there. They met when she hired him to write the screenplay for a ten-minute short she directed in 2013; Gaiman had collaborated with Weinstein on Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Princess Mononoke. \u201cNeil still possesses that magical quality of having a child\u2019s imagination,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you see the way that he works and the way that he thinks, it just reminds me of how one thought when one was younger\u2014that sense of endless possibility, just pure . . . untrapped creativity.\u201d The word untrapped hung in the air.\n\nUnlike other friends of Chapman\u2019s, Gaiman did actually worry about her being married to Weinstein. \u201cOne reason is that I watched the person he tried to be when he was around her\u2014which was sort of, at least to some degree, uxorious\u2014which was not the person that he tried to be the rest of the time. But I never felt that there was anything going on other than that Georgina was actually in love with him. There\u2019s that point where Harvey stops being a person and becomes a cultural phenomenon, though it is worth reminding people that there are human beings here. And that one of those human beings could be affable and charming if he wished to be and also bullying and deceitful. And he was obviously very good at this.\u201d He pauses for a long while and says, finally, \u201cShe\u2019s a good person who married a bad person. Or, if you want to be less judgmental, she\u2019s a good person who married a person who did some terrible things. And who now has to make a go of it on her own. And I know she can. And I\u2019m sure she will.\u201d\n\nIn this story:\n\nSittings Editor: Tabitha Simmons.\n\nHair: Benoit Moeyaert; Makeup: Gucci Westman.\n\nSet Design: Mary Howard.", "images": ["https://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5af35b2173084b3aba5248e3/16:9/pass/gc-vogue-june-2018.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5af35b2173084b3aba5248e3/16:9/pass/gc-vogue-june-2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Van Meter", "Annie Leibovitz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/georgina-chapman-life-after-harvey-weinstein", "title": "Georgina Chapman on Life After Harvey Weinstein", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/georgina-chapman-life-after-harvey-weinstein", "title": "Georgina Chapman on Life After Harvey Weinstein", "description": "When numerous women spoke out about Harvey Weinstein, his wife remained silent\u2014until now.
