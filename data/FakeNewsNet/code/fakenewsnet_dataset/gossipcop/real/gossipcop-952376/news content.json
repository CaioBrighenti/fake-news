So what exactly is her secret to showing up to every job, booking or photoshoot looking like a million bucks?\n\nThe beauty has given birth to four children and still looks like the model she was before she had kids when she started in the 90s over 20 years ago.\n\nKlum is finally revealing her secret. She loves to exfoliate.\n\nWhat\u2019s even better is that her favorite exfoliating scrub can be found at drugstores in the UK. It\u2019s called Aapri.\n\nKlum believes that it\u2019s essential to exfoliate twice a week as it helps to rejuvenate the skin.\n\nThis also helps to prompt the skin to turn over and be made new quicker as this is a natural process our skin does over time.\n\nScrubs like this can help to get rid of the dead skin that accumulates on the face and body.\n\nThe model, mom and TV personality says she tries to keep it simple when it comes to her skincare. She also loves Mario Badescu\u2019s Buttermilk Creme.\n\nAnother important tip that she swears by is letting her skin rest.\n\nThe beauty keeps makeup to an absolute minimum when she isn\u2019t on set.\n\nMakeup, dirt, and debris easily clog up the pores of the skin. This can lead to breakouts, sensitivities, and skin that starts to look less elastic. So letting the skin breathe is essential.\n\nWhile genes certainly have something to do with it, Klum doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s that hard to maintain a serious radiance and glow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpensive products are also not necessary in the grand scheme of what can be used to nourish and treat skin.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Heidi-Klum-Tom-Kaulitz-Flaunting-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/avatar_user_39_1503571085-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Heidi-Klum-BlogSpot.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maxresdefault-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/olivia-munn-1-300x218.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Webp.net-resizeimage-25.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Tiny-Harris-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3-300x187.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Heidi-Klum-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cassie-Ventura-Alex-Fine-Diddy-300x244.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Webp.net-resizeimage-25.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Serene Hughes", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/heidi-klum-reveals-her-secret-to-staying-a-timeless-glowing-beauty-170092/", "title": "Heidi Klum Reveals Her Secret To Staying A Timeless, Glowing Beauty", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Serene Hughes", "news_keywords": "heidi klum,", "keywords": "celebrity news, heidi klum,", "description": "With a modeling career that spans decades and numerous other gigs that have kept her in front of the camera steadily adding to her legacy, Heidi Klum", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Heidi Klum Reveals Her Secret To Staying A Timeless, Glowing Beauty", "description": "With a modeling career that spans decades and numerous other gigs that have kept her in front of the camera steadily adding to her legacy, Heidi Klum", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/heidi-klum-reveals-her-secret-to-staying-a-timeless-glowing-beauty-170092/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Webp.net-resizeimage-25.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-17", "modified_time": "2018-07-17", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/serenehughes/", "section": "Fashion", "tag": "heidi klum"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531800000.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
