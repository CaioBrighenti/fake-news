Fortunately, audience members inside the house clarified over Twitter, reporting that De Niro said, \u201cI\u2019m going to say this \u2014 F\u2014 TRUMP. It\u2019s no longer \u2018Down with Trump,\u2019 it\u2019s F\u2014 TRUMP.\u201d\n\nAfter the thunderous applause died down, De Niro continued, \u201cNow I\u2019ll get to this introduction\u2026 Bruce, you can rock the house like nobody else and even more important in these perilous times, you rock the vote always fighting for truth, transparency, and integrity in government. Boy, do we need that now.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The best moments from the 2018 Tony Awards\n\nDe Niro has made no bones about his opposition to Donald Trump and his administration, having previously gone on a profanity-laced tirade against the president at the National Board of Review awards gala. The actor also popped up several times on Saturday Night Live this past season playing Robert Mueller, the lead investigator in a case looking into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actor also joked that the difficulty of getting a ticket to Springsteen\u2019s Broadway show was why he had agreed to present at the Tony Awards. De Niro said, \u201cDo you have any idea how hard it is to get tickets for Bruce Springsteen\u2019s show on Broadway? It\u2019s easier to get tickets for Hamilton.\u201c\n\nRELATED: The Tony Awards celebrate underdogs with joy and flair: EW review\n\nSpringsteen then went on to deliver a soulful rendition of \u201cMy Hometown\u201d along with an excerpt from the monologuing text of his one-man show. Earlier in the evening, Billy Joel presented him with his Special Tony Award.\n\nCheck out the full list of Tony winners.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/151075_7572.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/qeye_406_unit_00222r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hills.jpg?crop=331px%2C70px%2C2268px%2C1190px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/teri-hatcher-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2e8796fac4d868172fac0ab0310aeefe?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-bachelorette-1-2000.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dressing-funny-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bautista.jpg?crop=0px%2C108px%2C3000px%2C1577px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tony-hale.jpg?crop=285px%2C113px%2C2415px%2C1269px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/115233_0986b-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/netflix-logo.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/115254_1236.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/m52_promo_stills_022519.0059_r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/nup_187413_1353.jpg?crop=0px%2C121px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/m53_promo_stills_022519.0020_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/150501_9516.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-859458252.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/aziz-ansari-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/big-brother-1-2000-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/shutterstock_editorial_9709240ea_huge.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/shutterstock_editorial_9709240ea_huge.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maureen Lee Lenker"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/theater/2018/06/10/robert-de-niro-gets-censored-for-saying-f-trump-at-tony-awards/", "title": "Robert De Niro gets censored for saying 'F\u2014 Trump' at Tony Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Bruce Springsteen,Robert De Niro", "news_keywords": "Bruce Springsteen,Robert De Niro", "description": "While introducing a performance from Bruce Springsteen, De Niro got political.", "og": {"title": "Robert De Niro gets censored for saying 'F\u2014 Trump' at Tony Awards", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/theater/2018/06/10/robert-de-niro-gets-censored-for-saying-f-trump-at-tony-awards/", "description": "You talking to me?
