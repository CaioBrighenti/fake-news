In Live+Same Day viewing, the season averaged a 0.2 rating in adults 18-49 and around 400,000 viewers per episode, down approximately 30% in the key demo from Season 3. Sources say that the show could continue at the cable network Pop, which is a joint venture between CBS Entertainment and Lionsgate Entertainment. Though sources also caution that any deal with Pop is by no means final, it would make sense given that Lionsgate Television co-produces \"The Royals\" with Universal Cable Productions.", "images": ["https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/OAGp03hXN5wtNr2kd_7mEUAtxdQ=/1200x0/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QCYJCA3TSFHKZAIBTEGLY2ZMUU.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/yB3bNG2aSfAwtGi9hZ1RESiUcqg=/90x90/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NHBLEPKMKFD5DPOIGEZ3Z7YRAE.jpg", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/pb/resources/images/ct_icons/app-bar-logo.svg?v=160", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Fl0a4V0Kn-qy8oNZjP8U0BzeA-w=/415x311/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QCYJCA3TSFHKZAIBTEGLY2ZMUU.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/OAGp03hXN5wtNr2kd_7mEUAtxdQ=/1200x0/top/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QCYJCA3TSFHKZAIBTEGLY2ZMUU.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-the-royals-canceled-20180816-story.html", "title": "'The Royals' canceled after four seasons at E!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "language": "English (United States), en-US", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019, Chicago Tribune", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "date": "2018-08-16T21:31:00Z", "description": "\"The Royals'\" reign has come to an end.
