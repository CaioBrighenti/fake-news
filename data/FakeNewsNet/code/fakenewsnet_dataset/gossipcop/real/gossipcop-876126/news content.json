PEOPLE caught up with Jenner backstage as she sat down between the Hadid sisters, who were getting their makeup done by lead makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury, before the show.\n\nImage zoom Kendall Jenner David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to be back. We\u2019re all together again,\u201d Jenner tells us exclusively as she pointed to Gigi and Bella.\n\nJenner\u2019s hair was styled in textured, loose waves by lead hairstylist Anthony Turner, and she rocked a dewy, golden goddess makeup look, which she\u2019ll have when she walks the runway.\n\nImage zoom Gigi Hadid David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nImage zoom Bella Hadid David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe supermodel also reveals that the Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel Halloween costume she wore with her sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner came in handy when it came to preparing for her return to the VS catwalk.\n\n\u201cI did [get my practice in]. I actually didn\u2019t even think of it like that until I got into the outfit and I was like, \u2018Oh wow, this was good,'\u201d Jenner says. \u201cIt was so much fun.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, she couldn\u2019t choose just one sister she would love to actually walk down the runway with. \u201cAll of them. Every single one of them,\u201d Jenner says.\n\nLooking for more style content?

In her contract, a no-compete clause reportedly ensured she couldn\u2019t walk in the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show. But it appears Jenner\u2019s contract with the luxury lingerie designer has since ended, which is likely why she was able to return for 2018.\n\nRELATED: Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show 2018 Model Roster: Who\u2019s In and Who\u2019s Out?\n\nThe supermodel first made her debut on the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show runway in 2015. She walked for a second time at the Paris show in 2016, which was a momentous occasion when Jenner donned the show\u2019s coveted wings.\n\nImage zoom Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty\n\nFor her first look, Jenner wore a colorful red and gold look, which featured bustier-style lace red bra, a tiny lace thong, thigh-high gold and aqua-embellished red boots and huge feather blue wings. To add on to her heavy wings, the model piled on colorful chunky jewelry.\n\nImage zoom Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty\n\nHer second look didn\u2019t feature wings quite as big, but nonetheless, she still got them. This sexy maid-inspired outfit featured feathered black wings and a lacy black and white tuxedo-esque bra and panties.\n\nJenner opened up to InStyle before her 2016 runway appearance about her pre-show jitters, even after walking plenty of other high-profile runways. \u201cI\u2019m so excited, and nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cLast year, I had two looks that were very covered in certain spots. But this year, I have one look that is kind of covered and one that is pretty exposed \u2014 so I\u2019m a little nervous about that!\u201d", "images":
