It can lead to tremors, difficulty moving, speech changes and eventually memory problems.\n\nDiamond hopes to continue writing and recording for some time to come, a post on his website reads.\n\nImage caption As well as his own hits, Diamond wrote the famous Monkees track I'm a Believer\n\n\"My thanks goes out to my loyal and devoted audiences around the world,\" he said. \"You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement.\"\n\nWith a nod to his hit Sweet Caroline, he added: \"This ride has been 'so good, so good, so good' thanks to you.\"\n\nDiamond, who has sold over 130 million albums worldwide, is set to receive a lifetime achievement award at Sunday's Grammy Awards.\n\nThe singer last performed in the UK and Ireland in October as part of the 50th anniversary world tour, but the the onset of Parkinson's disease \"has made it difficult to travel and perform on a large scale basis,\" his official website said.\n\nFriends and fans sent their best wishes to the singer on social media as news of his retirement spread.\n\n\"Keep fighting, old buddy. You've got a long way to go yet,\" tweeted singer Nancy Sinatra.\n\n\"Endless admiration and love to you,\" wrote musician Josh Groban.\n\nRolling Stone contributing editor David Wild said Diamond was behind \"the kindest thing any star ever did for me\".", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13146/production/_99705187_neildiamond.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=entertainment_and_arts::news.entertainment_and_arts.story.42784305.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:36a165af-3047-1843-9672-293f171e5f96]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-0.9.1-nojs]&x10=[NEWS_GNL]&x11=[NEWS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13146/production/_99705187_neildiamond.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13146/production/_99705187_neildiamond.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42784305", "title": "Neil Diamond retires from touring after Parkinson's diagnosis", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Singer Neil Diamond stops touring \"with great reluctance\" after a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.", "x-country": "us", "x-audience": "US", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "US", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 114825984, "og": {"title": "Neil Diamond quits touring due to Parkinson's", "type": "article", "description": "Singer Neil Diamond stops touring \"with great reluctance\" after a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42784305", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13146/production/_99705187_neildiamond.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
