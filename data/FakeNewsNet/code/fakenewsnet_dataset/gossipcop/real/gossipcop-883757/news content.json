Why? Because of something Karen Walker (Megan Mullally) said in the premiere, in her characteristic blunt way: \u201cNobody wants to see you two raise kids.\u201d\n\nSo, how, exactly, did the writers sidestep acknowledging the finale\u2014which found Will and Grace (Eric McCormack and Debra Messing) drifting apart as they each began to raise children with their respective spouses? Simple: they employed one of the oldest tricks in the sitcom book.\n\nThe premiere opens on Will and Grace playing a game in the living room as Jack (Sean Hayes) watches and Karen stares into space. Eventually, the three decide to revive their friend. Jack takes the lead by shaking a bottle of pills from her purse in Karen\u2019s ear. She shoots up instantly, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening? Who won the election?\u201d\n\nEveryone in the room sullenly informs Karen that her guy\u2014Donald Trump, obviously\u2014won, at which point she tells the group, \u201cI had the craziest dream.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill was living with a swarthy man in uniform,\u201d Karen says, describing where we left him in the original series finale\u2014\u201cand Grace was married to a Jew doctor.\u201d Will then informs her that while both he and Grace did have long-term partners, they\u2019re single again now. When Karen asks what happened to the kids both Will and Grace had\u2014who grew up to marry one another in the original finale\u2014that\u2019s where reality starts to diverge.\n\n\u201cThat never happened,\u201d Will says, to which Karen replies, \u201cOh, what a relief! Nobody wants to see you two raise kids.\u201d\n\nOnce it\u2019s established that Will and Grace are actually living together again while Grace recovers from her divorce from Leo, Karen has just two more questions: is she still rich, and is her husband Stan still alive?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re rich,\u201d Will tells her. \u201cStan\u2019s alive.\u201d He gestures toward himself and Grace as he recaps, \u201cBoth single, no kids.\u201d\n\nThen Jack chimes in with the kicker: a fourth wall-breaking wink, and a stern \u201cgot it?\u201d\n\nFrom there, the show goes on as though nothing has changed since the old series. Psst, Roseanne\u2014maybe you should take notes.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cab9d9df8524309461f0fd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/will-and-grace-review.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5991c80c7d88354be1ed43db/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TV-Couches-SS01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d03acff76711f312e7fe6b3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Jeffrey-Katzenberg%25E2%2580%2599s-Quibi.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cbe64f73a8876bfb18da0d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/will-and-grace-interviews-lede.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cd5e7aaa27f92b091aeaed/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/will-and-grace-premiere.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5991c80d38291d36bb48bdef/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TV-Couches-SS02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a7351550fa880df89f5559/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/will-and-grace-first-look.png", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cd5e7aaa27f92b091aeaed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/will-and-grace-premiere.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d24a3b38d44360009846675/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/bachelorette-jed-hometown-cheating-instagram.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5991c80d2c6c7a532a1c90e6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TV-Couches-SS03.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cd5e7aaa27f92b091aeaed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/will-and-grace-premiere.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Laura Bradley", "Richard Lawson", "Nicole Sperling", "Laura Bradle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/will-and-grace-revival-premiere-recap-finale", "title": "Will &amp; Grace: How the Revival Torpedoed Its Original Series Finale", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Will and Grace\u2019s falling-out, spouses, and children were all erased with the help of a classic TV trope.", "keywords": "will & grace,nbc,television", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Will and Grace\u2019s falling-out, spouses, and children were all erased with the help of a classic TV trope.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cd5e7aaa27f92b091aeaed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/will-and-grace-premiere.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Will &amp; Grace: How the Revival Torpedoed Its Original Series Finale", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/will-and-grace-revival-premiere-recap-finale"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Will and Grace\u2019s falling-out, spouses, and children were all erased with the help of a classic TV trope.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cd5e7aaa27f92b091aeaed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/will-and-grace-premiere.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Will &amp; Grace: How the Revival Torpedoed Its Original Series Finale"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
