Thanks for marrying me.\" She capped it off with the hashtag \"annualdisneyadventure.\"\n\n\"The Big Bang Theory\" alum's Instagram story also showed pictures of the happy couple going on Splash Mountain, Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain.\n\nThe couple also took time to celebrate Cuoco's 33rd birthday, which is Nov. 30, a few days early. Cuoco's Instagram story includes a photo of the couple with a Mickey Mouse-themed cake at the amusement park with the hashtag \"club33disneyland.\"\n\nCook popped the question on Cuoco's birthday last year. The two also took a trip to Disneyland last December, a few weeks after they got engaged, and they tied the knot at a ranch near San Diego this past June.\n\nCuoco certainly likes to commemorate the milestones in her relationship with Cook. In October, she also went on Instagram to celebrate their three-month wedding anniversary.\n\nHere's to many more anniversaries and trips to Disneyland for the two!", "images": ["https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389903/kaley-cuoco-today-main-181126_a7c1b1a82bf4cb133d1056f05d3b50e7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389903/kaley-cuoco-today-main-181126_a7c1b1a82bf4cb133d1056f05d3b50e7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/kaley-cuoco-karl-cook-celebrate-one-year-their-engagement-t143867", "title": "Kaley Cuoco and Karl Cook celebrate one year since their engagement", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/kaley-cuoco-karl-cook-celebrate-one-year-their-engagement-t143867", "title": "Kaley Cuoco celebrates engagement anniversary at Disneyland \u2014 see the pic", "description": "The couple has a romance fit for the happiest place on Earth!", "image": {"identifier": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389903/kaley-cuoco-today-main-181126_a7c1b1a82bf4cb133d1056f05d3b50e7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389903/kaley-cuoco-today-main-181126_a7c1b1a82bf4cb133d1056f05d3b50e7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389903/kaley-cuoco-today-main-181126_a7c1b1a82bf4cb133d1056f05d3b50e7.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Kaley Cuoco celebrates engagement anniversary at Disneyland \u2014 see the pic", "description": "The couple has a romance fit for the happiest place on Earth!", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Kaley Cuoco and husband Karl Cook took to Disneyland to commemorate Cuoco's the 1-year anniversary of their engagement and Cuoco's upcoming birthday.", "thumbnail": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389903/kaley-cuoco-today-main-181126_a7c1b1a82bf4cb133d1056f05d3b50e7.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543267849.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
