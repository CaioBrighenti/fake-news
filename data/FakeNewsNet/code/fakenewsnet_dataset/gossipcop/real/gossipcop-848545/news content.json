Now, a source tells PEOPLE Disick \u201chated Younes\u201d and is \u201chappy things are over.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing Kourtney date Younes definitely played into his partying,\u201d said the source of Disick, 35, who initially reacted to Kardashian and Bendjima\u2019s blossoming romance with tit-for-tat trysts in Cannes last year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never gotten over her and was really hoping to get her back when she first started dating Younes,\u201d the source adds.\n\nOf course, Disick has been dating 19-year-old Sofia Richie since the fall \u2014 but according to the source, he would \u201cget back together with Kourtney in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\n\u201cSofia makes him happy but they are also very on and off,\u201d the source says. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising if Scott tried to pursue things again with Kourtney down the line.\u201d\n\nBut a second source tells PEOPLE that Kardashian is \u201chappy being single for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cKourtney is doing great,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe isn\u2019t seeing Younes. After all the drama with Scott over the years, she wasn\u2019t going to put up with any drama from Younes. She cut him off. She is focused on her kids and herself.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Orange Is the New Black Star Jackie Cruz Recalls Kourtney Kardashian Kiss\n\nKardashian and Bendjima had been going strong as recently as last month, when they took a romantic European vacation joined in part by the three kids she shares with Disick. In the wake of their sudden split, a source told PEOPLE that \u201cit didn\u2019t end well\u201d \u2014 not to mention the fact that the news broke as photos surfaced of Bendjima getting cozy with another woman in Mexico. (He insisted she was just a friend.)\n\nBut while Disick may be happy that Bendjima is out of the picture, it seems unlikely that the longtime exes will rekindle their romance, with an insider telling PEOPLE last week that \u201cKourtney will never get back with Scott.\u201d\n\nThe two ended their nine-year relationship in July 2015 and share sons Mason, 8, Reign, 3, and daughter Penelope, 5. According to the insider, Kardashian is pleased that Disick has been focused on fatherhood lately.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s happy that he\u2019s doing well and spending a lot of time with the kids,\u201d the insider said. \u201cShe\u2019s happy about co-parenting with Scott, but that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nOn a recent episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Disick said he was happy with Richie but admitted, \u201cWe always said we would try to get back together when we were like 40.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kourtney Kardashian Says Ex Scott Disick \u2018Will Always Be Family\u2019\n\nImage zoom Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat\n\nHer famous family seems to be rooting for a romantic reunion. While celebrating Kylie Jenner\u2018s 21st birthday last week, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian shared a video of her newly single sister sitting next to Disick at the birthday bash.\n\n\u201cA girl can dream,\u201d she captioned the post.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630",
