Both Gabrielle Anwar (Burn Notice) and Dania Ramirez (Devious Maids) have signed on as full-fledged series regulars, while Adelaide Kane (Reign), Mekia Cox (Chicago Med), and Rose Reynolds (Poldark) have been given recurring roles.\n\nAs of now, details about the five latest additions are scarce, but expect some new information to trickle down at the Once Upon a Time panel at Comic Con San Diego.\n\nClearly, things weren\u2019t looking so good for the show after it lost key cast members Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Emile de Ravin, Jared Gilmore, and Rebecca Mader in a rather shocking casting shake-up. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see if the show\u2019s newest additions can fill in the void left by these beloved characters.\n\ntumblr\n\nAs shown in the Season 6 finale, the forthcoming season will revolve around a very grown-up Henry (played by The Walking Dead\u2019s Andrew J. West) and his daughter Lucy (Jane the Virgin\u2019s Alison Fernandez). Lana Parrilla, Colin O\u2019Donoghue, and Robert Carlyle will all return in their staple roles and join forces with adult Henry and Lucy to face the greatest challenge that the residents of the Enchanted Forest have ever encountered.\n\nOnce Upon a Time returns to ABC on Fridays at 8 p.m. A premiere date for the new fall season has yet to be announced.\n\nRelated Articles:", "images": ["http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/G9cnOOZ66jox.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-124BfeS-bwiSE.gif?labels=", "http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/h-Zr8wi3M6cm.jpg", "http://www3.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/Ni9tp2o_gjHm.jpg", "http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/RxT9O1bXMeBm.jpg", "http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/od/GY6sN4qlLBp/R1k2c040cWx/225x150.jpg", "http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/j-AZCSuqt51m.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?c1=2&c2=6167726&comscorekw=", "http://www.zimbio.com/images/logo_Zimbio_Main_v06816.png", "http://www.zimbio.com/images/logo_Zimbio_32x86.png", "http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/od/I6bQiSgdwGm/STZiUWlTZ2R/225x150.jpg", "http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/vcXpUYvscUdc.jpg", "http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/od/zdgxdeR6gAp/emRneGRlUjZ/225x150.jpg", "http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/od/QOv5AZ2IPZE/UU92NUFaMkl/225x150.jpg", "http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/EEeEv6hLOKmm.jpg", "http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/uBEQTD1PTvix.gif", "http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/G9cnOOZ66jol.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/G9cnOOZ66jox.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Areeba Abid", "Http", "Www.Zimbio.Com Team Areebaabid", "I'M The Tv Editor At Zimbio.
