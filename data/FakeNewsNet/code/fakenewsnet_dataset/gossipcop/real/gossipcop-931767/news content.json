I'm sure you have a very logical explanation to all this,'\" T.I. said. \"Like, 'what's happening? What's the punchline?'\"\n\nHe said West's answer was simple.\n\n\"He said 'Man, just being a free thinker, man,\" T.I. said.\n\nWhen asked about famously wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat, West's explanation was a bit more complex.\n\n\"Man, my subconscious spoke to my conscious and it just moved me to wear the hat,\" T.I. quoted West saying.\n\nSince then West has raised even more ire by saying slavery in America was \"a choice.\"\n\nT.I., who met with the rapper before the slavery comment, said West didn't really think about how his actions have hurt people. He said it's difficult for most people to relate to how West thinks.\n\n\"A miniscule percentage of the population of the Earth that speaks the language of Kanye West,\" T.I. said. \"The things that come into his mind, once they hit the air it probably don't sound the same to the average (expletive) that's listening to it as it did in his head. So he needs kind of like a translator.\"", "images": ["https://media.wfmz.com/mara-wfmz-media-us-east-1/photo/2018/05/03/Rapper%20TI.jpg_11347290_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9953676&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.channel4000.com/media.etgdemo.com/photo_qa/2016/04/04/logo-lakana_52307_ver1.0.png", "https://media.wfmz.com/mara-wfmz-media-us-east-1/photo/2016/06/23/Updated%20Logo_2876617_ver1.0.png", "https://www.wfmz.com/wfmz-main-theme/images/placeholder/placeholder-16x9.jpg", "https://media.wfmz.com/mara-wfmz-media-us-east-1/photo/2018/05/03/Rapper%20TI.jpg_11347290_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "https://media.wfmz.com/mara-wfmz-media-us-east-1/photo/2016/10/27/logo-main_1317718_ver1.0.png"], "top_img": "https://media.wfmz.com/mara-wfmz-media-us-east-1/photo/2018/05/03/Rapper%20TI.jpg_11347290_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wfmz.com/entertainment/fellow-rapper-ti-says-he-is-not-giving-up-on-kanye-west/737798105", "title": "Fellow rapper T.I. says he is not giving up on Kanye West", "meta_data": {"author": "LISA RESPERS FRANCE, CNN", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kanye West has angered a lot of people with his Twitter rants, but fellow rapper T.I. is not willing to turn his back on him.", "keywords": "Feature", "og": {"title": "Fellow rapper T.I. says he is not giving up on Kanye West", "description": "Kanye West has angered a lot of people with his Twitter rants, but fellow rapper T.I. is not willing to turn his back on him.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.wfmz.com/entertainment/fellow-rapper-ti-says-he-is-not-giving-up-on-kanye-west/737798105", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.wfmz.com/mara-wfmz-media-us-east-1/photo/2018/05/03/Rapper%20TI.jpg_11347290_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "WFMZ"}, "fb": {"app_id": 236814379695677, "pages": 37677635556}, "article": {"section": "Entertainment", "tag": "t.i., kanye west", "published_time": "2018-05-03T14:34:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-03T14:34:03+00:00", "expiration_time": "2023-05-02T14:19:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fellow rapper T.I. says he is not giving up on Kanye West", "description": "Kanye West has angered a lot of people with his Twitter rants, but fellow rapper T.I. is not willing to turn his back on him.", "site": "WFMZ", "image": "https://media.wfmz.com/mara-wfmz-media-us-east-1/photo/2018/05/03/Rapper%20TI.jpg_11347290_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "domain": "https://www.wfmz.com"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525358043.0, "source": "http://www.wfmz.com", "summary": ""}
