Before his Instagram post, Glaze told the New York Times in an interview published earlier Wednesday that he was \u201ca tad bit uncomfortable.\u201d The newspaper reported that he had put off his first kiss and \u201cwanted to save it for my first relationship. I wanted it to be special.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould I have done it if she said, \u2018Would you kiss me?\u2019 No, I would have said no,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cI know a lot of guys would be like, \u2018Heck yeah!\u2019 But for me, I was raised in a conservative family and I was uncomfortable immediately. I wanted my first kiss to be special.\u201d\n\n[\u2018American Idol\u2019 premiere: Three takeaways from a show that may actually never end]\n\nThe Times also reported that he didn\u2019t feel he had been harassed by Perry and was grateful she tweeted about him. Since the October audition, Glaze said he has talked it over with friends, and they agreed with him the kiss \u201cdidn\u2019t really count. It was lip contact versus a romantic situation with someone you care about. That\u2019s what a real first kiss is.\u201d\n\nStill, the interview and subsequent attention on the audition sparked criticism of Perry, including calling it a \u201c#HimToo\u201d moment and arguing that the exchange would have been considered assault had an older male judge kissed an unsuspecting 19-year-old girl.\n\nSo Katy Perry basically sexually assaulted someone on American Idol. If the genders were reversed, not only would there have been a firing, but perhaps an arrest as well.

I do wish I would have performed better in the moment. I should have picked another song to sing and calmed myself down regardless of the kiss. I should have been able to perform under pressure.\u201d\n\nGlaze, who at the time of his audition was a 19-year-old cashier from Enid, Okla., walked in and told the judges he liked his job because he could meet cute girls. Judge Luke Bryan, quoting a Perry song, asked Glaze, \u201cHave you kissed a girl and liked it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never been in a relationship,\u201d the contestant responded.\n\nPerry asked, \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t kiss a girl without being in a relationship,\u201d Glaze said.\n\nPerry then ordered him over, and offered him her cheek as the Bryan and judge Lionel Richie egged them on. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even make a smush sound!\u201d Perry said, and they repeated it again.\n\nBut as he went in for another kiss on the cheek, Perry quickly moved her lips over to meet his. He fell to the ground with a nervous grin and a shocked expression, as Perry and the judges celebrated.\n\n\u201cKaty!\u201d he yelled. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a first.\u201d\n\nHe clearly seemed nervous after the exchange and asked for water before he sang. He then gave what the judges deemed a hurried and lackluster performance. Perry said, \u201cI really enjoyed meeting you,\u201d but \u201cthere are some people who are just out-singing you right now, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be fair to put you in that kind of competition.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cNext time, just take a little bit more time. You were a bit rushed.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n\u2018American Idol\u2019 is officially back.
