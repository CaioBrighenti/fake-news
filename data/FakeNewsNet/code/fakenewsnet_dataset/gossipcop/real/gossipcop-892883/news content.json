The story is loosely based on the historical mystery revolving around the disappearance of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna after a fateful night in 1916. Fox had previously adapted the story into a live-action film starring Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brynner in 1956.\n\nAnastasia went on to earn $139 million, receive two Oscar nominations and even inspire a stage adaptation of the musical film that premiered on Broadway in April 2017.\n\nTo celebrate the legacy of the 20th anniversary of the film's release, The Hollywood Reporter travels on a quick \"journey to the past\" to track the careers of the voice actors who brought Anastasia to life once upon a November.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_landscape_960x541/2017/11/meg_ryan_and_anastasia_-_split_-_photofest_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_square_270x270/2019/07/graham_fletcher-cook_obit_-_publicity_-_p_2019.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_square_270x270/2019/06/spider-man-_far_from_home-publicity_still_6-h_2019.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_landscape_960x541/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_square_270x270/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tara Bitran"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/cast-anastasia-1060209", "title": "The Cast of 'Anastasia,' Then and Now", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Twenty years ago, a cast of star-studded greats lent their voices to the tale of an ill-fated Russian princess with a happy ending in Fox Animation's first feature.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/cast-anastasia-1060209", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "The Cast of 'Anastasia,' Then and Now", "description": "Twenty years ago, a cast of star-studded greats lent their voices to the tale of an ill-fated Russian princess with a happy ending in Fox Animation's first feature.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "The Cast of 'Anastasia,' Then and Now", "description": "Twenty years ago, a cast of star-studded greats lent their voices to the tale of an ill-fated Russian princess with a happy ending in Fox Animation's first feature.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/cast-anastasia-1060209", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "The Cast of 'Anastasia,' Then and Now", "sailthru.description": "Twenty years ago, a cast of star-studded greats lent their voices to the tale of an ill-fated Russian princess with a happy ending in Fox Animation's first feature.", "sailthru.author": "Tara Bitran", "sailthru.vertical": "Movies", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-21 06:00:00", "sailthru.tags": "Movies"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511262000.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
