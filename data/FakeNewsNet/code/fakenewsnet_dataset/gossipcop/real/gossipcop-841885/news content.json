Do you think you know everything there is to know about each of the members? I bet you do, but if you want to go beyond as a super fan, you need to expand your knowledge past the singers in Fifth Harmony. A real fan makes it a point to know about their favorite band's inner circle and family members. For starters, does Fifth Harmony's Camila Cabello have any siblings?\n\nIf you are a genuine fan, you probably already know the answer to that question, but it can't hurt to learn more about Camila and her fam. And if you don't know, Camila has an adorable 7-year-old sister named Sofia. The younger Cabello has just as much spunk and sass as her older sister. In fact, Sofia seems to be a budding star herself. She loves to sing and dance just like her older sister.\n\nEven though she is only seven, videos of Sofia Cabello probably have more views than anything you've ever posted online. Maybe the girls should change the name of the band from Fifth Harmony to Sixth Harmony? Check out the cuteness that is Sofia Cabello.\n\nShe Looks Just like Her Sister\n\nHow cute is she!? Sofia looks just like her sister Camila.\n\nShe Loves To Perform\n\nYouTube\n\nSee, I'm not the only one who thinks she should join Fifth Harmony. The little lady has skills.\n\nShe Is Known As The Butterfly Queen\n\nSofia is featured in many of Camila's Instagram photos and is referred to as the \"butterfly queen\" in the caption. I guess she loves butterflies?\n\nShe Loves To Be Silly\n\nSofia had fun in this family video that her sister posted. What an adorable little sister.\n\nShe Is Close With Camila\n\nCamila has made it well known how close the bond is between herself and her little sister. I bet we will see more from Sofia Cabello in the years to come.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/rehost/2016/9/13/84981fa4-e97f-49c5-8ba1-d7bc3b923cc6.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.bustle.com/bustle/production/public/loading-d7a38c.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/rehost/2016/9/13/84981fa4-e97f-49c5-8ba1-d7bc3b923cc6.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/rehost/2016/9/13/84981fa4-e97f-49c5-8ba1-d7bc3b923cc6.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/60673-does-fifth-harmonys-camila-cabello-have-siblings-there-might-be-a-rising-star-in-the-family", "title": "Does Fifth Harmony's Camila Cabello Have Siblings?
