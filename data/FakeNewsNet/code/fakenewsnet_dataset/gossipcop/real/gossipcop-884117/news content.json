Online.\n\nThe political sketch poked fun at Trump's tweets and his responses to the crisis in Puerto Rico.\n\nEarlier this week the network announced that Chris Redd, Heidi Gardner and Luke Null had signed on as the season 43's new featured players.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9254297&cv=2.0&cj=1",
