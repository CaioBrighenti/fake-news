Photo: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images\n\nScarlett Johansson made the most controversial outfit decision at last night\u2019s Met Gala, and it didn\u2019t even involve a Pope hat. The actress, who was accompanied by her official boyfriend Colin Jost, wore a pink-and-red tulle gown designed by Marchesa, the line founded by Harvey Weinstein\u2019s ex-wife Georgina Chapman. This marks the first time a major celebrity has worn Marchesa to a red carpet event since the Weinstein allegations broke.\n\nScarlett Johansson and Colin Jost.

But recently Marchesa has made efforts to rehabilitate its image, with co-founder Keren Craig telling Refinery29 that the brand wants to support the #MeToo movement.\n\nIn a quote provided to the Cut, Johansson said that she wore Marchesa because she wanted to show her support for the women behind the brand. \u201cI wore Marchesa because their clothes make women feel confident and beautiful and it is my pleasure to support a brand created by two incredibly talented and important female designers,\u201d she said. Endorsing Chapman\u2019s line appears to be Johansson\u2019s tacit way of saying that women shouldn\u2019t be penalized for the crimes of the men in their lives, something that many #MeToo supporters will likely be able to get on board with.\n\n\u201cWe are truly honored that Scarlett chose to wear Marchesa for the Met Gala,\u201d said Marchesa in a statement. \u201cShe is an amazingly talented actor who has incredible style and presence. It was wonderful to work so closely with her in creating this custom look.\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated throughout.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/11/MM0143_LG_VALENTINO_5617_31_V4.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-alien-area-51.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-helen-mirren.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-belle-delphine.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/party-pics/party-pics-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/08/08-scarlett-johansson.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-alligator-lagoon.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/08/8-Ghislaine-Maxwell.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-serena-williams-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-quilt.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/07/12/sales/12-Sales-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/08/08-scarlett-johansson-colin-jost.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-donald-trump-aubrey-o-day.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-allie-long-1.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-Marc-Veyrat-cheddar.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/07/11/outdoor-voices-micro/11-outdoor-voices-lede.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/08/08-scarlett-johansson.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/GettyImages-1133537447-feed.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/galleries/thecut/2019/07/Weddings-1/10-header.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/12-luann-1.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/12/HL_LG_HERO.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/07/10/10-boia.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/08/08-scarlett-johansson.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Silman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/met-gala-2018-why-did-scarlett-johansson-wear-marchesa.html", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Explains Why She Wore Marchesa to the Met Gala", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Scarlett Johansson Explains Why She Wore Marchesa to the Met Gala", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/met-gala-2018-why-did-scarlett-johansson-wear-marchesa.html", "description": "What kind of message was she trying to send?", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/08/08-scarlett-johansson.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Scarlett Johansson Explains Her Controversial Met Gala Dress", "description": "What kind of message was she trying to send?", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/08/08-scarlett-johansson.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-08T15:33:00.000-04:00", "tag": "scarlett johansson, met gala 2018, met gala, colin jost, marchesa, harvey weinstein, georgina chapman, fashion, style, red carpet, red carpet derby", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Last night at the Met Gala, Scarlett Johansson wore a Marchesa dress on the red carpet.
