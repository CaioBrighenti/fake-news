We believe that her intent is nothing more than to besmirch the good reputations of the auction house and Ms. Lutz. Madonna's allegations will be vigorously challenged and refuted in a court of law in due course.\"\n\n(TMZ) -- 5:35 PM PT -- According to a report, a judge in NYC just ordered the auction site to remove the items.\n\n{\"position1\": {\"artist\": {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 39257, \"name\": \"2Pac\"}, \"catalog_type\": \"artist\", \"description\": \"\", \"id\": 39257, \"name\": \"2Pac\", \"related\": [{\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 282821, \"name\": \"Makaveli\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 28761, \"name\": \"Ice Cube\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 179, \"name\": \"50 Cent\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 41458, \"name\": \"Dr. Dre\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 8708, \"name\": \"Snoop Dogg\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 58654, \"name\": \"The Notorious B.I.G.\"}, {\"bio\": \"\", \"id\": 32205780, \"name\": \"Thug Life \\u0026 2Pac\"}], \"tagged\": false, \"type\": \"catalog\"}}\n\nMadonna isn't gonna sit back and watch her jailhouse letter from Tupac get sold in an auction ... because she says it was jacked from her home.\n\nMadge filed an emergency court order Tuesday in NYC to block the website gottahaverockandroll.com from hawking the letter and a ton of other personal memorabilia -- including personally worn panties.\n\nIn docs, obtained by TMZ, Madonna says she was blindsided by the auction, and says she never knew some of these items were no longer in her possession. Madonna believes a former friend and art consultant, Darlene Lutz, betrayed her by taking the loot.\n\nTMZ broke the story ... Pac wrote an extremely revealing letter from prison explaining why he had to end his relationship with Madonna -- because she was white and continuing the relationship would hurt his image.\n\nPhoto: AOL", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270798540384083&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8wNi81OTVlOGQ0MzllNDUxMDE2ZWE5MDA2NjUvNTk1ZThkNDIwYzJhZmY3Y2U3YjYxMmJmX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/icon_assets/YAC_Icon.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5b57722689c0b5457926f037?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(96,60)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5b57722689c0b5457926f037?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(158,100),quality(90)"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8wNi81OTVlOGQ0MzllNDUxMDE2ZWE5MDA2NjUvNTk1ZThkNDIwYzJhZmY3Y2U3YjYxMmJmX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-07-19-madonna-files-emergency-order-to-stop-tupac-shakur-letter-auction/", "title": "Madonna Files Emergency Order To Stop Tupac Shakur Letter Auction", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "According to a report, a judge in NYC just ordered the auction site to remove the items.", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8wNi81OTVlOGQ0MzllNDUxMDE2ZWE5MDA2NjUvNTk1ZThkNDIwYzJhZmY3Y2U3YjYxMmJmX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "keywords": "2Pac (39257),Madonna (35393)", "og": {"title": "Madonna Files Emergency Order To Stop Tupac Shakur Letter Auction | 103.5 KTU", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8wNi81OTVlOGQ0MzllNDUxMDE2ZWE5MDA2NjUvNTk1ZThkNDIwYzJhZmY3Y2U3YjYxMmJmX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "url": "https://ktu.iheart.com/content/2017-07-19-madonna-files-emergency-order-to-stop-tupac-shakur-letter-auction/", "description": "According to a report, a judge in NYC just ordered the auction site to remove the items.", "site_name": "103.5 KTU", "locale": "en_US"}, "fb": {"app_id": 409625425402, "pages": 120727317966271}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ktu.iheart.com/content/2017-07-19-madonna-files-emergency-order-to-stop-tupac-shakur-letter-auction/", "site": "@1035KTU", "creator": "@1035KTU", "description": "According to a report, a judge in NYC just ordered the auction site to remove the items.", "title": "Madonna Files Emergency Order To Stop Tupac Shakur Letter Auction | 103.5 KTU", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8wNi81OTVlOGQ0MzllNDUxMDE2ZWE5MDA2NjUvNTk1ZThkNDIwYzJhZmY3Y2U3YjYxMmJmX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "domain": "ktu.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Madonna Files Emergency Order To Stop Tupac Shakur Letter Auction | 103.5 KTU", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-07-19-madonna-files-emergency-order-to-stop-tupac-shakur-letter-auction/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8wNi81OTVlOGQ0MzllNDUxMDE2ZWE5MDA2NjUvNTk1ZThkNDIwYzJhZmY3Y2U3YjYxMmJmX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "parsely-tags": "2Pac (39257),Madonna (35393)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "103.5 KTU", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8wNi81OTVlOGQ0MzllNDUxMDE2ZWE5MDA2NjUvNTk1ZThkNDIwYzJhZmY3Y2U3YjYxMmJmX29fRl92MC5qcGc=", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-07-19 09:38:00-04:00", "parsely-author": "TMZ", "parsely-section": "trending-urban"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500436800.0, "source": "https://ktu.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
