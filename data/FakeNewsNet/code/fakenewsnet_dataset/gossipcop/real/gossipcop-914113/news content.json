Morasco, 37, who is most famous for winning Survivor: The Amazon in 2003, was found unconscious in her SUV in Washington, Pennsylvania, on January 25, TMZ is reporting. Police received a call from a driver in South Strabane that a driver was passed out behind the wheel at a stop sign.\n\nUpon arrival, cops determined she was under the influence, finding her Chevrolet Trax (with custom license plates reading \u201cAMAZON\u201d) still running. They administered Narcan but she woke up on the way to the hospital. When an officer tried to subdue her, the reality star allegedly bit her on the forearm.\n\nThere were also \u201cseveral syringes in a large Ziploc bag in Morasca\u2019s purse,\u201d TMZ reports. She was arrested for possession of narcotics paraphernalia and DUI and will be charged with assaulting a police officer.\n\nFollowing her win on the 2003 season of Survivor, making her the youngest female winner in the show\u2019s history, Morasca went on to compete on 2004\u2019s Survivor: All Stars, The Amazing Race 19 and Fear Factor. She\u2019s also a model who landed a spread in Playboy in 2003 with fellow Survivor contestant Heidi Strobel. Following her win, she began dating Survivor: Africa winner Ethan John. The couple competed together on The Amazing Race but split in 2013 after 10 years together.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/106576286_jenna-morasca-zoom.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/106576286_jenna-morasca-zoom.jpg?crop=97px%2C0px%2C2170px%2C1140px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/106576286_jenna-morasca-zoom.jpg?crop=97px%2C0px%2C2170px%2C1140px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/survivors-jenna-morasco-arrested-after-allegedly-biting-cop-apparent-overdose/", "title": "Survivor\u2019s Jenna Morasco Arrested After Allegedly Biting Cop, Apparent Overdose", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Survivor winner Jenna Morasca has been arrested.
