The helmer of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films has a lifetime total of approximately $6,502.7 billion, followed by Transformers\u2018 Michael Bay ($6.451 billion), Avatar\u2018s James Cameron ($6.139 billion), and Harry Potter\u2018s David Yates ($5.347 billion).\n\nRELATED: Every Steven Spielberg movie, ranked\n\nThe original Jurassic Park is still Spielberg\u2019s biggest commercial success with $983.8 million (not adjusted for inflation). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (despite the many skeptics it garnered) comes in second with $786.6 million, and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial comes in third with $717 million.\n\nIn the past year alone, Spielberg took a quick detour from post-production on Ready Player One to direct a little Oscar contender you might know as The Post, and there\u2019s plenty more on the director\u2019s docket in the months ahead. With a West Side Story remake and another Indiana Jones in the works, might he leap over another box office hurdle?", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/thefarewell.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/toy-story-4.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/j-lo-cardi-b-lizzo.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/otherhood.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C3000px%2C1577px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/x-men-bts-7-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C129px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/df-15250_rv2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rabid.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/m_07748_c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/df-28400_rv2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mulan-a.jpg?crop=540px%2C262px%2C1549px%2C814px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/thelionking5c2f98925cc7b.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/toystory45cfbcc7aebe4d.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a147acd56f71c458ad74777cefaea83?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1158114520.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-914618346.jpg?crop=0px%2C42px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-flash.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10314651af_huge.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C5184px%2C2721.6px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/july-4th-movies.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/joker-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-914618346.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/still5-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/000245269hr.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gigi-saul-guerrero.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-914618346.jpg?crop=0px%2C42px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/", "title": "Steven Spielberg becomes first director to cross $10 billion at worldwide box office", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Steven Spielberg", "news_keywords": "Steven Spielberg", "description": "Just a typical day for the most commercially successful filmmaker.", "og": {"title": "Steven Spielberg becomes first director to cross $10 billion at worldwide box office", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/", "description": "Just a typical day for the most commercially successful filmmaker", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-914618346.jpg?crop=0px%2C42px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/", "description": "Just a typical day for the most commercially successful filmmaker.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-914618346.jpg?crop=0px%2C42px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/17/steven-spielberg-movies-10-billion-box-office/", "title": "Steven Spielberg becomes first director to cross $10 billion at worldwide box office", "description": "Just a typical day for the most commercially successful filmmaker.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gettyimages-914618346.jpg?crop=0px%2C42px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523937600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
