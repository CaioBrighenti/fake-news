What\u2019s the story with that pregnancy shock? Below The X-Files creator Chris Carter takes our burning questions about the season 11 finale in the wake of speculation about the show\u2019s future and star Gillian Anderson\u2019s declaration that she\u2019s finished playing Dana Scully. WARNING: Spoilers ahead!\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Okay, first: Walter Skinner. Just seeing his limp foot isn\u2019t very conclusive \u2014 at least, in terms of TV rules. So are we to assume he might not really be dead?\n\nCHRIS CARTER: It certainly begs many questions. If you pay close attention to that sequence, did he dive under that car or was he run down? He\u2019s motionless, but a lot could be drawn from that as the Cigarette Smoking Man never checked if he was done.\n\nSpeaking of which: Cigarette Smoking Man. Surely you\u2019ll commit to him being dead at last \u2026 right?\n\n[Chuckles] You know, he rejuvenated somehow to come back last season. Scully\u2019s visions of his showed him with some kind of special power of rejuvenation. You wonder as he was pushed off into that water if he may not be dead. There\u2019s this title we posted instead of The Truth is Out There this time, which is \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d [seemingly referring to a painting of Christ by Leonardo Da Vinci], and that had many edges to that sword. One being William being somewhat Christ-like, his resurrection. Mulder saving the world by killing his father. And the Cigarette Smoking Man \u2014 a savior in his own mind because he was going to start the planet anew.\n\nAnd Monica? C\u2019mon, you have to at least give me Monica.\n\nShe\u2019s obviously got a wound that looks fatal. But once again, no one stopped to take her pulse.\n\nChris! You don\u2019t like creative permanence, do you? All right, so does Skinner ever tell Scully that the Smoking Man is William\u2019s \u201cfather,\u201d or does she just figure that out intuitively, or based on her visions?\n\nYou know, she has intuition as we\u2019ve set up, but he actually tells her in the car, except it\u2019s done where we go into Scully\u2019s head. We see him all but say the Cigarette Smoking Man is William\u2019s father.\n\nCan you talk about making the decision to have Scully pregnant again, creatively speaking?\n\nMulder and Scully, there was a lot of foundation for this building to that moment, when they have that pillow talk in episode 3 about the future and old age and having more children. It was set up early on, you can see now, that this moment was coming.\n\nSo are we to assume that the father of Scully\u2019s new baby is definitely Mulder?\n\nYes. But we also have to remember that Scully has alien DNA so there are questions atop that certainty.\n\nGillian has said she\u2019s done with the show. You\u2019ve said, \u201cNot so fast.\u201d What would the show look like if Fox ordered another season without her?\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know right now. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s up in the air right now with Fox\u2019s sale to Disney, and with Gillian\u2019s announcement \u2014 which I respect \u2014 and with more X-Files stories to be told\u2026right now it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nDo you have any sense of the timing for figuring that out at this point?\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny. The episode airs tonight and it\u2019s the end of a year of my life devoted to this. I\u2019m happy not to think about it for a little bit.\n\nThe finale feels like a potential ending, certainly a relatively happy one for Mulder and Scully. If there\u2019s never another X-Files episode, would you be okay with that?\n\nI know there\u2019s more life in this show, whether it\u2019s \u2014 they\u2019re doing a really interesting X-Files narrative game right now \u2014 while it would never be the same without Gillian, as I was saying I do think there are more stories to be told. If this was the last episode, would I be happy? I don\u2019t know. There are so many questions that this begs now. I\u2019m standing with them on the end of that pier and thinking about the impossibility of it and the impossibility of not knowing what the future holds for them.\n\nA few more random questions: There was also a motif in the background this season, including in this finale: The \u201cHave You Seen This Man?\u201d dream man. I\u2019m curious if that was just for fun or if there was a message behind it?\n\nWe were all interested in that Internet meme and we decided he was going with us this season. He\u2019s a perfect X-Files character. He was on the drum kit in episode 3, and on the billboard as you clearly noticed in the finale. I think he made every episode this season.\n\nHow would you have worked in Doggett if Robert Patrick had returned?\n\nI put him in the plot of My Struggle 3. He, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t available. I had to reconceive that story using the character of Mulder\u2019s half-brother \u2014 who was going to be in the episode anyway \u2014 and he stepped in where Doggett was going to step in.\n\nWhat was Monica\u2019s endgame, ultimately?\n\nIt was to protect Mulder and Scully at all costs, and while she was in the league with the devil she had ulterior motives.\n\nOne of your episodes this season \u2014 episode 7 \u2014 was compared by some to Netflix\u2019s Black Mirror. Do you have an opinion on that show as it occupies a similar space as yours?\n\nWhen I think about coming back to network television with The X-Files after being so long off the air, how much television had changed, considering the first episode of Black Mirror was a man having sex with a pig, we were in a new television realm. It certainly affects the way we think of the show and television generally.\n\nMulder seems a bit pessimistic about modern-day America this season. Do you feel the same way?\n\n[Long pause]. I do. I try to fight my cynicism every day. I think we now live in this mode of such sensationalism. I think it\u2019s driven certainly by this political moment, but I think it\u2019s driven more by this media moment and the Internet. And it\u2019s really hard for me to imagine ever going back.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/4-helen-sloan-hbo-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/xf-s2_210-sc44pt-sh_1684_hires2.jpg?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/xf-s2_209-sc17pt-18-sh_0114_hires2.jpg?crop=512px%2C90px%2C1405px%2C1405px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/netflix-tvs.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8507038badc1c41adb48fd6b51538fbd?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/hulu.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/euphoria-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/xf-s2_210-sc44pt-sh_1684_hires2.jpg?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/21/x-files-finale-chris-carter-interview/", "title": "The X-Files finale: Chris Carter explains that shock ending", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Chris Carter", "news_keywords": "Chris Carter", "description": "Who's really dead?
