Thinking about it, I think I could go back and spend more time and feel safe and comfortable.\u201d\n\nKim , 37, decided to make the difficult return after her horrific ordeal two years ago following a conversation with her husband.\n\nThe 41-year-old rapper was flying to the City of Love in June to support his longtime friend Virgil Abloh , who is Louis Vuitton\u2019s Men\u2019s artistic director.\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to put any pressure on you to go to Paris. I know that was really hard the last time you were in Paris.\n\n\u201cSo I think just for the culture, for Kim K. to show up to the first black designer at [a] Louis Vuitton show who was the best man at my wedding, just the world would just love to see you there.\u201d\n\nWhile Kardashian admitted on Sunday\u2019s, Dec. 2, 2018, episode that being in Paris brought back memories of the robbery, she was \u201cso glad\u201d to have done it.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt was so good. Like, honestly, I\u2019m so glad we went. Like [Kanye] had to be there\u2026\n\n\u201cFor a second, I was like, I was so stressed out over my security, just the movement of everyone. But other than that, it was fine. I didn\u2019t really have a lot of anxiety.\u201d", "images": ["https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/getImgIntranet-6-650x630.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/51454387fa8755ea3f4fc81ebc13fbb1?s=164&d=mm&r=g", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ro-logo-18.png?x12879", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fcclub.jpg?x12879", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/getImgIntranet-6.jpg?x12879", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ro-logo-18-100.png?x12879", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sws2b.jpg?x12879", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=666484143716324&ev=PageView\r\n&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/getImgIntranet-6-650x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://rollingout.com/2018/12/03/kim-kardashian-says-she-would-feel-safe-in-paris-following-her-2016-robbery/", "title": "Kim Kardashian says she would feel \u2018safe\u2019 in Paris following her 2016 robbery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "google-site-verification": "0Yj3tUrHdnc2yWCwimJKlw92aQSuA-NlLsRRxJ8FFOI", "dailymotion-domain-verification": "dmo4qzl4r7iqtl9wm", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian says she would feel \u2018safe\u2019 in Paris following her 2016 robbery", "description": "Kim\u00a0Kardashian\u00a0West\u00a0would \u201cfeel safe and comfortable\u201d having a longer stay in Paris.
