A snap of the two sharing a kiss and walking arm to arm in New York City definitely fueled the relationship speculations. Then came Smith\u2019s appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres show where he confirmed to the daytime host that he is no longer single.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird bringing out an album and not being single, \u2019cause when I brought In the Lonely Hour, I was so lonely,\u201d Smith admitted, \u201cbut now I\u2019m singing songs about another guy, and I\u2019m quite happy, so it\u2019s quite weird.\u201c\n\nFlynn took to Instagram Thursday and shared the first photo of himself and Smith together, both sporting sport blue-and-pink unicorn travel pillows. He captioned the adorable snap \u201cRare sighting in London.\u201d Whether he was referring to the sighting of unicorns or the couple\u2019s sighting, the two simply couldn\u2019t look cuter!", "images": ["https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10-324x400.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_9064810wv.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=3BRhr1Fx9f207i", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logo_transparent_background_small.png", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_9064810wv-696x1044.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2-1-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_8633262js-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/4-1-100x70.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-Lt5C7hC-NKF-K.gif", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/shutterstock_8433602f-100x70.jpg"], "top_img": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_9064810wv.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://omgcheckitout.com/sam-smith-brandon-flynn-make-romance-instagram-official/", "title": "Sam Smith and Brandon Flynn Make Their Romance Instagram Official", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_9064810wv-683x1024.jpg", "secure_url": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/shutterstock_9064810wv-683x1024.jpg", "width": 683, "height": 1024}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sam Smith and Brandon Flynn Make Their Romance Instagram Official", "description": "It ain't official until it's on Instagram apparently.
