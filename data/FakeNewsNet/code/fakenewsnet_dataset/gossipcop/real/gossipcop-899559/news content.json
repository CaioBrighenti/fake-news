Great news for her, but if she doesn\u2019t win next month, it would stretch the show\u2019s dismal Globes record to 0-30.\n\nDespite being one of three shows where the main stars have all won Emmy Awards, the NBC comedy is the biggest TV loser at the Globes. \u201cWill & Grace\u201d amassed 27 nominations and zero wins when it was first on the air from 1998 to 2006. Last year, it added two more nominations, for Best TV Comedy/Musical Series and Best TV Comedy/Musical Actor for Eric McCormack, to bring its record to 0-29.
