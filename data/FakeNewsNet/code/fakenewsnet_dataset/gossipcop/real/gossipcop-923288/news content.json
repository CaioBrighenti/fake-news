When the rapper announced during the iHeartRadio Music Awards earlier this month that her \u201calbum will be coming in April, stay tuned motherf\u2014ker!,\u201d the world very much obliged. On Monday night, Cardi announced that her debut album, Invasion of Privacy, will be out on April 6. She also shared the colorful, 80s-style artwork that would no doubt make her idol Madonna proud.\n\nThe world has been impatiently waiting for Cardi B\u2019s debut album since her breakout 2017 single \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d became a surprise number-one hit last summer. She\u2019s since been part of an album\u2019s worth of collaborations, including \u201cMotorsport\u201d with Migos and Nicki Minaj, and \u201cNo Limit\u201d with G-Eazy and A$AP Rocky. She also got engaged to Migos\u2019s Offset and announced her plans to join Bruno Mars\u2019s \u201c24k Magic\u201d tour.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot at stake for Invasion of Privacy to deliver, with fans, critics, and the charts. Though \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d was indeed world-conquering, Cardi is still a relatively new force on the mainstream-music scene. With the anticipation of her full-length album growing with every appearance, award show, and single drop since the summer, the expectations for the album are high.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aba6a14a5d5615ee64a5293/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cardi-B-Album-Drop.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa682c5b15b4b643f1158ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Cardi-B-I-Heart-Radio.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d00d2faef4f5d685d3a408e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Tibi%2520RS18%25200909.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6b6b4b5083c17bb98629e4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Cardi-B-Warner-Bros.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa6b352afb7596b1f19ffcb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/iheartradio-red-carpet-SS03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aba6a14a5d5615ee64a5293/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Cardi-B-Album-Drop.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa6b3524807db55e0503d5e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/iheartradio-red-carpet-SS01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa6b352d81411654dbdb519/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/iheartradio-red-carpet-SS02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6f4a3cd8f404717e649ca4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Neil-Portnow-Grammys.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aba6a14a5d5615ee64a5293/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cardi-B-Album-Drop.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Erika Harwood", "Josh Duboff", "Hilary Weaver", "Erika Harwoo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/cardi-b-album-release-date-cover-art", "title": "Cardi B\u2019s Album Has an Actual Release Date", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "And album art.", "keywords": "invasion of privacy,cardi b,vanities", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "And album art.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aba6a14a5d5615ee64a5293/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cardi-B-Album-Drop.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Cardi B\u2019s Album Has an Actual Release Date", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/cardi-b-album-release-date-cover-art"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "And album art.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aba6a14a5d5615ee64a5293/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Cardi-B-Album-Drop.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Cardi B\u2019s Album Has an Actual Release Date"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
