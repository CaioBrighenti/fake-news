USA TODAY\n\nKurt Russell, 66, and Chris Pratt, 37, star as father and son in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)\n\nCorrection & clarifications: An earlier version of this report misidentified the location of Pinewood Studios. It is south of Atlanta.\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ga. \u2014 Chris Pratt has the most awesome space dad ever.\n\nOn this sunny afternoon at Pinewood Studios just south of Atlanta, Kurt Russell is holding court on the set of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (in theaters Thursday night), telling stories over a campfire. Not tales from Big Trouble in Little China or Escape From New York, though \u2014 Russell is in cosmic character as Ego, a living planet who\u2019s just met his long-lost son, Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord (Pratt).\n\nYes, you read that right: Russell plays an all-powerful living planet and that's not even the craziest aspect of the Guardians\u2019 corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A talking raccoon, a sentient alien tree with a three-word vocabulary (\"I am Groot\") and the rest of this misfit accidental family took the world by storm with the 2014 runaway summer hitGuardians of the Galaxy. The sequel \u2014 which is on track to open with $150 million domestically \u2014 doubles down on the eye-popping new worlds, over-the-top personalities and family drama.\n\nCLOSE Baby Groot steals the show in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' USA TODAY NETWORK\n\n\"Guardians has gone from being an untested, little-known risky Marvel side project with an unusual cast and offbeat sensibility, to a premier brand worthy of its ascension to the coveted opening summer weekend slot,\" says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore.\n\nThe biggest asset at the heart of this sci-fi space opera? A crew of \u201cdamaged souls who are looking for some form of love or redemption and haven\u2019t really ever experienced either of those things,\u201d says returning writer/director James Gunn.\n\nRocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper, left) and Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) are friends till the end. (Photo: Marvel)\n\n\u201cThe reason why so many people love this movie and feel so connected to these characters is because they\u2019re utterly outcasts and oddballs and strange,\" Gunn says. \"They're not the Avengers, they're not the pitch-perfect group of guys who have everything going on. They\u2019re losers often, and even though they have some extraordinary abilities, they\u2019re no better or worse than we are.\u201d\n\nThe Guardians \u2014 the rogueish Star-Lord, assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana), overly literal warrior Drax (Dave Bautista), sarcastic yet damaged Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and adorably precocious Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) \u2014 have already saved the universe, though Peter is still in search of his real father after having been raised from childhood by space outlaw Yondu (Michael Rooker).\n\nThe sequel has them on the run from the conceited aliens known as the Sovereign, and after having saved the heroes from certain doom, Ego is enjoying a meal with his son on the forest planet Berhart, though Peter is curious why Dad never came back for him when his mother died and instead hired Yondu to pick him up.\n\nEgo (Kurt Russell, center) reconnects with his son Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) over a campfire meal while Gamora (Zoe Saldana) looks on with distrust. (Photo: Marvel)\n\n\u201cI would have done so myself, but I was in the midst of an outlandish adventure battling demonic forces to save this dimension or some such nonsense. I don\u2019t even recall. It all bleeds together after a while,\u201d Ego explains. He wonders aloud why Yondu kept Peter instead of returning him, leaving Ego searching for his boy ever since.\n\n\u201cBecause I was a skinny kid who would squeeze into places adults couldn\u2019t and it made thieving easier,\u201d says Quill, clad in a shirt sporting an alien candy logo.\n\nYet there\u2019s as much humor as serious stuff in a Guardians film, and Drax is the first to break the tension. \u201cI thought Yondu was your father,\u201d he says, leading everyone to look at the muscular warrior like he\u2019s nuts.\n\n\u201cWait. After all this time hanging out together, you thought Yondu was my blood relative?\u201d Quill says in exasperation, leading Drax to deadpan, \u201cYou look exactly alike.\u201d\n\nYondu (Michael Rooker, center) is ousted from his role as leader of the Ravagers. (Photo: Marvel)\n\nRocket chimes in \u201cOne\u2019s blue!\u201d \u2014 though Cooper hasn't yet added the furry guy\u2019s vocals. Gunn\u2019s brother Sean (who also returns as Yondu\u2019s Ravager buddy Kraglin) does Rocket\u2019s motion-capture performance and line reading with co-stars.\n\nJames Gunn has put together a close-knit clan of friends and actual family on his Guardians films, and it\u2019s reflected in the sequel\u2019s story of \"fathers, sons, stepfathers, sons who have never seen their father, fathers who have lost their son,\u201d Russell says. \u201cAnd when they finally get back together, everybody\u2019s got to get used to each other. They\u2019re not quite the way you had made them out to be in your imagination.\u201d\n\nAdds Gunn: \u201cIt\u2019s a father/son story that could take place if your father\u2019s a living planet in another galaxy or if your father\u2019s a Wall Street broker.\"\n\nDirector James Gunn (left) goes over a scene with Zoe Saldana and Chris Pratt on the Atlanta set of 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Marvel)\n\nPratt is effusive with praise for his legendary co-star Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream. I\u2019ve been a huge fan of his for ages. There\u2019s nothing disappointing about working with him,\u201d says the actor, who enjoyed Russell\u2019s frequent stories from his heroic roles in such movies as Tombstone and Tango & Cash.\n\nSo how does an icon like Russell play a planet? He leans into the machismo and quirks of those old parts. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of baggage that\u2019s right for this in terms of the kinds of things I can bring as an actor to the table,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd some of the things we created years ago have an element of connection to this character.\u201d\n\nGamora is skeptical of Ego\u2019s extreme interest in Peter, though she's also dealing with her adoptive sister and frenemy Nebula (Karen Gillan), a villain from the first film whom the Guardians have taken captive. Nebula is looking extremely irked while handcuffed as everybody else is gobbling Ego\u2019s blue space chow. (It\u2019s not very good, Russell reports. \u201cIt\u2019s prop Jell-O. We never ask questions, we just eat it.\u201d)\n\nNebula (Karen Gillan) returns with a bone to pick with her sister in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Chuck Zlotnick)\n\nBut everybody needs and seeks a sense of belonging, even Nebula. \u201cShe\u2019s been raised to be a killing machine and not have any empathy or emotion,\u201d Gillan says. \u201cHowever, she has these natural feelings toward her sister that she\u2019s trying to suppress but can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSaldana is just glad to have more women around \u2014 not just Gillan but also new cast member Pom Klementieff, who plays the Guardians\u2019 insect-like telepathic ally Mantis. \u201cThe older I get, the more I realize that it\u2019s pretty lonely being the only female in the cast,\u201d Saldana says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be surrounded by a whole bunch of dudes talking about their (manhood) and bodybuilding and eating healthy.\u201d\n\nShe loves her dudes, though, and there\u2019s a connection between the stars of that original Guardians. Saldana is proud of how Pratt lost weight and got fit for the first movie while \u201cstill remaining this super-humble and sweet and charming individual,\u201d and she\u2019s continually wowed by Bautista\u2019s gentleness and subtlety.\n\nDrax (Dave Bautista, left) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) launch into a new mission to save the universe in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Marvel)\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019s funny,\u201d Saldana says. \u201cI hope that day doesn\u2019t come where Dave goes, \u2018You know what, you\u2019re (messing) up my take here.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore than anyone, the success of the original Guardians has been career-making for Bautista, a former pro wrestler who parlayed Drax into a high-profile role as the villainous Mr. Hinx in the 2015 James Bond movie Spectre.\n\nHis Marvel character looks like \u201ca powerhouse who\u2019ll rip your head off and then he says something completely ridiculous,\u201d says Bautista, though as emotionally scarred as he is, \u201cthere's definitely a sense of innocence about him.\u201d Drax also has a body full of tattoos, and Bautista had a sauna outside of his trailer to soak off all the makeup and prosthetics daily. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019m like a diva with a sauna. But no.\u201d\n\nDrax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) enjoy a laugh in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.' (Photo: Marvel)\n\nDrax meets his quirky match in Klementieff\u2019s Mantis, and the French actress is impressed that Gunn is so good at casting. \u201cEverybody he chose has a big heart and I think it shows on screen.\u201d\n\nThe director wears his fandom on his sleeve, with pop-culture references aplenty and scads of Easter eggs and cameos born from a lifetime of reading comic books. \"Anybody can delve into comic history and pull out obscure characters,\u201d says Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige. \u201cNot everybody can turn them into emotionally resonant and relatable characters that audiences can fall in love with.\u201d\n\nGunn says the emotion he feels for his family and friends is \u201ca bigger inspiration than even the comic-book characters.\u201d He dedicated the movie to his parents in the audience at Vol. 2\u2019s Hollywood premiere, and Gunn looks out for those closest to him.\n\nSean Gunn plays Kraglin the Ravager in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' and also provides the motion-capture performance for Rocket Raccoon. (Photo: Chuck Zlotnick)\n\nThe filmmaker went to bat for his close friend Rooker when it came to casting Yondu. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was Marvel\u2019s first choice. I\u2019m sure there are many other stars and actors that would have brought in more money,\u201d Rooker says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in the room when he was convincing them, but I would bet you my right arm that he had my back in a big way.\u201d\n\nAnd Sean Gunn embraces his status as \u201cthe utility infielder of the Guardians cast\u201d with pride. Watching his older brother\u2019s rise has been \u201cprobably more fun and gratifying for me than just about anyone. I feel like I\u2019ve had a front-row seat to his success.\u201d\n\nTaserface (Chris Sullivan, right) and the Ravagers take Rocket and Groot prisoner in the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' sequel. (Photo: Marvel)\n\nJames Gunn has already started writing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to complete his trilogy, discussing the story with Pratt and having \u201csome pretty intense conversations\u201d with Saldana about a significant role in the threequel. The only travels Gunn has on his docket in the near future, though, are relaxing ones to \u201cget my head on straight after three years of waking up and going to sleep and thinking about a talking raccoon.\u201d\n\nIn the Marvel galaxy, there\u2019s room for more than one awesome space dad.\n\n\u201cI love these characters,\u201d Gunn says. \u201cIncluding my father and my dog, my mother had eight kids, and I have all these Guardians. They\u2019re my kids.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2pnJz4G", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38ba418b3a94b08b199815ab64361abd002a9e3f/c=363-0-3106-3657/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291106295849038-COVER-ART-GUARDIANS-OF-THE-GALAXY-VOL.-2-COVER151-90458956.JPG?width=534&height=712&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-nav-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5005.62.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf7cf13831bd0e6b7b436120bb2bde156b3bb4e7/c=0-0-3547-2667/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291107570377208-LUP-05822-R.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2e0acba52ae67db351771a83f49dbf3ac97c522c/c=596-0-3039-1837/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291120479771960-SCA0610-CMP-v059.1006.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5005.62.0/images/indicators/facebook-loading.gif", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c6c6a657947fc34f8e026a45dcf4598ec9f2e0e0/c=226-0-3773-2667/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291120531876294-LUP-14156-R.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fb539d94131647245874b3be7a82db1ad6c9b98/c=267-0-3814-2667/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291120492096039-LUP-01399-R.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/822651f77c3b2269a2c037ec6af00829b46f5828/c=348-0-3140-2099/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291106083219675-TCH1030-CMP-v003.1015.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a9b70691d2bb733beb5ee384cccb5a80d8f2067/c=393-0-3185-2099/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291120489132020-EBB0320-CMP-v074.1029.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf7cf13831bd0e6b7b436120bb2bde156b3bb4e7/c=0-0-3547-2667/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291106087431702-LUP-19927-R.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/955720ad17b8834d2daf5c8e361cdf7aa4fe2679/c=0-383-3459-2337/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291106295849038-COVER-ART-GUARDIANS-OF-THE-GALAXY-VOL.-2-COVER151-90458956.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-masthead-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0929ce5999396bdb7f881b74731ecc4982817b5c/c=528-0-3320-2099/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291120498648081-ECM0400-CMP-v096.1032.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2580c81a6c754545f536fa1a8098ace6639b2c64/c=577-0-3381-2108/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291106081971667-IRL0140-CMP-v506.1280.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/955720ad17b8834d2daf5c8e361cdf7aa4fe2679/c=0-383-3459-2337/local/-/media/2017/04/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636291106295849038-COVER-ART-GUARDIANS-OF-THE-GALAXY-VOL.-2-COVER151-90458956.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published P.M.
