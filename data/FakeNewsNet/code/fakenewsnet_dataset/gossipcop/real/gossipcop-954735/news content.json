It was a beautiful moment and we so appreciate our friends and family for sharing this day with us,\u201d the couple says in a statement. \u201cMost of all we are thankful to Christ for bringing us together. This is going to be an amazing journey!\u201d\n\nFor her walk down the aisle, the bride wore a design from Renee Miller with Renee\u2019s Bridal.\n\nIn their wedding portrait, Duggar wraps his arm around Burnett as the new husband and wife beam with joy on their big day, which Us Weekly was first to report on Saturday.\n\nImage zoom TLC/Lori Blythe photography\n\nThe couple began courting in June and announced the happy news in a TLC video.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known of each other for several years, but we didn\u2019t meet \u2019til \u2026 \u201d Duggar said as Burnett, who works as a nurse, chimed in, \u201cJohn flew in for a church event here in Oklahoma where I\u2019m from.

And it\u2019s been a wonderful journey thus far and taking the next step to move onto a courtship.\u201d\n\nJust a month later, the pair got engaged after John David got down on one knee in an airplane hangar in front of a sign that read \u201cAbbie, Will You Marry Me?\u201d\n\nImage zoom TLC\n\n\u201cWow! We are engaged! This feels even more real than before! It was a special moment to share together,\u201d Duggar and Burnett said in a joint statement on the family website.\n\n\u201cThe proposal and the \u2018YES\u2019 really solidified that we want to spend the rest of our lives together. One of the most amazing things about following Christ is being able to trust Him to direct your path and lead your life,\u201d they continued. \u201cWe are so thankful that He led us to one another.
