The French-Canadian singer will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of Titanic with a performance of the Oscar-winning ballad \"My Heart Will Go On.\"\n\n\"This song means a lot to me, and it has played such a huge role in my career,\u201d Dion said in a statement. \u201cI'm so grateful to the late James Horner, and to Will Jennings, for writing it and creating the opportunity for me to be part of Titanic, an amazing film whose legacy will continue for generations to come. It's a great honor to have the opportunity to perform it on the Billboard Music Awards' international stage, in celebration of the film's 20th anniversary.\"\n\n\n\nBoth the Titanic soundtrack and its most famous single hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot 100, respectively, in 1998. \"My Heart Will Go On\" also won Grammys for song of the year and record of the year in 1999.\n\nAlong with Dion, another pop legend will be performing an iconic '90s smash at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards.
