An Emmy and Peabody-winning journalist and the author of six books, Maria Shriver is also the niece of John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, and the wife of actor/politician Arnold Schwarzenegger. Most recently, she presented \"The Shriver Report\", which through comprehensive study, detailed the changing role of women in the workforce and its impact on American society.\n\nBorn November 6, 1955 in Chicago, Illinois, Shiver is perhaps best known to be the niece of the late John F. & Robert F. Kennedy. She is a former NBC news correspondent and former wife of actor (and former Governor of California) Arnold Schwarzenegger. She is the daughter of prominent political politician and diplomat Sargent Shriver and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, sister of the late John F. and Robert F. Kennedy. In 1983, Maria began reporting for CBS News and soon won a spot as co-anchor of the CBS Morning News. In 1986, she joined NBC as a correspondent for the news show '1986' and also as anchor for Main Street, a news magazine aimed at young people. 1987-1990, she served as co-anchor on NBC's Sunday Today and in 1990 she began a stint hosting a news special series entitled First Person with Maria Shriver. During Arnold Schwarzenegger's reign as Governor of California, Shriver's duties as First Lady of California felt like a conflict of interest to her, in relation to her role as a journalist, and she quit her NBC job. Her marriage to Schwarzenegger, after more than 20 years together, was ended by Shriver when it was discovered that Schwarzenegger had fathered a child with the couple's housekeeper, Mildred Patricia Baena. Shriver and Schwarzenegger have four children together: Katherine, Christina, Patrick and Christopher.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-504136806-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Gary-Hart.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/CelebrityNetworth2015/images/badges/by_category/democrats/top_80x.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Chris-Pratt-e1561849689319.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-300x300/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Maria-Shriver.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-167802829.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/GettyImages-580959818.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Patrick-Schwarzenegger-e1541277682855.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Nancy-Pelosi.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1093667182.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-462918148.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-91915120.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Katherine-Schwarzenegger.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jacqueline-Kennedy-Onassis.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Joe-Biden.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Rahm-Emanuel.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1160570133.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-511915384.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/al.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Maria-Shriver.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Elizabeth-Warren.jpg"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Maria-Shriver.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-politicians/democrats/maria-shriver-net-worth/", "title": "Maria Shriver Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Maria Shriver net worth:  Maria Shriver is an American journalist, author and former First Lady of California who has a net worth of", "cnw_share_fb_count": 61, "cnw_share_tw_count": 38, "fb": {"app_id": 241750049176605, "admins": 194602255, "pages": 135556409817901}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Maria Shriver Net Worth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-politicians/democrats/maria-shriver-net-worth/", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Maria-Shriver.jpg", "site_name": "Celebrity Net Worth", "description": "Maria Shriver net worth:  Maria Shriver is an American journalist, author and former First Lady of California who has a net worth of"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CelebrityNetWorth", "modified_time": "2015-08-24T12:44:07+00:00", "published_time": "2010-02-23T15:20:26+00:00", "section": "Democrats", "tag": "richest democrats"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@celebnetworth", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Maria-Shriver.jpg", "title": "Maria Shriver Net Worth", "description": "Maria Shriver net worth:  Maria Shriver is an American journalist, author and former First Lady of California who has a net worth of"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1266938426.0, "source": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com", "summary": ""}
