We\u2019ve earned it,\u201d the 52-year-old former countess said in a clip from part 2 of the reunion, which airs Wednesday.\n\nHer comment came after Cohen asked Luann to tell the audience the things about Tom that she loves \u2014 \u201cthat maybe people don\u2019t get from seeing the show.\u201d\n\nIt was a good question, as the 50-year-old hasn\u2019t been seen in the best light during his time on the series \u2014 between being caught by a friend of costar Bethenny Frankel\u2019s kissing a mysterious blonde at The Regency Hotel the day before his engagement party to his numerous \u201chot mic\u201d moments while flirting with his ex girlfriends (including a scene in which he referred to his married self as a \u201cdog with a collar\u201d).\n\nImage zoom Luann and Tom D'Agostino Chance Yeh/FilmMagic\n\nLuann was happy to oblige Cohen\u2019s request. \u201cHe\u2019s not a TV person so he might come off a little awkward because he\u2019s probably nervous as most people would be in that situation. Especially with what happened,\u201d Luann said. \u201cTom is actually a great guy who loves me. And together we just love being together and married.\u201d\n\nBut her praises were not blindly supported, especially when Luann explained that they like to travel, ski and play tennis together.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all lifestyle stuff,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cI always say you can make a lifestyle out of a life but you can\u2019t make a life out a lifestyle.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Take a Look at Some of the Highlights of Luann de Lesseps & Tom D\u2019Agostino Jr.\u2019s Wedding\n\nOn Aug. 3, Luann announced on Twitter that she and Tom were divorcing after only seven months of marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nDays later, she denied allegations that Tom had been unfaithful.\n\n\u201cI do not think Tom cheated on me, definitely not,\u201d Luann told Page Six on Aug. 3 when asked the reasons for their divorce. \u201cGod knows he\u2019s got himself in some trouble in the past, but I don\u2019t believe that continued [while we were married].\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt was impossible, we were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things, and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work. It was a tough decision and we are both very sad about it. But the truth is we just weren\u2019t getting along.\u201d\n\nPart 2 of The Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "images":
