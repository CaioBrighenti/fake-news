{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid%27s_Tale_(TV_series)", "text": "American television series\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale is an American dystopian drama web television series created by Bruce Miller, based on the 1985 novel of the same name by Margaret Atwood. It was ordered by the streaming service Hulu as a straight-to-series order of 10 episodes, for which production began in late 2016. The plot features a dystopian future following a Second American Civil War wherein a totalitarian society subjects fertile women, called \"Handmaids\", into child-bearing servitude.[3]\n\nThe first three episodes of the series premiered on April 26, 2017; the subsequent seven episodes were released every Wednesday. In May 2017, the series was renewed for a second season which premiered on April 25, 2018.[4] In May 2018, Hulu renewed the series for a third season,[5] which premiered on June 5, 2019.[6]\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale has received critical acclaim and its first season won eight Primetime Emmy Awards from thirteen nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series. It is the first show produced by Hulu to win a major award as well as the first series on a streaming service to win an Emmy for Outstanding Series.[7] It also became the first streaming series to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama. Elisabeth Moss was also awarded the Golden Globe for Best Actress.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nIn the near future, fertility rates collapse as a result of sexually transmitted diseases and environmental pollution.[8] With this chaos, the totalitarian, theonomic government of Gilead establishes rule in the former United States in the aftermath of a civil war.[9][10][11] Society is organized by power-hungry leaders along with a new, militarized, hierarchical regime of fanaticism and newly-created social classes, in which women are brutally subjugated, and by law are allowed to work only in very limited roles \u2013 and not allowed to own property, handle money, or read.[11]\n\nWorldwide infertility has led to the conscription of the few remaining fertile women in Gilead, citing an extremist interpretation of the Biblical account of Bilhah. These women, called Handmaids,[11] are assigned to the homes of the ruling elite, where they must submit to ritualized rape by their male masters in order to become pregnant and bear children for those men and their wives. They assume a name created by the addition of the prefix Of- to the first name of the man who owns them. When they are transferred, their names are changed.\n\nAlong with the Handmaids, much of society is now grouped into classes that dictate their freedoms and duties. Women are divided into a small range of social categories, each one signified by a plain dress in a specific color: Handmaids wear long red dresses, heavy boots and white coifs, with a larger white coif to be worn outside, concealing them from public view and restricting their own vision. Marthas (who are housekeepers and cooks, named after the biblical figure) wear long, loose-fitting dull green garments and cover their hair with headwraps. Upperclass Wives (who are expected to run their households beautifully) wear elegant, tailored dresses in blue and turquoise, cut in styles evoking the 1950s. They wear high heels, their hair is carefully coiffed, and they wear gloves and hats when out of doors.[12]\n\nEconowives, the lower-class women who still have minimal agency, are a sort of mixture of all these categories, and they wear shades of gray (a departure from the book in which Econowives wear clothing striped with the aforementioned colors). Women prisoners are called Unwomen and, wearing rags, are worked to death clearing toxic waste in the Colonies.\n\nAnother class of women, Aunts (who train, oversee and discipline the Handmaids), wear brown. Jezebels are sex workers in secret brothels catering to the elite ruling class. They wear otherwise forbidden evening clothes, costumes and lingerie from \u201cbefore\u201d.\n\nAmong the men of Gilead, the Eyes are a secret police watching over the general populace for signs of rebellion, Hunters track down people attempting to flee the country.\n\nJune Osborne, renamed Offred (Elisabeth Moss), is the Handmaid assigned to the home of the Gileadan Commander Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) and his wife Serena Joy (Yvonne Strahovski). Offred is subject to strict rules and constant scrutiny; an improper word or deed on her part can lead to brutal punishment, including death.\n\nOffred, who is named after her male master, Fred (\"Of Fred\"), like all Handmaids, was married and had a daughter, a job, a bank account, and her own name and identity in the \"time before,\" but all she can safely do now is follow the rules of Gilead in hopes that she can someday live free again and be reunited with her husband and daughter. The Waterfords, key players in the rise of Gilead, have their own conflicts with the realities of the society they have helped create.\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nElisabeth Moss as June Osborne / Offred / Ofjoseph #2, a woman who was captured while attempting to escape to Canada with her husband, Luke, and daughter, Hannah.

Although June is initially wary of her, it is revealed she is not as pious as she seems, and the two become friends. Emily has a wife and son living in Canada, and was a university lecturer in cellular biology. Being homosexual is punishable by death in Gilead, and while most intellectuals and \"gender traitors\" are worked to their deaths in the Colonies, Emily, as \"Ofglen\", was spared and later converted into a Handmaid, due to her having \"two viable ovaries\". She was later captured and cruelly punished for her lesbian relationship with a Martha, and is sent to another household where she becomes \"Ofsteven\". She is involved with a resistance movement called \"Mayday\". She was in the process of being worked to death in the toxic fields of the Colonies until the attack on the Red Center had her, Janine, and several others returned to handmaiden duty. After attacking Aunt Lydia at the Lawrence household, she as \"Ofjoseph\" fears execution, until Commander Lawrence sends her away in a truck with the baby Nichole, whom June hands to her before ditching them to free her other daughter Hannah. Both Emily and Nichole manage to flee to Canada, where she is soon reunited with her wife and son.\n\nMadeline Brewer as Janine / Ofwarren / Ofdaniel / Ofhoward, a Handmaid who entered the Red Center for training at the same time as June, and considers June a friend due to her kind treatment.

She was temporarily assigned to the Colonies until a bombing at the new Rachel and Leah Center.\n\nAnn Dowd as Aunt Lydia / Lydia Clements, a woman in charge of overseeing the Handmaids in their sexual reeducation and duties.

She appears to have a soft spot for Janine, and even goes so far as to address her by her given name on occasion.\n\nO. T. Fagbenle as Lucas \"Luke\" Bankole, June's husband from before Gilead. Because he is divorced (he and June began their relationship before his divorce from his first wife), their union is considered invalid in the new society.

Initially, June believes he has been killed, but it is later revealed Luke managed to escape to Canada.\n\nMax Minghella as Commander Nick Blaine, Commander Waterford's driver and a former drifter from Michigan who has feelings for June.

She initially follows the rules and does not wish to upset the status quo, but this is because she believes her life as a Handmaid is better than the difficult, impoverished life she led prior to Gilead, rather than out of religious piety. After refusing to stone Janine, she was clubbed with a rifle by a guardian, and her tongue was cut out according to Alma. After that, she sacrifices herself to bomb a new Red Center on the day of its christening. 26 Commanders and 31 Handmaids were killed as a result.\n\nNina Kiri as Alma / Ofrobert, another Handmaid who trained at the Red Center with June, Moira, and Janine.
