She also got creative with her footwear, enlisting a pal to bedazzle a pair of white Converse sneakers rather than donning heels.\n\n\u201cI have the best roomie everrr!\u201d Nilsson captioned a photo of the one-of-a-kind accessory. \u201cLook at the shoes she made for me to wear today!!! @juliasobo you are a wizard!!! I mean, come on!!!! I love you!\u201d\n\nNilsson also shared a photo of a double rainbow in the sky as she made her way to the venue.\n\nAttendees were treated to an outdoor dinner at the reception, where white tables were adorned with candles and green plants. The bar also had \u201cBritt + Jeremy\u201d across the front.\n\nThe bride and groom kissed as guests held up sparklers and also had some fun with the garter, with Byrne sticking his head under Nilsson\u2019s dress as she laughed.\n\nNilsson, 30, revealed her engagement to her boyfriend of almost two years in May.\n\n\u201cReally big news!!\u201d she first captioned a photo of herself and Byrne sitting on a couch in front of a candlelit and white rose-adorned table.\n\n\u201cWE ARE ENGAGED!!!!\u201d Nilsson shared in a second Instagram post. \u201cI\u2019m over the moon!!! The man of my dreams and the most godly, amazing, fun, life-giving, silly, intelligent, wonderful best friend I could ever ask for is my future husband!!!! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\ude46\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf37\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f I have been dreaming of this day forever!!

I love you forever Jeremy Byrne!!! \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 were getting married!!!!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Chris Harrison: What The Bachelorette Would\u2019ve Been like If Britt Won\n\nNilsson and Byrne first dated four or five years ago when they were set up, and got together again a year and eight months ago.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy, but I knew he was the one before we even met. I prayed about it and I just knew, before we even met face to face!\u201d Nilsson said about Byrne, who proposed with his great-grandmother\u2019s ring. (\u201c[Jeremy] also designed one that is still being made and will be ready in about two weeks,\u201d Nilsson added.)\n\nLeading up to the wedding, Nilsson teased the kind of nuptials she was planning on having.\n\n\u201cI think we will have an intimate-feeling wedding (not too formal, definitely outdoors) but still try to invite as many loved ones as we can to celebrate! We want it to feel like a party, and a party that feels like us \u2026 so it will probably be under trees with Christmas lights with games and dancing and candles! And not a fancy chicken dinner you pick before hand, something more fun! Maybe some cool food trucks? And the dress \u2014I\u2019m not sure yet! Simple and sweet!\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/john-schneider-5.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/social-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/britt-nilsson2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C738px%2C387.45px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/josh-gracin-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2160px%2C1134px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kathryn-hahn.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/sophie-turner-4.jpg?crop=0px%2C734px%2C1120px%2C588px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lowe-12.jpg?crop=0px%2C34px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ed-sheeran1.jpg?crop=0px%2C287px%2C1822px%2C957px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/beth-chapman-dog-bounty-hunter-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/olivia-jade.jpg?crop=0px%2C94px%2C1334px%2C701px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/67258903_2392955247640441_2845918697389161182_n.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/britt-nilsson2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gretchen-rossi-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C997px%2C523.425px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mehgan-split.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/katharine-mcphee.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/62473238_446227572878708_8381411401523178251_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2400px%2C1260px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/shfeu.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/file-9.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tout-4-2.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/116ab788de5f8b786cd3e7aa9ed6e0c3?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://people.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/abram-boise-2.jpg?crop=146px%2C20px%2C606px%2C318px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/social-11.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/britt-nilsson2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C738px%2C387.45px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/britt-nilsson-marries-jeremy-byrne/", "title": "Who Needs a Final Rose?
