I never wanted it to be over. I love those characters,\" she said.\n\nHatcher believes former co-stars Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman and Marcia Cross would join her for a reunion, but said the chances of it happening are slim.\n\n\"I don't think [the odds are] very good. Just because of the creators,\" she explained. \"It's not the women. I think the women would probably all do it.\"\n\nDesperate Housewives had an eight-season run from 2004 to 2012. Hatcher said the cast hasn't kept in contact since the show came to an end, although the women reportedly wish each other well.\n\n\"Not so much,\" she said. \"But definitely supportive of everything that we're all off and doing. Very exciting Eva's about to have her first baby!\"\n\nLongoria, who is expecting her first child with husband Jose Bast\u00f3n, had expressed interest in a revival in an interview with NewBeauty in December. The actress portrayed Gabrielle Solis on Desperate Housewives.\n\n\"I wish!\" she said. \"I love that show. I miss it every single day. I miss being Gaby. I miss being on that set. But our creator [Marc Cherry] has said many times he wouldn't bring it back. Plus, we're all so busy.\"\n\nBy Annie Martin\n\nOriginally published in UPI Entertainment News.", "images": ["https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GettyImages-2355222-1014x570.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner4.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/946102885/?value=1.00&currency_code=USD&label=fOb8CPqJwGYQ5cSRwwM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/logo-tvinsider.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Untitled-design-2019-03-12T131001.820-304x195.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner3.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-sRxQ0qKU4hQu4.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=19587797&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/OnDISH_Mini-Logo.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner6.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo-white.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo-footer.png", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/activity/src=9413168;type=invmedia;cat=retar0;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;npa=;ord=1;num=1", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner1-38x32.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner2.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-08-at-5.53.38-PM.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-08-at-5.53.38-PM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvinsider.com/672179/teri-hatcher-wants-desperate-housewives-revival/", "title": "A 'Desperate Housewives' Revival?
