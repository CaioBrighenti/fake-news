The actress announced she was diagnosed with breast cancer in September, a few days after she won her sixth consecutive Emmy for her portrayal of Selina Meyer in Veep. HBO subsequently halted production on the comedy series while Louis-Dreyfus received treatment; the show will resume filming in August, and the new episodes will air in 2019.\n\nLater in the program, Veep won the award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Actor Tony Hale sang Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 praises in the press room backstage, saying, \u201cWhoever\u2019s No. 1 on the call sheet sets the tone, and she has set the tone that we\u2019re all part of the team. No one is walking around on egg shells. We can all throw in jokes. It really creates this environment that\u2019s a family. And she\u2019s a really good cook. She makes a really good key lime pie. We miss her greatly. We wish she were here, big time.\u201d\n\nAfter Veep\u2018s win, the actress tweeted, \u201cI wish I could have been @SAGawards tonight but have to admit it\u2019s pretty fun to watch in my pj\u2019s. So honored to win. So proud to be a union member. So happy for my @VeepHBO bozos for winning ensemble award. Miss being at the table with you all. How was the chicken?\u201d\n\nI wish I could have been @SAGawards tonight but have to admit it's pretty fun to watch in my pj's. So honored to win. So proud to be a union member. So happy for my @VeepHBO bozos for winning ensemble award. Miss being at the table with you all. How was the chicken? \u2014 Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) January 22, 2018\n\nLouis-Dreyfus\u2019 SAG Award Sunday night is her third overall win for the part. She previously won the award twice for her role as Elaine Benes on Seinfeld. Additionally, she has won three comedy ensemble awards for Seinfeld.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus beat out Alison Brie (GLOW), Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin (Grace and Frankie), and Uzo Aduba (Orange Is the New Black) for the award.\n\nWith reporting by Maureen Lee Lenker.", "images":
