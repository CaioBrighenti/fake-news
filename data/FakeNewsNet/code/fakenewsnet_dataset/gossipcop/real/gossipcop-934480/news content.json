We have learned that Kris Jenner is glad almost all of her daughters are now moms and here\u2019s why!\n\nKris alongside Kim Kardashian were guests on Live With Kelly and Ryan on Mother\u2019s Day and the momager opened up about the nights her children would make her worry so much she couldn\u2019t fall asleep.\n\nSo who was the one who kept her up at night the most?\n\n\u2018Khloe for sure. Khloe would sneak out at night when she was just a teenager, and I do not think she could even drive yet,\u2019 the Jenner recalled.\n\nKim went on to mention that Khloe was about 14 years old at the time.\n\n\u2018She would stuff the bed so that if we peeked into the room, it looked like her,\u2019 Kris said, adding that she would sneak out the window.\n\n\u2018I would hear her music blasting. Go knock on the door\u2014it would be locked,\u2019 Kim remembers.\n\n\u2018She was with her gaggle of friends,\u2019 Kris chimed in.\n\nBut of course, she couldn\u2019t get away with it forever!\n\n\u2018We finally caught her. That thing never moved, and it always looked the same. I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m on to you Khloe,\u2019\u2019 the momager said.\n\nThat is when host Kelly Ripa told her: \u2018I hope your children are just like you,\u2019 and Kris was quick to confirm, \u2018Of course! I did that to all of them. Payback is a bitch!\u2019\n\nAs fans of KUWK know already, all of Kris Jenner\u2019s kids, except for Kendall Jenner have at least one child of their own.\n\nKris also made it very clear that she adores being their grandmother but apparently, they don\u2019t call her that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Mason [Disick] called me Grandma but then when Kourtney got pregnant again, I thought, \u2018What if I have more than one person running around shouting Grandma,\u2019 so I decided let\u2019s think of a name. They call me Lovey.\u2019", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NickMarkus-1-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toni-Braxton-300x169.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scott-kourtney-sofia-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pauley-Perrette-Mark-Harmon-NCIS-300x195.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kim-kardashian-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kris-jenner.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Kandi-Burruss-300x233.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Britney-Spears-Packs-On-The-PDA-On-A-Hot-And-Steamy-Lunch-Date-With-Sam-Asghari-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/00-social-jaden-jordyn-lv-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NeNe-Leakes-Cancer-Stricken-Husband-Gregg-Completes-6-Months-of-Chemotherapy-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-Donald-Trump-Nancy-Pelosi-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/miranda-cosgrove-300x203.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kris-jenner.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Markus", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/kuwk-kris-jenner-glad-her-problematic-daughters-have-kids-of-their-own-now-paybacks-a-bih-145771/", "title": "KUWK: Kris Jenner Glad Her Problematic Daughters Have Kids Of Their Own Now \u2013 \u2018Payback\u2019s A Bi**h\u2019", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Nick Markus", "news_keywords": "kris jenner, kuwk, the kardashians,", "keywords": "celebrity news, kris jenner, kuwk, the kardashians,", "description": "It\u2019s finally time for the famous momager to have her revenge!
