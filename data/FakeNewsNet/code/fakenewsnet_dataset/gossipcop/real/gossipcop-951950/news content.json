(AP)\n\nThe Wimbledon final on Saturday was a bout between two women fighting to get back to the top of tennis, and Angelique Kerber came away with a comfortable win, beating Serena Williams, 6-3, 6-3.\n\n\"To share with her a court, it's always an honor for me because I know she's pushing me to the limits I have to play my best tennis,\" Kerber said. \"To win the final against her, it's always even [more special] for me.\"\n\nBetween Kerber's fall from world No. 1 to outside the Top 20, and Williams making one of the most notable comebacks in the history of tennis, there were inspiring redemption stories on both sides of the net. Kerber rises to No. 4 with the victory, while Williams is up from No. 181 to No. 28.\n\nComebacks take many forms, and today I witnessed two remarkable ones. Congrats to @AngeliqueKerber and to @serenawilliams. You are both champions. #Wimbledon \u2014 Billie Jean King (@BillieJeanKing) July 14, 2018\n\nWilliams was emotional after the loss:\n\n\"I was really happy to get this far. For all the moms out there, I was playing for you today\"\n\n\n\nGrace, poise and emotion.

She then followed it up with what was, by her standards, a miserable 2017.\n\n\"I think without 2017 I couldn't win this tournament,\" Kerber said. \"I think I learned a lot from last year, with all the expectation, all the things I go through.\n\n\n\n\"I think that I tried to enjoy every single moment now.\"\n\nHer return to success on the grandest stage not only makes Kerber one of the biggest names on tour, but also inserts her into conversations about generational greats.\n\nMost career Grand Slam titles among active women's players:\n\n\n\nSerena\n\n????????????????????\n\n????????????????????\n\n????????????????????\n\n????????????????????\n\n????????????\n\n\n\nVenus\n\n????????????????????\n\n????????\n\n\n\nSharapova\n\n????????????????????\n\n\n\nKerber\n\n????????????\n\n\n\nAzarenka\n\n????????\n\n\n\nKuznetsova\n\n????????\n\n\n\nKvitova\n\n????????\n\n\n\nMuguruza\n\n???????? \u2014 Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) July 14, 2018\n\nIn 2016, Kerber won 63 matches.\n\nIn 2017 Kerber won 29 matches.\n\nThis is 39 wins in 2018\n\nA French from a Career Slam \u2014 Jon Wertheim (@jon_wertheim) July 14, 2018\n\nAngelique Kerber: Hall of Famer? https://t.co/AA0fst5G2Y \u2014 Victoria Chiesa (@vrcsports) July 14, 2018\n\nMuch of the tennis world reached out to congratulate Kerber, including her Hopman Cup partner Alexander Zverev.\n\nAnd three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker:\n\nAnd 2013 Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki:\n\nAnd fellow German player Andrea Petkovic:\n\nBecause Williams' comeback has been an achievement in itself, two-time champion Petra Kvitova congratulated both players.\n\nJelena Djokovic, wife of 2018 men's finalist Novak, was also in awe of what Williams had done.\n\nThis amazing woman @serenawilliams has given birth to her little girl just one day before I gave birth to my girl 10 months ago.
