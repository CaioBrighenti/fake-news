The Seattle dad planned to build the playhouse his daughters always wanted ... and, boy, did he deliver!\n\nPrompted by his youngest daughter's request for a real-life Diagon Alley (the magical shopping street from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series), Chambers decided it was time to leave his job and indulge in this project for his family and community.\n\n\u201cIt was the perfect storm of timing,\u201d the 46-year-old told TODAY Home. \u201cI wanted to pursue this rather than contribute to someone else\u2019s bottom line.\u201d\n\nChambers started by sketching out plans for the famous shops from the wizarding world. He designed storefronts for Ollivander\u2019s Wand Shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies and Flourish and Blotts Bookshop on one side of his driveway.\n\nDoes this street look familiar? Jonathan Chambers\n\nA game of Quidditch anyone? Jonathan Chambers\n\nOn the other side, he replicated the Magical Menagerie, Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions and Eeylops Owl Emporium.\n\nChambers had illustrators draw animal cages for the Magical Menagerie. Dummaloop / Jonathan Chambers\n\nAs an experienced woodworker, he invested $3,000 of his own money to get the project going and used a 3-D printer to create detailed finishes, including lanterns, Quaffle balls and an impressive Golden Snitch.\n\nChambers created his very own Golden Snitch with a 3-D printer. dummaloop/Instagram\n\nChambers then posted messages on social media seeking help from friends and neighbors to build some of the more labor-intensive parts. He was pleasantly surprised when more than 30 people showed up, half of them children.\n\nChambers' daugther Haley (center) preps and paints one of the Diagon Alley displays with her friends. Jonathan Chambers\n\n\u201cThey brought lumber, scrap wood, exterior paint; it was a community effort,\u201d Chambers said, mentioning that it added up to about $2,000 in supplies. \u201cThe kids were beaming with pride that they had a hand in this thing.\u201d\n\nThe result was a masterpiece \u2014 built in just 17 days! \u2014 and the dad of two said he's been humbled by the positive feedback.\n\n\"The No. 1 comment I\u2019ve gotten from visitors is, 'Thank you for doing this for the community,'\" he said. \"I\u2019ve realized this is something I want to continue doing, I want to make a difference \u2026 and it\u2019s been amazing, bringing people together to work on this.\n\nAn estimated 5,000 muggles of all ages have come to see this Seattle driveway-turned-Diagon Alley since it opened on Halloween. dummaloop/Instagram\n\n\"The biggest reaction has actually been from millennials who grew up with 'Harry Potter' \u2014 they're giddy, they're over the moon with the details,\" he said.\n\nWhen Chambers and his team finished the display in time for Halloween, nearly 3,000 trick-or-treaters descended on his whimsical driveway. They used the huge turnout as an opportunity to raise money for a cause that's close to their hearts, pancreatic cancer research. A close family friend, Matt Bencke, recently died from the disease and Chambers eldest daughter, Haley, has been fundraising since. The project helped them put $4,000 toward that goal.\n\n\"It's been amazing bringing people together like this,\" Chambers said of his Diagon Alley replica. Jonathan Chambers\n\nAnd Chambers is far from finished with Diagon Alley. He\u2019s building two more stand-alone stores: Gringotts Wizarding Bank and the Leaky Cauldron Pub. The additions will be added in December and the entire display will be open to the public through Christmas.\n\nIn the new year, he hopes to add actual playhouses to the existing facades and donate the completed installation to Camp Korey, an organization that offers the camp experience to children with serious medical conditions and special needs.\n\n\u201cMy brother has special needs and to me, this would be perfect fit,\u201d he said.\n\n\"My youngest daughter likes to remind me that it was all her idea to do Diagon Alley,\" Chambers said. Jonathan Chambers\n\nWhat\u2019s next for this superdad? \u201cI want to build a life-size Millennium Falcon,\u201d Chambers said. Judging by his dedication and his tenacious team, we have no doubt that he'll pull it off!", "images": ["https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1295344/diagon-alley-today-171110-tease_72511b27044d100678be117e6127ee78.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1295344/diagon-alley-today-171110-tease_72511b27044d100678be117e6127ee78.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/home/seattle-dad-creates-harry-potter-s-diagon-alley-his-driveway-t118627", "title": "Seattle dad creates \u2018Harry Potter\u2019s\u2019 Diagon Alley in his driveway", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/home/seattle-dad-creates-harry-potter-s-diagon-alley-his-driveway-t118627", "title": "World's best dad builds a life-size replica of \u2018Harry Potter\u2019s\u2019 Diagon Alley", "description": "Seattle dad Jonathan Chambers quit his day job to conjure up an epic playland for his daughters and the community ? right in his driveway.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1295344/diagon-alley-today-171110-tease_72511b27044d100678be117e6127ee78.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1295344/diagon-alley-today-171110-tease_72511b27044d100678be117e6127ee78.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1295344/diagon-alley-today-171110-tease_72511b27044d100678be117e6127ee78.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "World's best dad builds a life-size replica of \u2018Harry Potter\u2019s\u2019 Diagon Alley", "description": "Seattle dad Jonathan Chambers quit his day job to conjure up an epic playland for his daughters and the community ? right in his driveway.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Seattle dad Jonathan Chambers quit his day job to conjure up an epic playland for his daughters and the community ? right in his driveway.", "thumbnail": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_45/1295344/diagon-alley-today-171110-tease_72511b27044d100678be117e6127ee78.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510680240.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
