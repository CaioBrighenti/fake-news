I don\u2019t like letting new people in that easy because I don\u2019t want to lose someone again like that.\n\nJohnson added that he knew that his mother was sick, but he felt like \u201ca lot of people take too many chances of being too open too easily and I don\u2019t really do that.\u201d\n\nStaring contest.
