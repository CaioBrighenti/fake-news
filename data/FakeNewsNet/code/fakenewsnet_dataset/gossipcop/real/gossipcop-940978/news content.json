Nick Viall couldn\u2019t be happier for former Bachelor in Paradise costars Jared Haibon and Ashley Iaconetti, who are finally dating after a flirty three-year friendship.\n\nThe newly minted couple sent Bachelor Nation into a frenzy when they announced their relationship via the TV show The Story of Us on Tuesday, May 22. Jared made Us swoon when he admitted that he finally fell in love with Ashley upon seeing her date Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Kevin Wendt. Nick took to Instagram on Wednesday, May 23, to reflect on witnessing Jared\u2019s heartbreak.\n\n\u201cHaving had Jared move in several months ago, I\u2019ve been blessed to see this relationship unfold. When Ashley found herself in another relationship, it was actually pretty damn adorable to see Jared visibly frustrated,\u201d the former Bachelor recalled of Haibon, who moved to L.A. at the end of last year. \u201cThen getting to watch Jared realize Ashley had been the best thing to ever happen to him and couldn\u2019t risk losing her forever was the most reactive relative tv I have ever seen.\u201d\n\nAlthough Nick is now standing behind the couple, in the past he had doubts they were meant to be. During Bachelor in Paradise season 3, Nick told Ashley that she will \u201cnever be with Jared,\u201d something that truly stuck with her as the Rhode Island native pursued a relationship with Caila Quinn. However, Nick backtracked in his post on Wednesday, admitting he was wrong.\n\n\u201cI remember telling Ashley she will never be with Jared, thankfully I was way off. I never would have thought that only a few years later they would have the type of magic with each other that one day I hope I\u2019m lucky enough to find for myself,\u201d he raved. \u201cI look forward to continuing to be your unofficial third wheel and photographer.\u201d\n\nJared opened up about his relationship with Ashley during Tuesday\u2019s episode of the Help! I Suck at Dating podcast and shut down Dean Unglert\u2019s awkward questions about the couple\u2019s sex life. \u201cObviously that\u2019s been a topic over the last few years for Ashely, so I\u2019m not really talking about that,\u201d he said.\n\nAshley has been vocal about her virginity since first appearing on Chris Soules\u2019 season of The Bachelor in 2015. Before she and Kevin called it quits, Ashley told Us that she is done talking about her V-card and will \u201cnever, ever, say yes or no\u201d to fans\u2019 questions about her sex life.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ashley-iaconetti-nick-viall.jpg?crop=176px%2C10px%2C1523px%2C801px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ashley-iaconetti-nick-viall.jpg?crop=111px%2C12px%2C1676px%2C947px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ashley-iaconetti-nick-viall.jpg?crop=176px%2C10px%2C1523px%2C801px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nick-viall-regrets-telling-ashley-iaconetti-shed-never-date-jared-haibon/", "title": "Nick Viall Regrets Telling Ashley Iaconetti She\u2019d Never Date Jared Haibon", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Nick Viall recalls telling \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 costar Ashley Iaconetti and that Jared Haibon would never go for her \u2014 see more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nick Viall Regrets Telling Ashley I That She\u2019d \u2018Never\u2019 Be With Jared", "description": "Nick Viall recalls telling \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 costar Ashley Iaconetti and that Jared Haibon would never go for her \u2014 see more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nick-viall-regrets-telling-ashley-iaconetti-shed-never-date-jared-haibon/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ashley-iaconetti-nick-viall.jpg?crop=176px%2C10px%2C1523px%2C801px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ashley-iaconetti-nick-viall.jpg?crop=176px%2C10px%2C1523px%2C801px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Ashley Iaconetti Nick Viall"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelor", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-23T21:39:50+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Nick Viall recalls telling \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 costar Ashley Iaconetti and that Jared Haibon would never go for her \u2014 see more", "title": "Nick Viall Regrets Telling Ashley I That She\u2019d \u2018Never\u2019 Be With Jared", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ashley-iaconetti-nick-viall.jpg?crop=176px%2C10px%2C1523px%2C801px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527111590.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
