Simpson \u2014 famously acquitted of murder in her sister Nicole Brown Simpson\u2018s death \u2014 would walk free again.\n\nNow that a Nevada parole board has granted the 70-year-old Simpson an early release, allowing him to leave prison as early as Oct. 1, Brown, 46, says she feels she has no other choice but to accept it, for her own peace of mind.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d she tells PEOPLE. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it.\u201d\n\nOn July 20, four Nevada parole board commissioners voted unanimously for Simpson\u2019s release, citing the support he has from his family and his disciplinary-free record while behind bars. The decision came almost nine years after the disgraced football star was sentenced to a maximum of 33 years in prison for his role in the armed robbery of two sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2007.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done my time,\u201d Simpson said at his parole hearing. \u201cI\u2019ve done it as well and as respectfully as anybody can.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Nevada state law and people have to remember that,\u201d Brown says. \u201cI do what I can to make the choice of accepting what I can\u2019t change or control. If I bring 1994 into this case, I will think, \u2018That\u2019s all we got?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2022 For more on Simpson\u2019s life after prison and why he went free, subscribe now to PEOPLE or pick up this week\u2019s issue, on newsstands Friday.\n\nImage zoom Tanya Brown (left, in 2017) and Nicole Brown Simpson (in an undated photo) Maury Phillips/WireImage; Ron Galella/WireImage\n\n\u2018A Conflict-Free Life? Really?\u2019\n\nWatching Simpson\u2019s parole hearing as it was streamed live online and broadcast on TV brought back mixed feelings for Brown \u2014 especially, she says, when he told the board that he had \u201cbasically lived a conflict-free life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Really? Let me play that 911 tape from Nicole for you,\u2019 \u201d she recalls. \u201cPeople forget that 911 call.\u201d\n\nDuring Simpson\u2019s highly publicized murder trial in the grisly 1994 deaths of Nicole, his ex-wife, and her friend Ron Goldman, details surfaced of his explosive temper as tapes of Nicole\u2019s gut-wrenching 911 calls became public.\n\nThough Simpson denied assaulting Nicole, he pleaded no contest in 1989 to a charge of spousal abuse stemming from an altercation on Jan. 1, 1989, that sent her to the hospital.\n\n\u201cHe beat my sister,\u201d Brown says. \u201cThat has been well documented.\u201d\n\nDuring Simpson\u2019s stint in prison, Brown says she has been quietly living her life, working as a community liaison for a hospice care company and, with a master\u2019s degree in counseling psychology, serving as a life coach and speaker with her own website.\n\nShe has also written two books: Finding Peace Amid the Chaos, in 2014, which details the pain she experienced after her sister\u2019s killing and the sensationalized trial that followed; and, in 2015, The Seven Characters of Abuse.\n\nImage zoom O.J.
