They expand. One love isn\u2019t moved out to make room for someone new. An addition is built.\u201d\n\nMs. Sandberg, who has spoken often of her grief over the unexpected death of her husband, Dave Goldberg, in May 2015, also weighed in with a message of support for Mr. Oswalt and Ms. Salenger and praise for Ms. Roman\u2019s piece.\n\n\u201cI laughed and cried a bit because what you are saying is so true,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \u201cNo one should judge another\u2019s path \u2014 and everyone deserves to find love again.\u201d\n\nMr. Oswalt, a stand-up comedian known for a string of roles on film and television, including the sitcom \u201cThe King of Queens,\u201d has been very public about his struggle with grief after the death of his wife. In an interview with The New York Times last October, Mr. Oswalt said he would \u201cnever be at 100 percent again.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/10/arts/11xp-oswald/11xp-oswald-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/10/arts/11xp-oswald/11xp-oswald-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/10/arts/11xp-oswald/11xp-oswald-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liam Stack"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/arts/patton-oswalt-engagement.html", "title": "Patton Oswalt Announces His Engagement \u2014 and Strikes Back at \u2018Grub Worm\u2019 Critics", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-07-10T20:20:41.000Z", "modified": "2017-07-10T22:47:25.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/liam-stack", "tag": "Social Media"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005246954, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/2b2dbbba-96ff-5319-83e2-1ac8daa24d97", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/f37262ca76f54b7c9ceca5151db7609d", "description": "Mr. Oswalt and his fianc\u00e9e, the actress Meredith Salenger, rebuked critics who said he had moved on too soon from the 2016 death of his first wife.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/10/arts/11xp-oswald/11xp-oswald-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Liam Stack", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/10/arts/11xp-oswald/11xp-oswald-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Patton Oswalt,Meredith Salenger,Weddings and Engagements,Widows Widowers,Social Media", "pdate": 20170710, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/arts/patton-oswalt-engagement.html", "type": "article", "title": "Patton Oswalt Announces His Engagement \u2014 and Strikes Back at \u2018Grub Worm\u2019 Critics", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/10/arts/11xp-oswald/11xp-oswald-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "Mr. Oswalt and his fianc\u00e9e, the actress Meredith Salenger, rebuked critics who said he had moved on too soon from the 2016 death of his first wife."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/arts/patton-oswalt-engagement.html", "title": "Patton Oswalt Announces His Engagement \u2014 and Strikes Back at \u2018Grub Worm\u2019 Critics", "description": "Mr. Oswalt and his fianc\u00e9e, the actress Meredith Salenger, rebuked critics who said he had moved on too soon from the 2016 death of his first wife.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/10/arts/11xp-oswald/11xp-oswald-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Patton Oswalt in 2009.
