In the opening song, \u201cKill Jay-Z,\u201d the musician referenced his reported cheating on Beyonc\u00e9, rapping, \u201cYou almost went Eric Ben\u00e9t / Let the baddest girl in the world get away / I don\u2019t even know what else to say / N\u2014a, never go Eric Ben\u00e9t.\u201d\n\nThe line is notably a nod to when Ben\u00e9t was unfaithful to his then-wife, Halle Berry, in the early 2000s. The two were married in 2001, separated by 2003, and their divorce was finalized in 2005.\n\nBen\u00e9t aptly responded to the name-drop on Twitter Friday morning, writing, \u201cHey yo [Jay-Z]! Just so ya know, I got the baddest girl in the world as my wife\u2026 like right now!\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t was referring to Manuela Testolini, who he\u2019s been married to since 2011.\n\nHey yo #Jayz! Just so ya know, I got the baddest girl in the world as my wife\u2026.like right now! \u270c\ud83c\udffe \u2014 Eric Ben\u00e9t (@ebenet) June 30, 2017\n\nThe intro track comes as a seeming mea culpa after Beyonc\u00e9 dropped her unapologetic anthem \u201cSorry\u201d in 2016 off the record-breaking visual album \u201cLemonade,\u201d suggesting, \u201cHe only want me when I\u2019m not there / He better call Becky with the good hair.\u201d\n\nThe rapper finally settled the infamously immortalized incident: \u201cI\u2019ll f\u2014 up a good thing if you let me / Let me alone Becky! / A man who don\u2019t take care of his family can\u2019t be rich.\u201d\n\nJay-Z\u2019s entire 10-song album dropped exclusively on Tidal in partnership with Sprint on Friday.", "images":
