Many people have sang the song: \"I'ma buy you a drank / (Ooh wee) I'ma take you home with me.\" But the actual lyrics are: \"I'ma buy you a drank (And then) I'ma take you home with me.\"\n\nIn retrospect, this makes a lot more sense. But don\u2019t feel too bad if you\u2019ve been messing up the lyrics for the past decade. T-Pain insists the lyrics are \"whatever you want it to be.\" He\u2019s just grateful that you enjoy the record.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cand then\u201d not \u201cooh wee\u201d but really it\u2019s whatever you want it to be just enjoy the song however you hear it. I just appreciate you listening. #BuyUADrank #THANX \u2014 T-Pain (@TPAIN) November 29, 2017\n\nThe news sparked shock and denial.\n\nShit crazy I really thought T-Pain said \"oooooweee\" in buy u a drank but he was saying \"and then\" I feel like my life is a lie deadass..... or is this The Mandela Effect \ud83e\udd14 \u2014 \ud83c\udf39TayMasterChef (@TayMasterChef) November 30, 2017\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nwhen t-pain said it\u2019s \u201cand theeen\u201d instead of \u201cooh weee\u201d when the buy u a drank chorus hits... pic.twitter.com/CW8bxdpJfy \u2014 Diego Molina (@__DiegoMolina__) November 30, 2017\n\nI don\u2019t hear no damn \u201cand then\u201d on \u201cBuy U a Drank\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02sorry T-Pain \u2014 Forever Filthy (@Taa_stee) November 30, 2017\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nwhen you ran \u201cBuy U A Drank\u201d back 5 times and T-Pain still says \u201cAAAAND THEEEENNN\u201d instead of \u201cOOOOWEEEE\u201d pic.twitter.com/i2M425dp8P \u2014 woke up like this* (@_DSav) November 29, 2017\n\nGoodnight everyone (except T-Pain who tried to change the lyrics of Buy U A Drank in 2017) Sleep tight \u2728 \u2014 Sol\u00e1na (@NalediSibisi) November 29, 2017\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWoke up saw the infinity war trailer then found out T-Pain says \u201cand theeen\u201d and not \u201cooo wee\u201d on Buy U A Drank.\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s been wild. \u2014 danielryanrod (@DanielRyanRod) November 29, 2017\n\nT-Pain wasn\u2019t done. Shortly after he cleared up the lyrics for \"Buy U a Drank,\" he turned his attention to the 2010 DJ Khaled track \"All I Do Is Win,\" which featured him, Rick Ross, Ludacris, and Snoop Dogg. Many people misheard the hook\u2019s lyrics as: \"Everybody hands go up / And they stay there, and stay there.\" But T-Pain revealed that the actual line is: \u201cAnd they stay there, and they say yeah.\u201d\n\nHe apologized for the misunderstanding.\n\nI don\u2019t wanna throw another wrench in your childhood but also it\u2019s \u201cEverybody hands go UP......... and they stay there....... AND THEY SAY YEAH\u201d sorry \ud83d\ude10 #AlliDoIsWin I\u2019m from #Tallahassee bro. That\u2019s just how some of us talk. \u2014 T-Pain (@TPAIN) November 29, 2017\n\nTwitter's mind was blown for a second time today:\n\nIt's too late to change All I Do is Win. My hands already went up and stayed there. And stayed there. No One said anything T-Pain. \u2014 Jenny (@MyCousinJenny) November 29, 2017\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nT-Pain really got me questioning my entire childhood by revealing what he was really saying in Buy U a Drank and All I Do Is Win... damn pic.twitter.com/0Nltv31row \u2014 Court \ud83c\udf88 (@LanaDelJournals) November 29, 2017\n\nI really feel dumb.
