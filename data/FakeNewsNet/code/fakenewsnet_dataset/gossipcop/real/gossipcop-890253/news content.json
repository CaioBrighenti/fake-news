That says it all. So I think that\u2019s an important thing to say and keep saying.\n\n\u201cWe as women have to support female directors. Hopefully it will change over time, but everybody keeps saying \u2018oh it\u2019s so different now, oh it\u2019s so different now\u2019, and it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Beguiled stars Kidman as the headmistress of a women\u2019s seminary during the American Civil War who takes in a wounded enemy solider, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Sofia Coppola, the film is an adaptation of the Thomas P. Cullinan novel of the same name. Cullinan\u2019s novel had previously been adapted by Don Siegel in a 1971 film that starred Clint Eastwood. Coppola said in the press conference that she wanted to reinterpret Siegel\u2019s film from a female perspective.\n\n\u201cThe original movie is told from a male point of view, it would be interesting to tell the story from the women\u2019s point of view, she said at the press conference. \u201cColin was our token male. He was a good sport about being our object.\u201d\n\nNicole Kidman in Cannes: her tortuous journey to Queen of the Croisette Read more\n\nDuring the press conference Coppola also addressed the ongoing Cannes debate over Netflix\u2019s practice of not giving films a theatrical release. \u201c[A film] always looks better seen on the big screen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shot it for the big frame and not a phone. I hope people will see it in the theatre. That experience is such a unique one, especially in our modern lives.\u201d\n\nThe Beguiled has received rave reviews from critics at the festival, with the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw describing it as \u201ca tremendously watchable movie, a drama-thriller with subtle touches of noir and black comedy.\u201d The film is released in US cinemas on 30 June and UK and Australian cinemas in July.",
