It's called \"Gorgeous,\" and the beginning of the song starts out with a baby\u2014like, an actual baby\u2014cooing the word gorgeous. Swift teased this detail about the track hours before she released it, but that's not stopping fans from obsessing to the max. Why did she make this call? And, more important, who the hell is the baby?\n\nTwitter might have the answer to that second question. The dominant fan theory with Swifties on social media right now is that Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' daughter, James, is the one saying \"gorgeous.\"\n\n\"It is rumoured that the child\u2019s voice at the start of Taylor\u2019s Swift\u2019s new song, #Gorgeous is Blake and Ryan\u2019s daughter James,\" a tweet from a Lively news Twitter handle reads. See it for yourself, below:\n\nAnd then there's this message from Swift herself on Tumblr. When a fan asked her the identity of the mystery baby, she said, \"300 people know,\" referring to the fans who've heard the album ahead of time during her Reputation secret sessions. A mysterious answer like this must mean something juicy, right?\n\nIt'd make total sense if baby James was the one behind \"Gorgeous.\" After all, Swift is really good friends with both Reynolds and Lively. She even paid the couple a visit to the hospital after Lively gave birth to her second child. The three of them, along with Swift's boyfriend Joe Alwyn, reportedly spent a weekend together in July at Swift's spacious Rhode Island pad. Maybe that's where Swift pitched this idea to Lively and Reynolds in the first place?\n\nIf this is true, baby James is definitely a contender for the Best Baby Feature Grammy Award I just made up.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d078ab5cf7bcf42c491a76d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1153173024.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e9e2c353fea83fa7e0215b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d066d9f8116e3707dac6595/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e9e2c353fea83fa7e0215b/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1507849003/glamour_senator-cory-booker-talks-about-the-importance-of-doing-good-for-others.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d191de1144d510008942c5f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1140636743.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e9e2c353fea83fa7e0215b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Natasha Reda", "Krystin Arneson", "Christopher Ros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/blake-lively-daughter-says-gorgeous-in-new-taylor-swift-song", "title": "Fans Think Blake Lively's Daughter Is the One Saying 'Gorgeous' in Taylor Swift's New Song", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "This celebrity baby is reportedly the one saying 'Gorgeous' in Taylor Swift's new song.
