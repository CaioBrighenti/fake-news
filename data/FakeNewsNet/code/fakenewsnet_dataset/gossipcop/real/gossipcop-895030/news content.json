Sure, you can watch Demi Lovato slay her song \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d and marvel at BTS\u2019 sick dance moves from the comfort of your couch, but there are somethings only audience members at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles could see on Sunday night.\n\nThankfully ET\u2019s got you covered with some insider observations from the epic show. Here were some of the best moments:\n\n1. The BTS Fandom Is Very Real\n\nThink this Korean boy band is all hype? Think again! According to an eyewitness, the crowd went \u201cinsane\u201d when the group took their seats and cheered even louder as they waved to fans in the crowd. The chaos continued throughout the show as the audience \u201cwent wild\u201d anytime the camera panned to the boys of BTS. Ahead of their performance, a chant of \u201cBTS\u201d filled the auditorium during the commercial break. One uber fan rocked a button-down shirt with all the members\u2019 faces on it, and the audience waved globe-shaped lights during the group\u2019s performance.\n\nWATCH: BTS Dish on Their History-Making American Music Awards Performance (Exclusive)\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n2. Proud Mom and Grandma\n\nDiana Ross stood up during her daughter Tracee Ellis Ross\u2019 entire opening. She had a huge smile on her face while watching Tracee. Diana went on to accept the Lifetime Achievement Award and treat fans to a stellar performance. But it was her 8-year-old grandson Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick \u2013 the son of Diana\u2019s daughter, Rhonda Ross Kendrick \u2013 who stole the show with his incredible dance moves. The crowd couldn\u2019t get enough of the little cutie as he busted a move on stage.\n\n3. Commercial Break Throwbacks\n\nDuring the commercial breaks, the audience at the Microsoft Theater watched past AMA performances.

Christina Aguilera\u2019s Quiet Reception\n\nThough Xtina\u2019s tribute to Whitney Houston received mixed reviews, the crowd seemed to enjoy the pop diva\u2019s medley of the late singer\u2019s songs. Cheers were kept to a minimum, however, as the audience waited for Aguilera to hit the high notes.\n\n5. Get on Your Feet!\n\nThough many performers received standing ovations, Demi Lovato, Alessia Cara, and, of course, BTS had the crowd on their feet for the entirety of their performances.\n\n6. RiRi\u2019s Army\n\nJust before Lady Gaga won the award for Favorite Female Pop/Rock Artist and accepted it live from her concert in Washington D.C., an audience member loudly shouted \u201cRihanna!\u201d The \u201cDiamonds\u201d singer was nominated in the same category.
