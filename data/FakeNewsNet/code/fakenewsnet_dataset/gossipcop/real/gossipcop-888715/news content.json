We didn\u2019t have any great inspiration. It wasn\u2019t Alexander the Great and Ella Fitzgerald.\u201d\n\nImage zoom George and Amal Clooney Franco Origlia/Getty Images\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Now, he\u2019s on double diaper duty with he and his wife\u2019s newborns \u2014 something the new dad told the Associated Press in August is \u201cmy job,\u201d along with \u201cwalking them around a little bit\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a life he\u2019s taking for granted. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think at 56 that I would be the parent of twins,\u201d George said, advising, \u201cDon\u2019t make plans. You always have to just enjoy the ride.\u201d\n\nImage zoom George Clooney Splash News Online\n\nRELATED: \u2018I\u2019m a Very Good Diaper Guy\u2019 and Everything Else George Clooney Has Said About Fatherhood Since Welcoming Twins Ella & Alexander\n\nAnd enjoying the ride he has been, gushing to ET on Sept. 1 about the twins\u2019 differing dispositions.\n\n\u201cThey start out with a personality right off the bat. [Alexander] is a thug already. You saw him,\u201d George said, gesturing longtime pal and Suburbicon star, Matt Damon. \u201cHe\u2019s a moose! Literally, he just sits and he eats.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks like he could bounce right now, some place in Hollywood,\u201d Damon chimed in. \u201cLike, checking IDs on the way into the nursery,\u201d George continued.\n\nIn contrast to Alexander, George said Ella is \u201cvery elegant and all eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe looks like Amal, thank God,\u201d he joked.", "images":
