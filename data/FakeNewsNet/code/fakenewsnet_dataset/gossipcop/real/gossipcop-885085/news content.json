Until Dewayne showed up,\u201d he wrote ominously, the latest in an ongoing feud between him and the former WWE champion.\n\n\u201cI tried to warn you guys,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou thought I was hating...... I was simply fighting to keep the family together.\u201d Doubtless Gibson is feeling more than a little aggrieved that Johnson is getting his own movie before the gang gets back together to film Fast & Furious 9, and this is not the first time he\u2019s called his co-star out on social media for trying to make the franchise all about The Rock. The ninth movie has been delayed a full year to April 10, 2020, while Johnson and Statham\u2019s spinoff, inspired by their delightful chemistry during The Fate of the Furious, is coming July 26, 2019. The spinoff news came only a day after the delay announcement, and Gibson smelled a rat.\n\nIn light of the news, Johnson simply tweeted, \u201cMy goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out. #HobbsShaw2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t address Gibson\u2019s concerns directly, but, listen, the fans can tell.\n\nVin Diesel, the leader of the franchise and the man whom Johnson once referred to as a \u201ccandy ass,\u201d has released a few cryptic social media posts, the first of which, on Friday, featured himself with Gibson and the late Paul Walker, and was simply titled \u201cBrotherhood\u2026\u201d\n\nJohnson is nowhere to be seen in the photo.
