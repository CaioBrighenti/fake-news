They were greeted by a driver with a white SUV. They looked very happy and blissful, all smiles, and the ring really stood out even from a distance.\n\nA bodyguard and a friend were also part of the boat ride.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Justin popped the very important question to Hailey during their vacation near Baker\u2019s Bay. The couple would also confirm the news in separate social media posts one day later.\n\n\u201cMy heart is COMPLETELY and FULLY YOURS and I will ALWAYS put you first! You are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn\u2019t want to spend it with anybody else. You make me so much better and we complement each other so well!! Can\u2019t wait for the best season of life yet!\u201d, Justin shared on Instagram.\n\nHailey would add: \u201cNot sure what I did in life to deserve such happiness but I am so utterly grateful to God for giving me such an incredible person to share my life with! No words could ever express my gratitude\u201d.\n\nAnd as congratulations and well wishes continue to pour in from family and friends around the world, one thing is clear: Love is in the air for these two young Hollywood stars.", "images": ["https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/d1.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1-2.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/d2-1-375x195.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/just2.jpg", "http://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lg-web2.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/xxx-145x100.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/World-stars-mag-updated1.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/d3-145x100.jpg", "http://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_5490.jpg", "http://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/j2.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/F210719E-D87C-443E-8584-A8F0CA03732E-145x100.jpeg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/s2-145x100.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/g2-145x100.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ww-375x195.jpg", "http://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/j3.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ddd-145x100.jpg"], "top_img": "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/just2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://worldstarsmag.com/2018/07/10/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-celebrate-engagement-romantic-boat-ride/", "title": "Justin Bieber & Hailey Baldwin Celebrate Their Engagement With Romantic Boat Ride", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber & Hailey Baldwin Celebrate Their Engagement With Romantic Boat Ride - Magazine", "description": "Olivia Anderson \u2013 World Stars Mag Just days after Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin got engaged in the Bahamas, the famous couple continued their romantic getaway with a morning boat ride.
