Read at your own risk!\n\nBy the end of his standalone series\u2019 second season, Luke Cage (Mike Colter) is no longer just Harlem\u2019s hero, but Harlem\u2019s\u2026crime boss?\n\nIn a final, shocking move, Mariah Dillard (Alfre Woodard) left Harlem\u2019s Paradise to Luke in her will. After her death, Luke \u2014 in an even more shocking move \u2014 decided to take it, thinking he\u2019ll be able to see criminal goings-on much more clearly from the perch above the club. Yet, in his final scene, he acts just like the crime bosses he hated, even donning a new wardrobe to underline his transformation.\n\nTo figure out what this means for the bulletproof Defender\u2019s future, EW chatted with Marvel\u2019s Luke Cage showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker, who penned the finale. Below, Coker dives into Luke\u2019s decision, how he chose which villains to feature in season 2, and what he thinks of criticisms over the show being too long.\n\nImage zoom David Lee/Netflix\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Is Luke 100 percent comfortable with his choice to take over Harlem\u2019s Paradise, to essentially become just like the people he vowed to remove? He can\u2019t be, can he?\n\nCHEO HODARI COKER: When we filmed the episode, the script called for Luke to be more reluctant, to reluctantly look out at all that he surveyed. Mike didn\u2019t play it like that. To his credit, he refused all notes to play it differently, and he absolutely made the right choice, because it\u2019s chilling. If you immediately go from watching episode 13 of season 2 and go back to episode 1 of season 1, it\u2019s chilling how much Mike in that three-piece suit looks like Cottonmouth [played by Mahershala Ali].\n\nThe tonal shift can be shocking, but once given power, people kind of show off who they really are. That was what Mariah was trying to say, that you often go in thinking that things are going to be different when it\u2019s your administration, but [once you\u2019re there] you start making the kinds of decisions that the previous administration made. It\u2019s the same lesson that Michael Corleone got [in The Godfather]\u2026 So, is my view for Luke Cage, or Luke Corleone, more pessimistic? I would say no, but it\u2019s interesting to play with.\n\nYou call him \u201cLuke Corleone\u201d; D.W. [Jeremiah Craft] calls him \u201cLuke Trump\u201d in an earlier scene. Luke\u2019s getting a lot of nicknames that are nothing like \u201cHarlem\u2019s hero.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson from [The Wire creator] David Simon. He used season 3 of The Wire to not only talk about a war between two drug organizations in Baltimore, but also to describe the then-current Iraq War\u2026 So for us, it\u2019s like, are we making an analogy about the Trump administration? Yes, we are, but if you don\u2019t get the references, it\u2019s okay.\n\nNow the only fear I have is that someone would make the mistake of having the notion that Luke is conservative. God forbid somebody misinterprets that line as us trying to give Trump a shout-out. That\u2019s not the case at all. What we\u2019re saying is that this place is shaken up by a reformer who has no experience, who thinks that having all power is going to solve things. That\u2019s dangerous. That\u2019s what D.W. is saying. I think, ultimately, [the comparison] elevates the season.\n\nWhat made you want to end the season on this note? Was there something that compelled you to wrap up the season without the superhero being the moral compass, or even in the right? Why end like this?\n\nBecause I want people to clamor for a season 3. [Laughs] If all is well and everything\u2019s great, then, like, I\u2019d rather play Fortnite, you know? [Laughs] I want people to question who Luke Cage is. If season 1 was \u201cWho is Luke Cage?\u201d then season 2 is \u201cThis is Luke Cage,\u201d but then season 3 is \u201cWho is Luke Cage, really?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Mariah, who\u2019s murdered by her own daughter, Tilda [Gabrielle Dennis], and departs the show. How did Alfre react to being told she\u2019d be leaving the series?\n\nAt the very beginning of the season, when I told her the Tilda twist, she screamed at the table, \u201cOh my God!\u201d As I talked to her about the things she was going to do, she said, \u201cY\u2019all are going to kill me this season, aren\u2019t you?\u201d [Laughs] I said, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re killing you,\u201d and she said, \u201cAlright, when you kill me, just make sure I don\u2019t go out like a punk.\u201d Alfre wanted to go out in a blaze of glory, but I said, \u201cNo one\u2019s going to shoot you. It\u2019s going to be a lot more emotional than that.\u201d I love writing for Alfre. She\u2019s so playful. She makes for a wonderful villain.\n\nImage zoom Sarah Shatz/Netflix\n\nSpeaking of villains, I was expecting Diamondback [Erik LaRay Harvey] to show up again after last season\u2019s tease. Why not include him at all this season?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I love Diamondback, and I love Erik LaRay Harvey. It was Erik\u2019s audition for Cottonmouth that changed the trajectory of the series. He gave such an incredible Cottonmouth audition that it made us say, \u201cOkay, we gotta reassess the age of Cottonmouth and, knowing that we have such a strong actor for the back half of the season, let\u2019s cast Erik as Diamondback and look for another Cottonmouth.\u201d\n\nI had always planned on killing Cottonmouth off. That was always going to be the twist. What none of us anticipated was that, while we knew that Mahershala was going to be incredible, we didn\u2019t know that people were going to be so emotionally attached to him that they would be pissed at the show for killing him. It was really hard on Erik because, as [Marvel TV head] Jeph Loeb said, \u201cMahershala couldn\u2019t follow Mahershala.\u201d [Laughs]\n\nSo it might have been interesting to follow up immediately with Diamondback, but again, that\u2019s the thing: There will hopefully be other opportunities to explore different storylines. I\u2019m extremely happy with the one that we have right now.\n\nJust to clarify, your decision not to bring Diamondback back this season was because of the fan reaction?\n\nIt\u2019s honestly because of, if you follow the Marvel pattern, it\u2019s like, you don\u2019t directly follow up with last season\u2019s storyline immediately. Look at something like Daredevil: They did [season 2 with] the Punisher and other storylines.\n\nSo that means if you get a third season, we won\u2019t see Bushmaster [Mustafa Shakir] return?\n\nI mean, if I tell you everything, why watch season 3? [Laughs]\n\nImage zoom Netflix; Myles Aronowitz/Netflix\n\nFair enough \u2014 but what is the status on season 3?\n\nNetflix likes critical attention and they like their analytics. I think review-wise, we\u2019ve done pretty well. People seem to like the show except for [Rolling Stone TV critic] Alan Sepinwall, but so be it. I come from hip-hop \u2014 meaning that I don\u2019t mind if you come at me. In fact, I prefer it. But I prefer that you come at the show with credible critique. Don\u2019t say, \u201cOut of 13 hours, only four weren\u2019t a waste of time.\u201d I really felt that [Vulture writer] Angelica Basti\u00e9n\u2018s criticisms of the show last season were so eloquent and so well written that her challenges to us helped the show.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a former critic, I view criticism differently than most do. I can take criticism but if you\u2019re going to eviscerate us, be specific. Don\u2019t be lazy, because I can tell whether or not you\u2019ve seen all 13. But to get back to your question: Netflix always likes to take their time to think about things. Do things look good for a season 3? I hope, but it\u2019s really going to depend on having enough people watch the show. And I never assume anything, because we\u2019re living in an era where Martin Scorsese doesn\u2019t get a second season. Anybody can get canceled.\n\nBut because you mentioned Sepinwall\u2019s review, in which he talks about how there\u2019s not enough story to fill 13 episodes, I do have to ask: What do you think about the season\u2019s length? Would you prefer fewer episodes?\n\nNo. Honestly, it\u2019s like jazz. In the bebop era, it used to be that you only had three minutes to make a song. But once you were able to not have three minutes and you could do 25 minutes, it changed the nature of jazz composition. It\u2019s like John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins \u2014 it changes jazz because you could stretch.\n\nNow, if he\u2019s saying every episode needs to be a pop single, he can have that Britney Spears s\u2014. You know? Like, he wants Taylor Swift, Britney Spears. We\u2019re trying to make Zeppelin records. He\u2019s probably the kind of person who thinks that \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d is a waste of time, you know what I\u2019m saying? Like, God forbid that song meanders, especially as it builds to its climax. He\u2019s the kind of person who probably wanted to edit \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d you know? There will be some people who prefer that stretch and then some people who are like, \u201cYou know what, I like pop.\u201d And I get it. It\u2019s cool. There\u2019s literally a million other things you could be doing, but if you like what we\u2019re doing, then I want to give the fans who like what we\u2019re doing as much as they can take.\n\nIs there anything else you want to add?\n\nI really love the season, and I hope people enjoy it. I know that we could not have tried any harder. I know that we pushed as many buttons as we could, and I\u2019m satisfied that we tried our best. I learned a long time ago as a journalist who covered A Tribe Called Quest and Dr. Dre and a lot of artists that pushed boundaries, that they take creative risks because safe records don\u2019t move the needle. Sometimes you have to take the risk that somebody will consider what you\u2019re making is noise, but if you don\u2019t try it, then nothing will move forward. I\u2019d rather people hate something than just go \u201cmeh.\u201d I want people to be enthralled by the show and I hope in this second season, we did something enthralling.\n\nMarvel\u2019s Luke Cage season 2 is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nRELATED: Get the lowdown on the Emmys with EW\u2019s CHASING EMMY podcast", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/43.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/990037df28aa5e76fee20e205f4c69af?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/0253_tiara_201_unit_04868r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/002_gt_103_unit_05488r41.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/terror_202_ea_0124_0196_rt.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/lukecage1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/0436_tiara_201_unit_02592r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/euphoria-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/lukecage2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/dtm_106_unit_00129_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/150671_0185-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/lukecage2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/lukecage2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/06/22/marvels-luke-cage-boss-breaks-down-chilling-season-2-finale-defends-13-episode-seasons/", "title": "Marvel's Luke Cage boss breaks down 'chilling' season 2 finale, defends 13-episode seasons", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Cheo Hodari Coker,Marvel,Mike Colter", "news_keywords": "Cheo Hodari Coker,Marvel,Mike Colter", "description": "Showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker insists critics are wrong about the show needing fewer episodes.", "og": {"title": "'Marvel's Luke Cage' boss breaks down 'chilling' season 2 finale, defends 13-episode seasons", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/06/22/marvels-luke-cage-boss-breaks-down-chilling-season-2-finale-defends-13-episode-seasons/", "description": "Warning: The following contains spoilers for season 2 of\u00a0Marvel's Luke Cage.
