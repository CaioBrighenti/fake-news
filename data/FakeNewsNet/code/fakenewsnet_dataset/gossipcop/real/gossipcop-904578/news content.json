Emma Watson and Robert Pattinson had a surprise Harry Potter reunion as they appeared together to present an award, and fans could not handle the excitement.\n\nThe actors, who played Hermione Granger and Cedric Diggory in the franchise, were on hand to present the Best Limited Series or TV Movie award. Standing side by side \u2014 both in all black in support of the Time\u2019s Up movement \u2014 they transported fans back to 2005, when they starred opposite each other in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\n\nGoF was the only film in the franchise that featured Pattinson\u2019s Cedric (RIP), while Watson of course went on to appear in all eight movies based on the JK Rowling book series.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a decade since the stars appeared on the big screen together, and fans could not handle the sight of them together again, taking to social media to scream in excitement.\n\nI'M SORRY BUT TO INTRODUCE EMMA WATSON AND ROBERT PATTINSON AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN HERMIONE GRANGER AND CEDRIC DIGGORY IS ABSOLUTELY DISRESPECTFUL!!! #GoldenGlobes \u2014 Alise Navidad (@fatlise) January 8, 2018\n\nI\u2019m still shook that Hermione Granger and Cedric Diggory got to present an award together. #GoldenGlobes \u2014 Eliz\u03b1beth Jay (@heyelizajay) January 8, 2018\n\nEMMA WATSON AND ROBERT PATTINSON PRESENTING TOGETHER I\u2019M SHAKING HERMIONE AND CEDRIC \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d #GoldenGlobes \u2014 Lorenzo \u265a (@bbbfffds8) January 8, 2018\n\nOne eagle-eyed fan even pointed out that it wasn\u2019t just Watson and Pattinson filling out the HP universe at the Globes.\n\n\u201cThe Harry Potter nerd in me wants to point out that Sirius, Lupin, Hermione, and Cedric are all at the #GoldenGlobes. Did I miss anyone else?\u201d she tweeted, referring to the fact that Gary Oldman and David Thewlis were also in attendance. (Oldman won Best Actor in a Drama Motion Picture for Darkest Hour, while Thewlis was nominated for his role in Fargo.)\n\nAnother fan took particular pride in the pair\u2019s attire, tweeting, \u201cA Hermione Granger and Cedric Diggory reunion, AND they\u2019re supporting#TIMESUP??? We stan legends.\u201d We\u2019re sure the rest of the fandom would agree.\n\nWere you excited to see Hermione and Cedric together at the Golden Globes?
