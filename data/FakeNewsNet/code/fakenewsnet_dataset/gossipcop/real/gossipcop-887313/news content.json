I dress modestly. I don\u2019t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.\u201d\n\nShe immediately followed that statement, at the center of the controversy, with, \u201cWomen should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want. Why are we the ones who have to police our behavior?\u201d", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
