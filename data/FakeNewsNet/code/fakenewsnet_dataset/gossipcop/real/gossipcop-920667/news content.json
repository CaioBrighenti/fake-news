So Gigi was spotted out with her friend Samuel Krost, and many paparazzi agencies immediately referred to him as her \"mystery man\". Gigi then took to Twitter to shut down any romance rumours, writing, \"If you outlets are going to continue writing bs headlines every time I\u2019m seen with a friend of the male gender then there\u2019s going to be a lot of unneeded confusion \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude11\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f [sic]\"\n\nIf you outlets are going to continue writing bs headlines every time I\u2019m seen with a friend of the male gender then there\u2019s gunna be a lot of unneeded confusion \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude11\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u2014 Gigi Hadid (@GiGiHadid) April 4, 2019\n\nTo any dumb fuck out there that wants to make they\u2019re own stories up \u2014 zayn (@zaynmalik) April 4, 2019\n\nLater, Zayn tweeted, \"To any dumb fuck out there that wants to make their own stories up\", which many assumed was fighting Gigi's corner about the photos.\n\nThe singer later took to Twitter again, though, to not only deny his original tweet was about his ex-girlfriend, but to shut down any trolls who were attacking the model on social media. He wrote:\n\n\"My tweet was not about @GiGiHadid so leave her the f*** alone she is the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever known / And does nothing but love and support me when lord knows I don\u2019t deserve it / So if you have anything to say @ me and I\u2019ll put you the f*** straight / If you know nothing shut your fucking mouth.\"\n\nMy tweet was not about @GiGiHadid so leave her the fuck alone she is the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever known \u2014 zayn (@zaynmalik) April 4, 2019\n\nAnd does nothing but love and support me when lord knows I don\u2019t deserve it \u2014 zayn (@zaynmalik) April 4, 2019\n\nSo if you have anything to say @ me and I\u2019ll put you the fuck straight \u2014 zayn (@zaynmalik) April 4, 2019\n\nIf you know nothing shut your fucking mouth \u2014 zayn (@zaynmalik) April 4, 2019\n\nWe're as confused as you are about what's going on, but one thing is for sure: Zayn is still full of love for Gigi.\n\nCheck out the rest of their relationship timeline here.\n\nNovember 2015: Zayn and Gigi first spark romance rumours a few short weeks after she ends thing with Joe Jonas.

This is all just very frustrating and I'm only human ... I've seen the s--t on this account for just as long as u- and have too stand quiet. - I've just had enough.. just because I'm 'a celebrity' doesn't mean I don't feel, or that my time is too precious to not listen to what people have to say.
