But later that day at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, the actress wasn\u2019t seen wearing the ring.\n\nImage zoom Flight Photo Agency\n\nImage zoom Flight Photo Agency\n\nThe couple recently celebrated their first anniversary in early December. Hudson took to her Instagram to celebrate the occasion and explained that she and Fujikawa first crossed paths because of her friendship with his stepsisters. However, she was \u201cenormously pregnant\u201d with her 13-year-old son Ryder with ex-husband Chris Robinson at their earliest encounter.\n\n\u201cA year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date,\u201d she captioned the post. \u201cNo moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter. So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it\u2019s been truly incredible!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Fujikawa and Hudson Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nHudson and Fujikawa made their red carpet debut as a couple in May while attending the premiere of Hawn\u2019s movie Snatched. Romance rumors first started after the pair were spotted kissing during an L.A. lunch date in March.\n\nRELATED: Kate Hudson, Sophia Bush and More Celebs Took a Bold Risk with This Lip Color on the Red Carpet\n\nSince then, the couple has been spotted all over the world. From going for a night out in N.Y.C. to celebrating Hudson\u2019s birthday together in L.A. to Cambodia, where the couple took a trip together in June.\n\nIt appears Fujikawa fits right into Hudson\u2019s hipster lifestyle. \u201cKate\u2019s a free spirit who has always been attracted to musicians,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE. \u201cBut Danny also appeals to her because he is talented, bright and cosmopolitan like she is.\u201d\n\nHudson was previously married to The Black Crowes singer Robinson for six years. She was also previously engaged to Muse frontman Matt Bellamy, with whom she shares 7-year-old son Bingham. They were engaged for four years before calling it quits in 2014.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/american-pie-reunion.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kate-hudson-ring-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/brad.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kate-hudson-ring-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C1454px%2C764px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10332136d.jpg?crop=0px%2C453px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/robert-redford-zach-galifianakis.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lexi-rabe.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/fujikawa-hudson-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lexi-rabe-1.jpg?crop=26px%2C4px%2C793px%2C416px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/beckhams-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/julia-roberts3.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C1500px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-50720196.jpg?crop=3px%2C174px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rdj.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/angelina-jolie-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1447px%2C759.675px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/meg-ryan-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sophia-loren-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1661px%2C872.025px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/wimbledon-2-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/emma-roberts-1.jpg?w=732", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jessica-chastain-bryce-dallas-howard.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tom-holland-brother.jpg?crop=0px%2C66px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/cameron-boyce-salma-hayek.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2001px%2C1050.525px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/152704_1235.jpg?crop=0px%2C295px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kate-hudson-ring-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/brad-leo-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C71px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kate-hudson-ring-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C82px%2C1454px%2C764px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ale Russian"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/is-kate-hudson-engaged-actress-spotted-with-ring-on-her-wedding-finger-while-riding-dirt-bike/", "title": "Is Kate Hudson Engaged?
