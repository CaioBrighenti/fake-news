{"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6", "text": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story.\" Disney/Lucasfilm\n\nThe box-office struggles of \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could result in a loss of at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated $250 million production budget and marketing costs that likely doubled its total budget.\n\nB. Riley FBR senior analyst Barton Crockett told THR that \"Solo\" will lose more than $50 million, while other industry financing sources told the outlet that the loss could exceed $80 million, depending on auxiliary revenues and the undisclosed, exact terms of Disney's deal for the film.\n\n\"Solo\" dropped 65% at the box office in its second weekend of release, and its global box office total currently stands at $264.3 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n\"Solo\" also bombed in its opening weekend in China, as Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio reported. The film brought in only $10.1 million over Memorial Day weekend in China, a record low for \"Star Wars\" films in the country, though the franchise itself has historically never grabbed the attention of China, the world's second-largest movie market.\n\nIf it doesn't see a late surge, as analysts are predicting it won't, \"Solo\" will become the first movie from Disney and Lucasfilm to lose money.\n\n2017's \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" brought in $1.332 billion at the global box office, while the first \"Star Wars\" spin-off \"Rogue One\" grossed $1.056 billion in 2016.\n\nThe first collaboration from Disney and Lucasfilm, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" grossed $2.068 billion in 2015, setting off a renewal of the \"Star Wars\" series that is now likely to see its first miss in \"Solo.\"", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b168df21ae6624e008b4871-750-562.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b1691fe1ae6624f008b4890-750-375.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b1691fe1ae6624f008b4890-750-375.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Lynch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6", "title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-06-05", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-05", "news_keywords": "Movies, Culture, Solo A Star Wars Story, Star Wars, Disney, Lucasfilm, Box Office, John Lynch", "sailthru.tags": "Movies, Culture, Solo A Star Wars Story, Star Wars, Disney, Lucasfilm, Box Office, John Lynch", "description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "sailthru.description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire, clusterstock, sai, thelife, media", "sailthru.title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b1691fe1ae6624f008b4890-750-375.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b1691d31ae6621f008b4bbe-640-481.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b1691d31ae6621f008b4bbe-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "sailthru.author": "John Lynch", "og": {"title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b1691fe1ae6624f008b4890-750-375.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "John Lynch", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6", "title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b1691fe1ae6624f008b4890-750-375.jpg", "creator": "@johnperrylynch", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528171200.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
