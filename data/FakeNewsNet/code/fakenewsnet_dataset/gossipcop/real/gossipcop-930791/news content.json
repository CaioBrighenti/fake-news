Congrats #Avengers. pic.twitter.com/voJshTKx5E \u2014 Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) April 29, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, Infinity Wars stars Chadwick Boseman, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Holland went on Jimmy Kimmel Live to read some Mean Tweets.\n\nAnd here EW explains that Infinity Wars post-credits scene, while Anthony Breznican gives some background about the surprise keeper of the Soul Stone.\n\nOne more link for you: Marvel movies ranked by how much money they made.\n\nMeanwhile, there will be a bit of wait to see how that cliffhanger will be resolved. The follow-up to Infinity War will be released on May 3, 2019.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/episode-ix.jpg?crop=0px%2C174px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/rev-1-gkm-fp-201r_high_res_jpeg.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ant-man-a.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/x-men-bts-7-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C129px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/df-15250_rv2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/star-wars-galaxys-edge-8.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/07_p544_119a_progression.prog16.653.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/df-28400_rv2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/costner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/far-from-home-endgame.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/mid-d36-13692-re.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8507038badc1c41adb48fd6b51538fbd?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/burn.jpg?crop=11px%2C0px%2C2977px%2C1562.925px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/thecurrentwar_tlr-1_hd1920x1080_prores422hqrec709_st51_20190619.00_00_51_20.still092-copy.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C3429px%2C1800.225px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/men-in-black-intl-dom-df-00398_r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/duo_lean1.gif", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/infinitywar5ae2817397fca.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3413px%2C1791.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/avengersendgame5ce30b0b72b43.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/july-4th-movies.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/am12.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/avengersendgame5ce30b0be728c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/avengersendgame5cd9fa91978f5.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/infinitywar5ae2817397fca.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3413px%2C1791.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/30/avengers-infinity-war-opening-weekend-box-office/", "title": "Avengers: Infinity War has biggest box office opening weekend ever", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Avengers: Infinity War", "news_keywords": "Avengers: Infinity War", "description": "'Infinity War' blows past 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' for $640.9 million globally in less than a week", "og": {"title": "It's official: 'Avengers: Infinity War' has biggest box office opening weekend ever", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/30/avengers-infinity-war-opening-weekend-box-office/", "description": "'Infinity War' blows past 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' for $640.9 million globally in less than a week", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/infinitywar5ae2817397fca.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3413px%2C1791.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/30/avengers-infinity-war-opening-weekend-box-office/", "description": "'Infinity War' blows past 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' for $640.9 million globally in less than a week", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/infinitywar5ae2817397fca.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3413px%2C1791.825px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/04/30/avengers-infinity-war-opening-weekend-box-office/", "title": "It's official: 'Avengers: Infinity War' has biggest box office opening weekend ever", "description": "'Infinity War' blows past 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' for $640.9 million globally in less than a week", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/infinitywar5ae2817397fca.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3413px%2C1791.825px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525060800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
