It was not a pleasant experience for Jones, and he made it crystal clear to Carrey, the Truman Show actor explained.\n\n\"I was the star and that was the problem,\" Carrey guessed. \"He's a phenomenal actor, though. I still love him.\"\n\nThe situation came to a head in the middle of production, before the two had their \"biggest scene together\" on the Joel Schumacher film, when Carrey randomly popped into the same restaurant that Jones was having dinner, he told Macdonald.\n\n\"The maitre said, 'Oh, I hear you're working with Tommy Lee Jones. He's over in the corner having dinner.' I went over and I said, 'Hey Tommy, how are you doing?' and the blood just drained from his face,\" Carrey said. \"And he got up shaking \u2014 he must have been in mid kill me fantasy or something like that. And he went to hug me and he said, 'I hate you. I really don't like you.' And I said, 'What's the problem?' and pulled up a chair, which probably wasn't smart. And he said, 'I cannot sanction your buffoonery.'\"\n\nMacdonald said Jones' ire likely came from Carrey, who had risen quickly to become a huge star, being the center of attention no matter the room he entered.\n\nCarrey had a different theory.\n\n\"He might have been uncomfortable doing that work, too,\" he said. \"That's not really his style of stuff.\"\n\nHear Carrey's story about Jones at the 1:08:30 mark. And for more from Batman Forever, read Heat Vision's oral history from 2015, which explains how hesitant Jones was about taking the part.", "images": ["https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/blogs/promoflag-thr-latest-news.png?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2019/06/spider-man-_far_from_home-publicity_still_13-h_2019.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/batman_forever_3_1.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2019/06/halle_bailey_little_mermaid_split.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/batman_forever_3_1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Parker", "Richard New", "Lexy Perez", "Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/tommy-lee-jones-hated-working-jim-carrey-batman-forever-1045176", "title": "Tommy Lee Jones Really Hated Working With Jim Carrey on 'Batman Forever'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\"I went over and I said, 'Hey Tommy, how are you doing?' and the blood just drained from his face.\"", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/tommy-lee-jones-hated-working-jim-carrey-batman-forever-1045176", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Tommy Lee Jones Really Hated Working With Jim Carrey on 'Batman Forever'", "description": "\"I went over and I said, 'Hey Tommy, how are you doing?' and the blood just drained from his face.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/10/batman_forever_3_1.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Tommy Lee Jones Really Hated Working With Jim Carrey on 'Batman Forever'", "description": "\"I went over and I said, 'Hey Tommy, how are you doing?' and the blood just drained from his face.\"", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/tommy-lee-jones-hated-working-jim-carrey-batman-forever-1045176", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/batman_forever_3_1.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Tommy Lee Jones Really Hated Working With Jim Carrey on 'Batman Forever'", "sailthru.description": "\"I went over and I said, 'Hey Tommy, how are you doing?' and the blood just drained from his face.\"", "sailthru.author": "Ryan Parker", "sailthru.channel": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.vertical": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-03 09:31:43", "sailthru.tags": "Heat Vision, Movies, Jim Carrey, Tommy Lee Jones"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHG7mHKwQqA"], "publish_date": 1507037503.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
