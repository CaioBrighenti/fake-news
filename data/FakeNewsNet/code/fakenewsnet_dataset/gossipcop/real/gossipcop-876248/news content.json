The episode also revealed that Jon\u2019s real name is actually Aegon Targaryen and that Daenerys is his aunt.\n\nSo when Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen made love on their boat ride to the North, fans were freaked out by the incestuous scene. The same goes for the actors that played the characters, Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke.\n\nThe Game of Thrones stars admitted that they were blown away by the revelation that complicates their budding romance.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Emilia Clarke shared her thoughts on how Daenerys will react when she finds out that Jon is her nephew. The 30-year-old actress predicted that the Mother of Dragons will probably be grossed out by the incestuous pairing.\n\n\u201cEwwwww! I think that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to go. I get the toothbrush\u2014\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Jon (Aegon) being the rightful heir to the throne, Emilia Clarke insisted that she has no plans to give up or share it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard, I don\u2019t want to share that throne. No. The throne\u2019s big enough for one dragon bum, and that\u2019s mine. That\u2019s it!\u201d\n\n'Game of Thrones' star Emilia Clarke predicted that Daenerys will probably be grossed out by the [Image by Matt Sayles/AP Images]\n\nAs for how the truth will impact Jon (Aegon) and Daenerys\u2019 relationship, Kit Harington admitted that he cannot predict that part yet. The 30-year-old actor shared his opinion as to what could possibly happen to the couple.\n\n\u201cThat part of it, I can\u2019t predict. It could be them walking off into the sunset. It could be them killing each other.\u201d\n\nThe showrunners of Game of Thrones appeared to agree that the revelation would change Jon (Aegon) and Daenerys\u2019 relationship. D.B. Weiss revealed that the truth \u201cwill inevitably, if not tear them apart, at least cause real problems in their relationship.\u201d\n\nDavid Benioff backed up the claims, adding that it complicates something that would\u2019ve been \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nKit Harington admitted that the revelation will definitely affect Jon and Deanarys romance.

The actor admitted that the length of their time together in Game of Thrones has helped a lot in delivering their scenes effectively.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both kind of freaking out about it. I would be like, \u2018What\u2019s the sexual tension in this scene?\u2019 and she\u2019s like, \u2018Stop talking about sexual tension!\u2019 It\u2019s a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.\u201d\n\nEmilia Clarke then quipped, \u201cYeah [I would say], \u2018Would you just stop? Just give me some sexy eyes, don\u2019t keep talking about sexual chemistry all the time.'\u201d\n\nThe actress also added that she actually preferred that it was all action and fewer words. \u201cI love that when we get to the saucy stuff it\u2019s a beautiful acceptance of a wordless \u2026 yep.\u201d\n\n[Featured Image by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kit-Harington-Emilia-Clarke-1.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d4beb6dae76d06be0ac3ac9fccf03064?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1472001486461948&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=478801082325642&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Melissa-Riso-300x170.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Emilia-Clarke-Kit-Harington-2.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kit-Harington-Emilia-Clarke.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Van Bermudez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4464429/game-of-thrones-stars-kit-harington-and-emilia-clarke-react-on-incestuous-finale-ewwww/", "title": "\u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Stars Kit Harington And Emilia Clarke React To Finale: \u2018Ewwww!\u2019 [Spoilers]", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
