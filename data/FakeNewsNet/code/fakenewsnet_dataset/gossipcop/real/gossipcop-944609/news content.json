Keeping Up with the Kardashians star took to her website and app to honor her brother, revealing all the ways he reminds her of their late father, Robert Kardashian Sr.\n\n\u201cMy brother Rob is like my father in so many ways \u2014 his sense of humor, silly nature, the way he loves and respects family,\u201d she said.\n\nKhlo\u00e9, 33, praised Rob, 31, for his relationship with his 1\u00bd-year-old daughter Dream, whom he shares with ex Blac Chyna.\n\nRELATED: 44 Impossibly Cute Photos of Rob Kardashian & Blac Chyna\u2019s Baby Girl Dream\n\n\u201cMy dad would do anything for

implement his Armenian roots into Dream\u2019s upbringing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would mean so much to him that all of his grandchildren are so close,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s family over everything and I love that my brother is the same way.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Shares New Photo of Daughter True After Date Night with Tristan Thompson\n\nEarlier this month, a

healthy even though he says he wants to be,\u201d said the insider. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly up and down.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Rob and Dream Kardashian Rob Kardashian/Twitter\n\nStill, close friends
