It\u2019s hard at first, but it gets easier. I am not perfect at it, but it does make a difference for my anxiety and my noise in my mind,\u201d she advised, adding, \u201cAlso: I finally caved and started meditating. after 1 million people told me to start & I have to say, it does make a huuuge difference in my anxiety. I thought it would be the opposite, but after a few times, you start to notice its effects. I 100% recommend.\u201d\n\nnone of us are ok 100% of the time and that\u2019s ok. you are so loved. and even if you don\u2019t have someone in your life who directly understands, you are also so universally understood. i wish you so much love & light & growth. i love you. always here, never alone.
