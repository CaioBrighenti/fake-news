Host Jimmy Kimmel, who is Pitt and Aniston\u2019s mutual friend, reportedly wanted to make history by doing a joint interview with the exes, according to Radar Online. One insider claimed that chances are \u201cpretty good\u201d that it is happening. Kimmel, 49, \u201cis super close to Jen, but he\u2019s also really good friends with Pitt disciples Peter Dante and David Fincher,\u201d the source said.\n\nREAD: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon reuniting in a new TV show\n\nThe insider added that Kimmel has initiated a move to make this happen. \u201cJimmy sent a message to Brad that he\u2019s a welcome presence at the show, even just to hang out in the bar area backstage and schmooze,\u201d the source said. \u201cBrad is a priority for Jimmy. He wants his show to be Brad\u2019s first stop from now on.\u201d\n\nThe talk show host reportedly believes that it\u2019s time for the exes to appear in public together, especially now that Pitt is divorcing Angelina Jolie, whom many believe was the reason his and Aniston\u2019s divorce. \u201cBrad\u2019s free of Angelina, and Jimmy thinks he can make this happen. He\u2019s really tight with Jen and she trusts him,\u201d the insider added.\n\nThe report, however, should be taken with a grain of salt. According to E! News, there is no truth to the claims and that Aniston and Pitt have no plans to reconcile on national television.\n\nWhile Aniston is unlikely to reunite with Pitt on the small screen, her reunion with her \u201cFriends\u201d co-star Reese Witherspoon is already in the works. The two played the roles of sisters in the hit NBC sitcom. Aniston and Witherspoon are set to star in an original TV series that will cover morning shows and the larger media scene in New York, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAniston and Witherspoon\u2019s reunion is expected to draw interest from multiple bidders. The untitled series will be offered to premium cable outlets including HBO and to streaming services like Netflix.\n\nDo you want Aniston and Pitt to reunite in a joint interview?
