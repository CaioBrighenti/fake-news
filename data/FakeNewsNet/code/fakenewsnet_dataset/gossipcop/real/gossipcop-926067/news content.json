But now, over a decade after the show has ended, the former co-stars appear to be in a good place.\n\nHilton, 37, and Richie, 36, were photographed happily chatting at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards in L.A. on Sunday, giving fans hope that a reboot of The Simple Life isn\u2019t totally out of the question.\n\nImage zoom Stefanie Keenan/Getty\n\nHilton, who showed off her gigantic 20-carat, $2 million engagement ring, went for full-on glam wearing a black, plunging Philipp Plein belted gown featuring a high slit, paired with jeweled pumps, while Richie opted for a natural makeup look and donned a pink floral dress featuring beautiful beading along with Jimmy Choo accessories.\n\nImage zoom David Crotty/Patrick McMullan/Getty\n\nLooking for more style content?
