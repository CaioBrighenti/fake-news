I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa,\u201d she added, referencing Weinstein\u2019s estranged wife Georgina Chapman\u2019s fashion line.\n\nImage zoom Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic\n\nIt has not been confirmed if Streep \u2014 who received a Globes nomination for her role in The Post \u2014 will be among the major actresses wearing black.\n\nWhen asked by Extra about whether she would be taking part in the protest at the Golden Globes, the 68-year-old actress said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not talking. You gotta tune in, don\u2019t ya?\u201d\n\nActresses, like Meryl Streep, who happily worked for The Pig Monster, are wearing black @GoldenGlobes in a silent protest. YOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You\u2019ll accept a fake award breathlessly & affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa. \u2014 rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) December 16, 2017\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ashley Judd and Multiple Women Accuse Movie Mogul Harvey Weinstein of Sexual Harassment as He Announces Leave of Absence\n\nIn October, Streep became one of the first actresses to speak out against the disgraced producer.\n\n\u201cThe disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported,\u201d said Streep in a statement. \u201cThe intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,\u201d she added. \u201cI didn\u2019t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,\u201d she continued. \u201cEach brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Meryl Streep Calls Out Harvey Weinstein in Statement About Sexual Harassment Allegations\n\nOver 50 women have accused Weinstein, 65, of sexual assault and misconduct since The New York Times and The New Yorker documented decades of alleged sexual misconduct and sexual assault involving a number of women in detailed articles in October. McGowan was one of the first women to come forward \u2014 accusing the producer of rape.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Weinstein\u2019s attorneys have denied any allegations of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein has never at any time committed an act of sexual assault, and it is wrong and irresponsible to conflate claims of impolitic behavior or consensual sexual contact later regretted, with an untrue claim of criminal conduct,\u201d his lawyers said. \u201cThere is a wide canyon between mere allegation and truth, and we are confident that any sober calculation of the facts will prove no legal wrongdoing occurred.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, to those offended by Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior, he remains deeply apologetic.\u201d", "images":
