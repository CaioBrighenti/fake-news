After a fan asked Grande if the symbol had a hidden meaning, the pop star simply stated that it was because she was feeling \u201cempty.\u201d\n\n\u201cjk i\u2019m empty and my heart is black now so,\u201d she tweeted on Nov. 15.\n\nImage zoom Ariana Grande's tweet Ariana Grande/Twitter\n\nRELATED: Every Single Tattoo Pete Davidson & Ariana Grande Have Gotten to Make Their Love Permanent\n\nDavidson and Grande have a total of five shared designs and nine total tattoos inspired by their whirlwind romance.\n\nThe former couple also shared clouds on their finger, the quote \u201cmille tendresse\u201d from the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s on the backs of their necks, and \u201c8418\u201d in honor of Davidson\u2019s late father who died in 9/11 on the singer\u2019s ankle and the comedian\u2019s arm.\n\nIn addition, the pair had the word \u201creborn\u201d and \u201cH2GKMO\u201d (an abbreviation of Grande\u2019s favorite saying, \u201cHonest to God, knock me out\u201d) on their thumbs \u2014 which they got after getting engaged in June. Grande, however, has since covered the word with a feather.\n\nImage zoom Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson Paul Zimmerman/WireImage\n\nRELATED: Pete Davidson Gets a Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s-Inspired Neck Tattoo to Match Fianc\u00e9e Ariana Grande\n\nAfter ending their engagement, Davidson joked about his tattoos in his former fianc\u00e9e\u2019s honor.\n\n\u201cWhat else is going on? Um, I\u2019ve been covering a bunch of tattoos, that\u2019s fun. I\u2019m f\u2014 zero for two in the tattoo [department],\u201d he remarked at a comedy benefit show alongside Judd Apatow.\n\nHis comment referenced the fact that before his relationship with Grande, he got ex-girlfriend Cazzie David\u2019s face inked on his arm. That tattoo has also since been covered.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m afraid to get my mom tattooed on me, that\u2019s how bad it is,\u201d he joked during his routine.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson\u2019s Loved Ones \u2018Are Relieved\u2019 They Broke Up: Source\n\nOnce Apatow joined Davidson onstage, the SNL star revealed that even his friends had come to agree with all the critics who spoke out against the couple\u2019s decision to get matching tattoos.\n\n\u201cSo, obviously you know I, we [Ariana] broke up or whatever, but when me and her first got engaged we got tattoos,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it was like in a magazine like, was Pete Davidson stupid? And 93 percent of it said yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo my boy, he was like, \u2018Don\u2019t listen to that s\u2014 man. They\u2019re literally f\u2014 haters,'\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah f\u2014 that.
