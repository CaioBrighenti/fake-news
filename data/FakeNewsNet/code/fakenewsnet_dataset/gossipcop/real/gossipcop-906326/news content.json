Netflix\n\nAn interview with \"Master of None\" co-creator Lena Waithe in UK newspaper The Independent in March 2018 suggested that Ansari is the reluctant party when it comes to producing more seasons of the show.\n\n\"I mean, I talk to Aziz\u2026but it's the last thing that ever comes up in our conversations,\" Waithe said.\n\nNetflix did not cancel the show or remove Ansari from the project in response to the article.\n\nAnsari is a creator of the show as well as playing its main character. He won a Golden Globe in 2018 for the role in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Musical or Comedy category. He also won an Emmy for the show in 2016 for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.\n\nAnsari previously released a statement about the accusation. Ansari said that sexual activity had occurred but that he thought it was \"completely consensual.\" He said the broader #MeToo movement, in which people share their experience with sexual assault, was \"long overdue,\" but did not consider this encounter an example of it.\n\nAnsari used the statement to outline what he thought had happened on the date: \"The next day, I got a text from her saying that although 'it may have seemed okay,' upon further reflection, she felt uncomfortable.\n\n\"It was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was surprised and concerned.\n\n\"I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said,\" he said.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a5e3959f42149ea008b517e-2732-1366.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5b5edc0d79126d1e008b47c9-750-375.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a5e3959f42149ea008b517e-2732-1366.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-says-aziz-ansari-is-welcome-back-after-sexual-misconduct-allegation-2018-7", "title": "Netflix says it wants Aziz Ansari to start making shows again, 6 months after he was controversially accused of sexual misconduct", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-07-30", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-30", "news_keywords": "News UK, Aziz Ansari, Netflix, Sin\u00e9ad Baker", "sailthru.tags": "News UK, Aziz Ansari, Netflix, Sin\u00e9ad Baker", "description": "A woman accused comedian Aziz Ansari of continually trying to have sex with her in September even though she gave \"cues\" to indicate how \"uncomfortable and distressed\" she was.
