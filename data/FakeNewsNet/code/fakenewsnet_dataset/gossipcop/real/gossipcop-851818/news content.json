Kennedy International Airport. He initially stored the cake in the overhead bin, but he said he moved it down when asked to do so by a flight attendant. Burke said he and his family were asked to leave the plane after a second attendant told him off, and Burke questioned whether the attendant had been drinking.\n\n\u201cShe said I was being non-compliant,\u201d Burke told Daily News. \u201cI said, \u2018Miss, have you been drinking?\u2019 Because her behavior was irrational and she stormed off.\u201d\n\nJetBlue confirmed the incident to Daily News, but said the removal was justified because the passengers\u2019 \u201cbehavior demonstrated a risk for additional escalation in air.\u201d The company also said that the passengers cursed and shouted at the crew and \u201crefused to speak with a team leader about the situation.\u201d", "images":
