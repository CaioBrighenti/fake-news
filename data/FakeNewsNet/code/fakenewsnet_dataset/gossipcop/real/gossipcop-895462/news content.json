The dashing, ginger-haired royal has jetted around the globe for years to represent his family at charitable events. He\u2019s been admired by many for his convictions to worthy causes. It was only a matter of time for the prince to meet his match in Meghan Markle, another successful socialite devoted to philanthropy.\n\nWhile each half of the couple is financially set in their own right, Prince Harry is said to be worth $40 million \u2013 which is only a fraction of his family\u2019s worth, including palaces, jewels, and artwork. Once they have tied the knot, however, the prince is unlikely to share his royal fortune with his American bride for one surprising reason. It has to do with her nationality. Here we\u2019ll take a look at the factors involved.\n\nMarkle will become a British citizen\n\nThe citizenship process takes 3 years.\n\nWhen the couple\u2019s engagement was announced in December 2017, it was revealed Markle would become a British citizen. This process will likely take about three years. \u201cShe intends to become a U.K. citizen and will go through the process of that, which some of you know takes a number of years,\u201d said Prince Harry\u2019s communications secretary, Jason Knauf. \u201cShe will retain her U.S. citizenship through that process.\u201d\n\nIt has not yet been revealed whether Markle will ultimately give up her American citizenship or maintain a dual nationality status.\n\nNext: The U.S. taxes its citizens living abroad.\n\nThe U.S. taxes Markle\u2019s income\n\nSome of her $50,000-per-episode salary goes to Uncle Sam.\n\nWhile she remains a U.S. citizen, Markle\u2019s income will continue to be taxed by Uncle Sam. Much of this income currently comes from her USA Network show Suits. It was revealed in November 2017 Markle would leave the popular legal drama at the end of Season 7. (The second half of that season is set to air in 2018.) Markle reportedly earns more than $50,000 per episode of Suits. Her estimated yearly income is $450,000, which also includes around $80,000 in endorsement money, according to knownetworth.com.\n\nNext: Prince Harry inherited millions.\n\nPrince Harry inherited half his mom\u2019s millions\n\nThe two princes inherited $29.2 million from Princess Diana.\n\nWhen Princess Diana died in 1997, Prince Harry inherited half of her estate, which was worth about $29.2 million. He also shares a $4.7 million annual allowance with his brother and sister-in-law, Prince William and Kate Middleton. Taking that into account along with the rest of the royal family\u2019s worth, Markle is about to marry into a fortune.\n\nNext: How the U.S. could get richer off the marriage\n\nUncle Sam would tax Markle\u2019s royal money\n\nThe U.S. would want a piece of the royal pie.\n\nIf Markle receives any money from the royal family, she may need to pay U.S. income taxes on it. \u201cIf she receives money from her husband or his family, and that\u2019s considered income, she would have to pay income tax on that,\u201d royal expert Marlene Koenig told The Sun.\n\nInterestingly, if the couple were to marry and then live in the United States, Prince Harry wouldn\u2019t be expected to file taxes in Britain. The U.S. system of taxing its citizens abroad is unusual. It originated during the Civil War to punish men who fled the country to avoid fighting in the war.\n\nNext: Well-kept secrets could be revealed.\n\nRoyal family secrets would be revealed\n\nInformation on royal finances could go public.\n\nOther than the royal pain of owing British money to the United States, Prince Harry and his family could take another hit. If Markle reports income from the royal family to the IRS, she would have to divulge details about the royal family\u2019s estate on her tax forms. The family\u2019s finances have long been \u201cimpenetrable\u201d to others, according to David McClure, author of Royal Legacy: How the Royal Family Have Made, Spent and Passed on Their Wealth.\n\n\u201cYou can be sure that those at Buckingham Palace and those who run the accounts are looking very carefully at all of this to make sure that the royal family\u2019s money does not get reported to the IRS!\u201d royal expert Koenig said.\n\nNext: The royal family\u2019s net worth\n\nHow much the royal family is worth\n\nRoyal family net worth: $88 billion\n\nSince the royal family has kept its money details under lock and key, it\u2019s impossible to estimate the family\u2019s net worth with 100% certainty. However, the most recent royal family net worth estimate was to the tune of a whopping $88 billion. Around $33 billion of that is made up from Buckingham Palace, the royal art collection, crown jewels, and the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall.\n\nAs accurate as that number may be, it\u2019s still speculation, and the Royals will surely want to continue to guard their wealth secrets closely.\n\nNext: Meghan Markle\u2019s personal net worth\n\nHow much Meghan Markle is worth\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s net worth: $7 million\n\nIf Prince Harry chooses to avoid the tax hassle by not sharing any royal family money with Markle for three years, she would likely get by just fine. Markle\u2019s personal net worth is reported as $7 million by knownetworth.com. Other than her income from Suits and endorsements, she has also brought in almost $400,000 from three movies in which she appeared. She also worked as a freelance calligrapher for income during her early acting days.\n\nNext: A massive boost for the economy\n\nA $680 million royal boost\n\nThe wedding could boost the UK economy by $680 million.\n\nMarkle joining the royal family won\u2019t mean all financial headaches. The couple\u2019s May 19 wedding will reportedly boost the U.K. economy $680 million, according to Reuters. The report attributed $500 million of that to tourism, travel, and hotels. In addition, $67 million is predicted from the sale of commemorative items like T-shirts and hats. Commoners celebrating the royal wedding are expected to spend more than $200 million throwing parties.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-898515150.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-on-TV.png?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-engagement-photo-e1514400474670.png?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-495597362.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/buckingham-palace-aerial.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Princess-Diana-on-VJ-Day-in-1995.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/uncle-sam.png?x46112", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-898515150.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-with-the-roya-family.jpg?x46112"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-898515150.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Bennett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/one-surprising-reason-prince-harry-shouldnt-share-his-royal-fortune-with-meghan-markle.html/", "title": "Why Prince Harry Shouldn\u2019t Share His Royal Fortune With Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/one-surprising-reason-prince-harry-shouldnt-share-his-royal-fortune-with-meghan-markle.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "There\u2019s one reason why Prince Harry shouldn\u2019t share his royal fortune with his bride-to-be, American actress Meghan Markle.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why Prince Harry Shouldn\u2019t Share His Royal Fortune With Meghan Markle", "description": "There\u2019s one reason why Prince Harry shouldn\u2019t share his royal fortune with his bride-to-be, American actress Meghan Markle.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/one-surprising-reason-prince-harry-shouldnt-share-his-royal-fortune-with-meghan-markle.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "updated_time": "2018-05-22T23:56:04+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-898515150.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-898515150.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wallstcheatsheet", "tag": "Royal Wedding", "section": "Money & Career", "published_time": "2018-05-22T23:56:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-22T23:56:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "There\u2019s one reason why Prince Harry shouldn\u2019t share his royal fortune with his bride-to-be, American actress Meghan Markle.", "title": "Why Prince Harry Shouldn\u2019t Share His Royal Fortune With Meghan Markle", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-898515150.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "position": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527033360.0, "source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
