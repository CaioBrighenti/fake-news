Normally I would do this with a drill, but I didn\u2019t bring my Makita with me.\u201d\n\nThe party then moved through the Square to tour Harvard Yard. Rudd then received his Pudding Pot tonight at the closing ceremony, where he was roasted by the club members and participated in their latest show, \u201cIntermission Impossible,\u201d the company\u2019s 170th production.\n\n\u201cThe whole day has been a blast,\u201d Rudd said during the press conference that followed the roast. \u201cIt\u2019s been great getting to see Harvard. I\u2019ve never been here before. It was so profound to walk through the Yard and learn about the history. I\u2019m a bit of a history buff, and to be here \u2026 was very moving.\u201d\n\nThe big question of Rudd was who he was rooting for in the Super Bowl on Sunday. Without hesitation, Rudd emphatically responded: \u201cI\u2019m rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles. The Belichick/Brady combo is the greatest ever, but I\u2019m sick of seeing the Patriots win.\u201d\n\nWhen asked which of his film characters he most identified with, Rudd said, \u201cI think my character in \u201cI Love You, Man\u201d because he had that kind of insecurity that sometimes makes you say dumb things in certain situations \u2014 [such as] you\u2019re rooting for the Eagles over the Patriots when you\u2019re in Boston.\u201d", "images": ["https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_tour_310.jpg", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Satish-raindrops.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iStock-dragana991-Burnout.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/013018_seas_convocation_0005_2500.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Hong_Kong_2500.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_roast_0559.jpg?w=1024", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/iStock-dragana991-Burnout.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_roast_1728.jpg", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_roast_1546.jpg?w=945", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_tour_102.jpg?w=1024", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/013018_seas_convocation_0005_2500.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_roast_1546.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DeloriaPhilCopyWv5-17072.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/012518_woy_ks_010__2500.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/snowballthumbnail-1.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_roast_0816.jpg?w=1024", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_tour_023.jpg?w=1024", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/matthew-bennett-78hTqvjYMS4-unsplash2500.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jamieleecurtis_2000_hp_archives_2500.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_roast_1546.jpg?w=945", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aaron Goldman", "John Michael Baglione", "Harvard Correspondents"], "canonical_link": "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/02/moy-2018/", "title": "Paul Rudd honored as Hasty Pudding\u2019s Man of the Year", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "description": "Paul Rudd, a staple of comedic cinema for the past 25 years, was recognized as Hasty Pudding Theatricals\u2019 2018 Man of the Year on Feb. 2.", "theme-color": "#a51c30", "fb": {"app_id": 135898969862440}, "twitter": {"site": "@harvard", "creator": "@harvard", "title": "Paul Rudd honored as Hasty Pudding\u2019s Man of the Year", "description": "Paul Rudd, a staple of comedic cinema for the past 25 years, was recognized as Hasty Pudding Theatricals\u2019 2018 Man of the Year on Feb. 2.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_roast_1546.jpg?w=945"}}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Harvard Gazette", "title": "Paul Rudd honored as Hasty Pudding\u2019s Man of the Year", "type": "article", "url": "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/02/moy-2018/", "description": "Paul Rudd, a staple of comedic cinema for the past 25 years, was recognized as Hasty Pudding Theatricals\u2019 2018 Man of the Year on Feb. 2.", "image": {"identifier": "https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/020218_hasty_roast_1546.jpg?w=945", "width": 945, "height": 630}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-02T16:30:08-0400", "modified_time": "2018-02-07T08:47:53-0400", "section": "Campus & Community", "tag": "2018 Man of the Year, Hasty Pudding Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, Man of the Year, Paul Rudd, Pudding Pot, Radcliffe Pitches"}, "news_keywords": "2018 Man of the Year, Hasty Pudding Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, Man of the Year, Paul Rudd, Pudding Pot, Radcliffe Pitches"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517603408.0, "source": "https://news.harvard.edu", "summary": ""}
