A rep for Tina did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nCraig is the son of Tina \u2014 who was just 18 when she gave birth to him \u2014 and saxophonist Raymond Hill, who performed with Ike Turner\u2019s band Kings of Rhythm.

I didn\u2019t want my children to hear.\u201d\n\nThe singer recently launched a musical based on her life, Tina, in London \u2014 which details every turbulent moment of her 50-year singing
