My mom, sisters & I will be donating $500,000 to @redcross and @salvationarmyus today #HoustonStrong \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) August 29, 2017\n\nMy sisters, mom and I accept your challenge Kev! We will be donating $500 thousand to @redcross and @salvationarmyus today #HoustonStrong https://t.co/f8iurk8dNX \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) August 29, 2017", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/kardashian-family-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/kardashian-family-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colin Stutz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/7949007/kardashians-donating-500000-hurricane-harvey-relief", "title": "Kardashian Family Donating $500,000 to Hurricane Harvey Relief Efforts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Kardashian Family Donating $500,000 to Hurricane Harvey Relief", "description": "As rain continues to pour down on southeast Texas and the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey -- now a tropical storm -- becomes more clear, the Kardashian family is stepping up to join the ranks of celebrities supporting flood relief in the region.", "og": {"title": "Kardashian Family Donating $500,000 to Hurricane Harvey Relief Efforts", "description": "As rain continues to pour down on southeast Texas and the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey -- now a tropical storm -- becomes more clear, the Kardashian family is stepping up to join the ranks of celebrities supporting flood relief in the region.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/kardashian-family-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/7949007/kardashians-donating-500000-hurricane-harvey-relief", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/7949007/kardashians-donating-500000-hurricane-harvey-relief", "title": "Kardashian Family Donating $500,000 to Hurricane Harvey Relief Efforts", "description": "As rain continues to pour down on southeast Texas and the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey -- now a tropical storm -- becomes more clear, the Kardashian family is stepping up to join the ranks of celebrities supporting flood relief in the region.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/kardashian-family-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
