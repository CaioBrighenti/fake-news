The rapper publicly said he had contemplated committing suicide in 2010.\n\n\u201cThe most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest/Today I seriously thought about killing you/I contemplated, premeditated murder/And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so.\u201d\n\nYikes\n\nWest references his opioid addiction after getting liposuction and confirms he has bipolar disorder.\n\n\u201cI can feel the spirits all around me/I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me/They know I got demons all on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my bipolar s***, n**** what/That\u2019s my superpower, n**** ain\u2019t no disability/I\u2019m a superhero! I\u2019m a superhero!\u201d\n\nAll Mine\n\nThe star references his sister-in-law Khloe Kardashian and boyfriend Tristan Thompson\u2019s cheating scandal. Thompson cheated on a then pregnant Kardashian, and it turned into a media frenzy.\n\n\u201cAll these thots on Christian Mingle/Almost what got Tristan single.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t Leave\n\nThe Kardashians are known for the way they handle themselves publicly. They do major PR damage control, and West references his wife Kim Kardashian-West\u2019s reaction to the comments he made about slavery during a TMZ interview.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Slavery a choice.\u2019 They say, \u2018How, Ye?\u2019/Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWife calling screaming saying we\u2019re about to lose it all/I had to calm her down cause she couldn\u2019t breathe/I told her she could leave me now but she wouldn\u2019t leave.\u201d\n\nNo Mistakes\n\nKanye had to drop out of his Saint Pablo Tour in 2016, and was hospitalized after a psychological breakdown.\n\n\u201cOh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard/I had dead on my books, it\u2019s been a shaky a** year.\u201d\n\nViolent Crimes\n\nThe song writer references his fears about raising daughters, and the way they\u2019ll grow up in our society. He also references one of his favorite movies, Meet the Fockers.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do no yoga, don\u2019t do pilates/Just play piano and stick to karate/I pray your body\u2019s draped more like mine and not like your mommy\u2019s\u201d\n\n\u201cMatter of fact Marlin, this ain\u2019t Meet the Fockers/I\u2019ll beat his a**, pray I beat the charges.\u201d", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/bustle.png?resize=2560%2C1440&ssl=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/AdobeStock_88936309-1.jpeg?w=2560&h=1440&crop=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/05/Yourphx-Logo-2018.png", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/06/fb-2.jpg?w=75&h=77&crop=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2018/06/Kanye20West2C20201520MTV20Video20Music20Awards_25614989_ver1.0-1.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/AdobeStock_242909118.jpeg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/AdobeStock_88936309-1.jpeg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/05/SCAM-720x40520_OP_stretched_CP__1559250196256.jpg_89928290_ver1.0.jpg?resize=2560%2C1440&ssl=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/Arizona-Rattlers.png?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/Pet-Sematary-720x405.jpg?w=720", "https://i2.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/Arizona-Rattlers.png?w=2000&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/Arizona-Rattlers.png?resize=2560%2C1440&ssl=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/06/30DL_1536335780687_54534065_ver1.0.jpg?w=1140", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/themes/nexstar/client/src/images/footer/nexstar-logo-white-nmg.png", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/06/ig-e1561483181687.jpg?w=77&h=76&crop=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/themes/nexstar/client/src/images/footer/app-stores/appstore_footer.png", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/themes/nexstar/client/src/images/footer/app-stores/googleplay_footer.png", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/themes/nexstar/client/src/images/footer/social/instagram.png", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/AdobeStock_242909118.jpeg?w=2560&h=1440&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2017/06/30dl-pic_1553878613627_79714832_ver1.0.jpg?resize=2560%2C1440&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2017/09/PA20Dont20Miss20720x405_1554226063668.jpg_80294483_ver1.0.jpg?resize=2560%2C1440&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/AdobeStock_88936309-1.jpeg?w=2000&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2018/06/Kanye20West2C20201520MTV20Video20Music20Awards_25614989_ver1.0-1.jpg?resize=2560%2C1440&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/05/Picture1_1558024656100_87807161_ver1.0.jpg?resize=2560%2C1440&ssl=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/07/bustle.png?w=600&h=405&crop=1", "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2019/06/tw-1.jpg?w=75&h=75&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.yourphx.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/102/2018/06/Kanye20West2C20201520MTV20Video20Music20Awards_25614989_ver1.0-1.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Lozano", "Caitlynn Mcdaniel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yourphx.com/news/decoding-kanye-wests-ye-lyrics/", "title": "Decoding Kanye West\u2019s \u2018Ye\u2019 Lyrics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "All hail Yeezus.", "keywords": "AS SEEN ON TV CATEGORY DEFAULT STORY TEMPLATE -
