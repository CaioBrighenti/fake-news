Serena Williams and her fianc\u00e9, Alexis Ohanian, are waiting to learn the sex of their baby, the tennis champ revealed at the 2017 Met Gala on Monday, May 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re waiting. [It\u2019s] a surprise,\u201d Williams, 35, told Vogue\u2018s Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. \u201cWe call it \u2018baby.'\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the couple, who announced their engagement last December, are trying to figure out living arrangements. \u201cThat\u2019s the question of the hour,\u201d the athlete told Talley when asked if she\u2019ll relocate to Ohanian\u2019s current home in San Francisco. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be stuck in a more beautiful place.\u201d\n\nOne thing that Williams and the Reddit cofounder, 34, definitely agree on is their excitement to become first-time parents. \u201cI\u2019m really good,\u201d Ohanian gushed. Williams agreed, adding that she and her man \u201chave time\u201d to prepare for the arrival of their baby this fall.\n\nThe Met Gala was the Olympic gold medalist\u2019s first red carpet appearance since announcing her pregnancy on April 19. She looked stunning in a formfitting, green Versace dress, while Ohanian rocked a black tuxedo.\n\nWilliams revealed at an April 25 TED conference in Vancouver that she announced her pregnancy on Snapchat by mistake. \u201cI was on vacation, taking time for myself, and I have this thing where I\u2019ve been checking my status and taking a picture every week,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been just saving it, but you know how social media is \u2014 you press the wrong button \u2026 and 30 minutes later, I\u2019d missed four calls. So I picked it up and realized, \u2018Oh no.'\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
