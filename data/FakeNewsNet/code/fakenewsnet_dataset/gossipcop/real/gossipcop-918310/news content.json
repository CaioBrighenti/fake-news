{"url": "https://www.allure.com/gallery/oscars-2018-best-hair-and-makeup-looks", "text": "The 2018 awards season was a season for beauty. We saw stars taking more risks and having more fun with their hair and makeup than we've seen in a long time. And the 90th Academy Awards was no different. Sure, per usual we saw a lot of subdued makeup \u2014 soft pink lips, champagne-tinged lids, a touch of blush \u2014 but that's to be expected at an evening that's so important for these stars. The thing is, even with people playing it safer, we did see stars taking risks: There were fierce wings (Lupita Nyong'o, Jennifer Lawrence), vampy lip colors (Salma Hayek, Gal Gadot), major haircuts (Margot Robbie, Saorsie Ronan), and more amazing and creative hairstyles than ever before (Lupita, we're looking at you again). Below, you can see them all in our roundup of the best beauty looks of Oscar night.", "images":
