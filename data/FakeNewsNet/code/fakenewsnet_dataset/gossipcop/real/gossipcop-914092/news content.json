This year is no different.\n\nRoutine is built into royal life, especially for senior royals such as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles the Prince of Wales, whose busy schedules are usually laid out for them months or years in advance.\n\nEach royal year has a certain rhythm: Easter at Windsor Castle, Trooping the Colour and Royal Ascot in June, the annual eight-week holiday at Balmoral in Scotland in late summer, Remembrance Day in November, and Christmas always at Sandringham House.\n\nSandringham:\n\nFor the past three decades, the queen has hosted her sprawling family at her private estate in Norfolk for the Christmas and New Year holidays. There they exchange cheap gag gifts and sit down to a black-tie Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve.\n\nOn Christmas morning, they have breakfast (the men go downstairs for a hearty \"fry up,\" the women have something light served in their rooms, according to former royal chef Darren McGrady), then gather before 11 a.m. local time to walk to services at nearby St. Mary Magdalene Church. They return for Christmas lunch and then gather around the TV to watch the queen's annual Christmas speech to the nation and the Commonwealth.\n\n(This is required watching for the family as it is the only speech the queen gets to write herself without involvement from the government of the day. It used to be broadcast from Sandringham, starting with her grandfather in 1936, but now she usually records it ahead of time.)\n\nA clutch of British royals, led by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla Duchess of Cornwall, walk to attend a Christmas service in Sandringham, Dec. 25, 2016.

Unlike Windsor, it's about two hours away by train from London and the media, although there is always an organized photo shoot of the family walking to their little church, even Prince Philip, 97. But not the queen; she is usually driven to church.\n\nMost important, Sandringham is much-loved by the queen and her family, including her father and grandfather, both of whom died there.\n\nLast year, Prince Harry and his then-fiancee, Meghan Markle, were among the walkers \u2013an unprecedented honor for her since she had not yet officially joined the family, their May wedding still months away.\n\nSandringham estate is sprawling (20,000 acres) so it's suitable for the annual Boxing Day (Dec. 26) pheasant shoot that Philip used to be in charge of organizing, although now that he's finally retired from public life, he may have passed that task on to someone else.\n\nLast year, Harry skipped the shoot, reportedly to spare Meghan's animal-rights sympathies, and he may be absent again this year. Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana, also loathed blood sports but from boyhood on, her sons have joined in enthusiastically with their royal relations.\n\nPrince William and Duchess Kate and their children, baby Prince Louis, Princess Charlotte and Prince George, pose for their annual Christmas card at their country home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk in the fall of 2018.

This year, when they are expecting their first child in the spring, they are going to be at Sandringham alongside Will and Kate, despite all the tabloid rumor-mongering about alleged tensions between the brothers and their wives.\n\nSometimes Will and Harry play in a charity soccer match on Christmas Eve, pitting Sandringham staff and estate neighbors.\n\nWill and Kate take Christmas cheer to military families:\n\nThe Cambridges went all the way to Cyprus to say Merry Christmas to Royal Air Force families. First, on Dec. 4, they hosted a holiday party at Kensington Palace for families whose loved ones are serving at a British base on the island.\n\nDuchess Kate of Cambridge meets children at Kensington Palace where she and Prince William hosted a Christmas party for families and children of Royal Air Force personnel serving on Cyprus, Dec. 4, 2018. (Photo: Richard Pohle/ AP)\n\nThey collected gifts and letters from the children and the next day hopped on a plane to deliver them to the men and women based at RAF Akrotiri, where they attended another Christmas party for troops who will be apart from their families throughout the holiday season.\n\nKensington Palace's Twitter account quickly filled up with tweets documenting the fun and laughs had by all at both parties.\n\nYesterday The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge hosted a Christmas Party at Kensington Palace, supported by @PoppyLegion, for families and children of deployed personnel from @RAFCGY and @RAFMarhamMedia serving in Cyprus. pic.twitter.com/MrrQIj4uz6 \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) December 5, 2018\n\nThe following week, the royal pair visited the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, for which Kate is the new royal patron, and the homeless resource center The Passage, where they visited with children and staff in settings decorated for Christmas.\n\nIn past years, Kate has also attended the annual Christmas party at one of her older patronages, the Anna Freud National Center for Children and Families, a child mental health research, training and treatment center in London.\n\nDuchess Meghan's Christmas appearance\n\nIn keeping with her former career as an actress (USA's \"Suits\"), she made a solo visit to the Royal Variety Charity\u2019s residential nursing and care home, Brinsworth House in London, on Tuesday to bring holiday cheer to three dozen residents, including singing carols around a Christmas tree.\n\nPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan of Sussex watch fireworks at their wedding reception at Frogmore House, Windsor, on May 19, 2018.

Every year in early December she hosts a children's lunch party at Clarence House in London where the kids help her decorate the palace Christmas tree.\n\n\u201cThe tree decorating for me is always the start of Christmas,\" she told reporters the day of the Dec. 6 party this year. \"I haven\u2019t thought about it before today, but I come in and see the tree and the children and everything and it just gets me in a Christmas mood.\"\n\nDuchess Camilla of Cornwall meets reindeer Dancer, left, and Blitzen, right, with their handlers Karen and Jason Perrins in the gardens at Clarence House in London, Dec. 6, 2018. (Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP)\n\nThis year, she took some of the kids outside to meet two reindeer, \"Dancer\" and \"Blitzen,\" and their handler elves, leading to cute pictures of them all feeding lichen to the not-so-tiny antlered critters.\n\nFor the past nine years, the kids and families invited to Camilla's party have been beneficiaries of the Helen & Douglas House hospice center and Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity, two organizations for which Camilla serves as patron. Every year the organizations help support thousands of children who suffer from chronic illnesses.\n\nThe queen's Christmas lunch:\n\nThe week before Christmas, the queen hosts a huge festive lunch for her extended family at Buckingham Palace, including those who will not be at Sandringham. This gives the monarch an opportunity to catch up with relatives she might not see regularly during the year.\n\nLast year, Meghan Markle was included, in another sign of how quickly she was accepted into the family ahead of the wedding. Tradition reportedly dictates that the lunch is attended by only relatives and spouses.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 19, Meghan was photographed smiling next to Harry as the two drove onto the palace grounds for this year's luncheon. She sported large diamond studs and what appeared to be a top with a high collar.\n\nPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan arrive at the annual Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in London on Dec. 19, 2018.

Photographers also captured Prince George peeking through the backseat.\n\nPrince William, Duchess Kate and their son Prince George arrive at the queen's Christmas lunch.

Their routine was interrupted (a rarity) in 2016 when, the day after the lunch, Buckingham Palace suddenly announced they had postponed their departure because the two had \"heavy colds.\" They were flown there by helicopter the next day.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II poses at her desk in the 1844 Room at Buckingham Palace, on Dec. 13, 2017, after recording her Christmas Day broadcast to the nation and the Commonwealth.

This year, Charles and Camilla posed on a garden bench at Clarence House, their London home. The Cambridges posed in the branches of a tree in the garden at Anmer Hall.\n\nAnd Harry and Meghan chose a previously unseen black and white photo of themselves watching the fireworks at Frogmore House after their second wedding reception to adorn their 2018 card.\n\nBut it's the card from the queen that counts. Every year, she and Prince Philip send around 750, usually featuring a family photo, to family, friends and members of the Royal Household staff, along with others such as British and Commonwealth prime ministers, governors-general and high commissioners.\n\nPrince Philip usually sends another 200 cards to different regiments and organizations with whom he's long been associated.\n\nThe Royal Christmas Gifts:\n\nAll members of the Royal Household receive presents from the queen, who personally hands them out to some members of her household staff at Buckingham Palace and at Windsor Castle.\n\nPrince Charles and Duchess Camilla pose on the grounds of Clarence House, London, for their 2018 Christmas card. (Photo: Hugo Burnand/Clarence House via AP)\n\nThe Royal Christmas Puddings:\n\nContinuing the tradition from her father, King George VI, and her grandfather, George V, the queen also gives out about 1,500 Christmas puddings to her staff in the palaces, in the Court Post Office and the palace police. Each pudding is accompanied by a greeting card from the queen and Prince Philip.\n\nAmericans are familiar with \"pudding\" as a custard treat. A British Christmas pudding, also known as a \"plum pudding\" or a \"figgy pudding,\" is nothing like that. It's a medieval soft cake-like dessert made of dried fruits held together by egg, suet, treacle or molasses, and flavored with spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.\n\nThe Royal Christmas Trees:\n\nThe tradition of decorating trees at Christmas was popularized by British royals, specifically Queen Victoria and her German-born husband Prince Albert, both of whom had grown up with the custom. Her German ancestors introduced the idea to the English and her German mother continued it. By the 1860s it was a thing, with hundreds of trees being sold in Covent Garden.\n\nAs well as donating money to several charities in Windsor each Christmas, the queen also gives Christmas trees to Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, St. Giles' Cathedral and the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh. Churches and schools in the Sandringham area will also receive a tree from Her Majesty.\n\nDecorated trees go up at the London palaces, and at Sandringham there's a large silver artificial tree in the dining room decorated by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren, according to former royal chef McGrady, who dished about the tradition in an interview with Good Housekeeping.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/12/19/royal-christmas-queen-harry-meghan-and-kate-celebrate-family-traditions/2281611002/", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/19/USAT/9d04ea58-6786-45ca-8dce-3a2d55bfccc7-EPA_BRITAIN_ROYALTY_4.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/12/USAT/cdfe0513-946f-435c-bc79-ad7800b2b444-Anmer_Hall.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-nav-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/12/USAT/2f514a1d-d288-4231-8376-dc11b5a2f8f2-AFP_AFP_VF1TD.JPG?width=534&height=401&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/12/USAT/075f376f-7529-4c68-bc90-136833b20e79-AFP_AFP_VF031.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/14/USAT/5fe2c55c-12f5-43b7-9a41-391a7d85ccdb-AP_Britain_Royals_Christmas.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/12/USAT/3f7e1420-5818-4127-8f74-804b0fe80bdd-AP_APTOPIX_Britain_Queens_Christmas.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/12/USAT/2f514a1d-d288-4231-8376-dc11b5a2f8f2-AFP_AFP_VF1TD.JPG?crop=2186,1230,x0,y34&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/14/USAT/334e06d7-cbaa-43d7-87d4-9cf170b4d53d-EPA_BRITAIN_ROYALTY_CHRISTMAS_CARD.JPG?width=180&height=240&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/12/USAT/2b764fe8-4bd2-4e64-8aba-1b19abe0f36a-AP_Britain_Royals.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-masthead-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/14/USAT/f669ae95-b612-4d00-a493-9189ab8d78da-AFP_AFP_1BL6XF.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/12/USAT/6e9aa107-3c8e-4e41-840c-7399c3ad4f34-AP_Britain_Royal.2.jpg?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5006.0.0/images/indicators/facebook-loading.gif", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/19/USAT/7e14f7a4-faed-4334-a72d-4ac2e85945a9-EPA_BRITAIN_ROYALTY_6.JPG?width=540&height=&fit=bounds&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/12/USAT/2f514a1d-d288-4231-8376-dc11b5a2f8f2-AFP_AFP_VF1TD.JPG?crop=2186,1230,x0,y34&width=3200&height=1680&fit=bounds", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Puente", "Published A.M.
