I think it's a wonderful thing and, if anything, I want women to understand their own sexuality outside of a patriarchal male gaze. We're the core of sexual beings, and I think that's something that should be celebrated rather than attacked.\"\n\nAnd the brunette beauty credits actress Emma Watson with shaping her idea of feminism, and making her realise the movement is a \"choice\".\n\nShe added: \"To start saying that certain people need to have a license to be feminist is insane. Emma Watson said feminism isn't some kind of tool to beat other women with, it's supposed to be a freedom of choice.\"\n\nThe 'We Are Your Friends' actress believes that for women in Hollywood, there is a need to \"prove\" themselves to be \"dynamic\", as she claims her ultimate goal is to stop being cast as the 'hot girl' and become a more versatile actress.\n\nSpeaking to the August issue of Glamour UK magazine, Emily said: \"That's basically my strategy...and part of the reason I'm so grateful I have modelling and so many other things that I'm doing - because if I didn't have other ways of making money, I'd be like, 'OK, I guess I'm doing the bathing-suit-girl role.' You really have to prove yourself in this industry and I'm very much up for the challenge. It takes a really long time to not only prove yourself, but also prove that you're more dynamic than just this one part of you that they see.\"", "images": ["https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7405050-emily-ratajkowski-women-should-celebrate-sexuality/", "title": "Emily Ratajkowski: Women should 'celebrate' sexuality", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 200654546635181}, "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Emily Ratajkowski wants women to", "og": {"title": "Emily Ratajkowski: Women should 'celebrate' sexuality", "url": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7405050-emily-ratajkowski-women-should-celebrate-sexuality/", "description": "Emily Ratajkowski wants women to \\", "type": "Article", "site_name": "BramptonGuardian.com", "image": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png"}, "article": {"section": "WhatsOn-Celebrity", "published_time": "2017-07-04T10:00:06Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-04T10:19:21Z"}, "parsely-title": "Emily Ratajkowski: Women should 'celebrate' sexuality", "parsely-link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7405050-emily-ratajkowski-women-should-celebrate-sexuality/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "http://media.zuza.com/f/0/f0d3abb7-13b2-46f8-8788-604eae7cf268/BS2BS1383519_Image1_Thumbnail.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-07-04T10:00:06Z", "parsely-section": "whatson|celebrity", "parsely-tags": "subcategory:whatson|celebrity,category:whatson,news_source:bangshowbiz,primary_publication:bramptonguardian,video:no,images:1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Communities/bramptonguardian/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499162406.0, "source": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com", "summary": ""}
