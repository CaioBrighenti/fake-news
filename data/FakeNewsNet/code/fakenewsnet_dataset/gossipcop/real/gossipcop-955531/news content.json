Baskin-Robbins\n\nFeel like indulging this weekend? It\u2019s a good time to do it.\n\nBetween National Ice Cream Day and National Fry Day, there are some free food deals and a few creative foodie inventions happening in the Valley this weekend.\n\nFirst, Friday is National Fry Day (get it?). It\u2019s also Friday the 13th and the first-ever National Beef Tallow Day (which is sometimes used in frying french fries).\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is giving away free medium fries on Friday \u2013 and every Friday through Dec. 30 \u2013 with a $1 purchase. You must download the McDonald\u2019s app to get them.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to The Fresno Bee content across all your devices. SAVE NOW\n\nFarmer Boys restaurants are giving away a free order of fries with the purchase of a burger (excluding kids burgers). Farmer Boys has a restaurant at 745 Herndon Ave. in Clovis, along with locations in Hanford and Tulare.\n\nWayback Burgers restaurants in Firebaugh and Chowchilla are giving away free bottomless fries when you buy any burger or sandwich Friday.\n\nSunday is National Ice Cream Day.\n\nYogurtland locations are celebrating National Ice Cream Day, which may seem odd as they sell frozen yogurt, but Yogurtland has recently added ice cream.\n\nBetween 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. Sunday, Yogurtland is offering a buy one, get one free deal. In addition to its lineup of yogurt, Yogurtland will have ice cream in these flavors: chocolate, vanilla, chocolate malt ball with Whoppers, light butter pecan and Oreo cookies and cream.\n\nYogurtland has locations at River Park, The Square at Campus Pointe near Fresno State and at 2045 S. Mooney Blvd. in Visalia.\n\nBaskin-Robbins has a slew of things going Sunday, including the launch of its new \u201cfreak shakes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThese \"freak shakes\" are available from Baskin Robbins starting Sunday, July 15.\n\nThey include a unicorn freak shake, a milkshake topped with cotton candy and cotton candy-flavored ice cream, sugar cone and a strip of Airheads rainbow sour candy strip.\n\nOther milkshakes include a Jamoca almond fudge shake topped with doughnut holes, an Oreo shake topped with a slice of Oreo cookies and cream Polar Pizza (which is kind of like a cookie with lots of yummy stuff on it).\n\nThe freak shakes are not free, however. But you can get other things for free.\n\nCustomers who download the Baskin-Robbins app will receive offers Sunday like a buy one, get one free cone, a buy one, get one free 99 cent sundae and $2 off a milkshake.\n\nFosters Freeze is selling its old fashioned dipped cones for 72 cents Sunday. The restaurant has five locations in Fresno and many others across the Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmpersand Ice Cream will celebrate National Ice Cream Day Sunday, not with freebies but with new flavors. The owners had their staffers give them a wish list of flavors and they will have eight of them for sale Sunday.\n\nThey haven\u2019t revealed the flavors yet, but have been hinting on Facebook that they involve ingredients like rose water, avocados, marzipan and apricot (three different flavors).\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://www.fresnobee.com/wps/build/images/fresnobee/logo.svg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.fresnobee.com/living/food-drink/bethany-clough/3lst4t/picture186898453/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/instacart2", "https://www.fresnobee.com/living/food-drink/bethany-clough/a8titi/picture232412342/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/FRS_EPZTACOSTIJUANA05.JPG", "https://www.fresnobee.com/latest-news/l9blnh/picture232249162/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/tinytacos.jpg", "https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/r8bpeg/picture232187597/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/AP_19176754976364.jpg", "https://www.fresnobee.com/wps/build/images/fresnobee/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=17471&contextPath=6990-17471&pubId=12&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=214722375&type=article&title=Free+ice+cream+and+french+fries+this+weekend%2C+plus+new+Ampersand+flavors%2C+%E2%80%98freak+shakes%E2%80%99&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fresnobee.com%2Fliving%2Ffood-drink%2Fbethany-clough%2Farticle214722375.html", "https://www.fresnobee.com/living/food-drink/bethany-clough/ivpa16/picture214869555/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/freakshak_fitted.jpeg", "https://www.fresnobee.com/latest-news/soappy/picture213599209/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/JRW%20CHIICKEN%20SHACK%202", "https://www.fresnobee.com/latest-news/wjuv5g/picture232451267/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/FRS_Whatsthatconstruction2_%20(3)", "https://www.fresnobee.com/latest-news/t2yso8/picture232451762/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/JRW%20FOOD%20FARMERS%205.JPG"], "top_img": "https://www.fresnobee.com/living/food-drink/bethany-clough/ivpa16/picture214869555/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/freakshak_fitted.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.fresnobee.com/living/food-drink/bethany-clough/article214722375.html", "title": "National Ice Cream Day and National Fry Day: Freebies at Fresno restaurants", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/fresnobee/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "FresnoBee", "title": "Free ice cream and french fries this weekend, plus new Ampersand flavors, \u2018freak shakes\u2019", "description": "National Ice Cream Day and National Fry Day mean free food at restaurants in the Fresno, CA area.
