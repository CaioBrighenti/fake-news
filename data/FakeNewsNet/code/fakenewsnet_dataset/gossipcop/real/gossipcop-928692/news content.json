In addressing the whole \"divorce sucks\" thing, she also revealed the lesson she learned through her split as well as some insight to what her life looks like now.\n\nThough Anna is said to be dating cinematographer Michael Barrett, she has not spoken about their relationship publicly and that seems to be very on purpose.\n\n\"I think it's a lesson learned a little bit in terms of keeping relationships a little more private, potentially, even though I pride myself on being a pretty open person. But, I don't know, it's tough when you're under the scrutiny.\"\n\nI mean, of course! The lesson is keep things a little more to yourself. And I think that applies to anyone - not just celebrities - these days. We're all so consumed with posting things on social media and keeping the world updated on our life, but maybe we should actually pull back a little! Just keep things a little more private.\n\nObviously the scrutiny is hugely amplified when you're someone like Anna, married to someone like Chris, but it sounds like Anna will be keeping her (potentially) current and future relationships more private.\n\nShe also talked about the importance of valuing yourself:\n\n\"I was such an insecure kid that if anybody [was] remotely attracted liked me I was just completely smitten. Like, I can't believe the popular guy likes me. I think my mom was always trying to reiterate: Value yourself, value yourself.\"\n\nI still am a little sad over Anna and Chris' break up, but if we keep getting lessons like this from them, I think we will all be okay.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet more from Sisanie here!\n\nPhoto: Getty Images", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ada07aa9ce2af646bfedfe1?ops=max(650,0),quality(80)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/60cf98c132eb40cc9ffe14e4837fc322?ops=max(120,120),quality(85)", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270798540384083&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/icon_assets/YAC_Icon.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/402baed9c97f21d206906bf371aebec3?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(96,60)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/402baed9c97f21d206906bf371aebec3?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(158,100),quality(90)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ada07aa9ce2af646bfedfe1"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ada07aa9ce2af646bfedfe1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://news.iheart.com/featured/sisanie/content/2018-04-20-the-important-lesson-anna-faris-learned-through-her-divorce/", "title": "The Lesson Anna Faris Learned From Chris Pratt Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "And it's a lesson we all could use", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ada07aa9ce2af646bfedfe1", "keywords": "Anna Faris", "og": {"title": "The Important Lesson Anna Faris Learned Through Her Divorce | Sisanie | iHeartRadio", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ada07aa9ce2af646bfedfe1", "url": "https://news.iheart.com/featured/sisanie/content/2018-04-20-the-important-lesson-anna-faris-learned-through-her-divorce/", "description": "And it's a lesson we all could use", "site_name": "Sisanie", "locale": "en_US"}, "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://news.iheart.com/featured/sisanie/content/2018-04-20-the-important-lesson-anna-faris-learned-through-her-divorce/", "site": "@sisanie", "creator": "@sisanie", "description": "And it's a lesson we all could use", "title": "The Important Lesson Anna Faris Learned Through Her Divorce | Sisanie | iHeartRadio", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ada07aa9ce2af646bfedfe1", "domain": "news.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "The Lesson Anna Faris Learned From Chris Pratt Divorce | Sisanie | iHeartRadio", "parsely-link": "https://news.iheart.com/featured/sisanie/content/2018-04-20-the-important-lesson-anna-faris-learned-through-her-divorce/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ada07aa9ce2af646bfedfe1", "parsely-tags": "Anna Faris", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "Sisanie", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ada07aa9ce2af646bfedfe1", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-04-20 11:19:00-04:00", "parsely-author": "Sisanie", "parsely-section": "Sisanie Blog (5507)"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524196800.0, "source": "https://news.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
