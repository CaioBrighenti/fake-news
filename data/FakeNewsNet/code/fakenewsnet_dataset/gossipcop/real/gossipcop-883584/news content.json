Together, stars Sasha Pieterse, Lucy Hale, Ashley Benson, Shay Mitchell, and Troian Bellisario get candid about making assistants cry, lying about their ages, and even on-set crushes.\n\nBenson and Mitchell admit to having had a crush on Nolan North, who played Mr. Hastings \u2014 a.k.a. Spencer\u2019s dad \u2014 on the series. Meanwhile, Hale revealed that way back in season 1 she actually had a crush on Ian Harding. Of course, PLL fans know that Harding played Ezra Fitz, who just so happened to be Hale\u2019s love interest on the show. (Spoiler alert: Their characters got married in the series finale.)\n\nFor more, watch the full video above.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/tcdprli_ec162.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/pll22.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/amazon.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-539297776.jpg?crop=0px%2C56px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5d549a7bf8665c5848d618ea9de89521?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/shay-mitchell-1.jpg?crop=195px%2C132px%2C2421px%2C1271px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/118878_0684_ful.jpg?crop=0px%2C108px%2C1800px%2C1800px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-539297776.jpg?crop=0px%2C56px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Highfill"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/28/pretty-little-liars-lucy-hale-crush-ian-harding/", "title": "'Pretty Little Liars': Lucy Hale reveals her season 1 crush on Ian Harding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Pretty Little Liars, Lucy Hale, Ian Harding, Never Have I Ever, The Ellen Show, Sasha Pieterse, Ashley Benson, Shay Mitchell, Troian Bellisario, PLL", "news_keywords": "Pretty Little Liars, Lucy Hale, Ian Harding, Never Have I Ever, The Ellen Show, Sasha Pieterse, Ashley Benson, Shay Mitchell, Troian Bellisario, PLL", "description": "The cast of 'Pretty Little Liars' plays a very revealing game of Never Have I Ever.", "og": {"title": "'Pretty Little Liars': Lucy Hale reveals her season 1 crush on Ian Harding", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/28/pretty-little-liars-lucy-hale-crush-ian-harding/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krGRMSn4BnY It's been three months since Pretty Little Liars ended, and now, the truth is finally coming out.
