Under his own label, #Merky, he\u2019s proved he doesn\u2019t need to sign to a major to top the charts, as he did with his debut album Gang Signs & Prayer, grime\u2019s first No1 album. Not only can he rap and sing, he\u2019s remained one of London\u2019s most inspiring young men, encouraging his listeners to vote, pray and speak openly about mental health.\n\nRead more: Watch Jared Leto sabotage GQ's Facebook Live stream at our Men Of The Year Awards\n\nEditor's Special Award: Stranger Things\n\nPresented by Natalie Dormer\n\n\u00a9 Netflix\n\nLast summer, something extraordinary happened. A group of completely unknown teenagers cycled onto our Netflix accounts in one of the best TV shows of the year. Within weeks, they were no longer kids, but world-famous actors, and we were talking about The Upside Down and asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Barb?\u201d Within months, those kids were award-winning too.The well deserved winners of the GQ Editor\u2019s Special Award are the boys of Stranger Things, Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo and Noah Schnapp!\n\nCreative Maverick of the Year: Sergei Polunin\n\nPresented by Erin O'Connor\n\n\u00a9 Doug Inglish\n\nThis winner has never done things by the book. One of the most gifted ballerinas of his generation, he quit the Royal Ballet just two years after becoming the youngest principal dancer in its history, going on not only to star in a David LaChapelle video set to Hozier\u2019s \u201cTake Me To The Church\u201d, which has been viewed more than 20 million times, but parlayed that into a film career that will see him star in Kenneth Brannagh\u2019s Murder On The Orient Express later this year. He\u2019s known as the \u201cbad boy of ballet\u201d, but he looks pretty good to us.\n\nSpecial Achievement of the Year: Antonio Conte\n\nPresented by Gordon Ramsey\n\n\u00a9 Claudio Porcarelli\n\nThere could only be one contender. Not only did our winner take the Premier League title at the first time of asking \u2013 something not done since Jos\u00e9 Mourinho first took over at Chelsea over a decade before. But it wasn\u2019t just the result \u2013 it was the manner of the win, setting a new Premier League record for most wins in a single season and becoming the first man in history to win three Manager Of The Month awards in a row. Now, he has yet another.\n\nBreakthrough Designer of the Year: Grace Wales Bonner\n\nPresented by Jaden Smith\n\n\u00a9 Piczo\n\nNot only did our next winner receive one of the most prestigious awards a young designer can receive, the 2016 LVMH Prize, she was assessed by one the most formidable judging panels: featuring Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs, Riccardo Tisci and JW Anderson, which says it all. This is a designer who, through her half-British, half-Jamaican upbringing, has translated London\u2019s wonderful cultural melting pot into fashion.\n\nGarage Act of the Year: Kurupt FM\n\nPresented by David Walliams\n\n\u00a9 Hamish Brown\n\nYou may know them from the momentous and in no way fictional BBC Three documentary series People Just Do Nothing that has charted their remarkable rise. You probably know them as the garage superstars that are MC Grindah, DJ Beats, Steves and their manager Chabuddy G. And while some fools will tell you it\u2019s a genius comedy that just won a BAFTA, GQ is having none of it.\n\nDesigner of the Year: Christopher Bailey\n\nPresented by Skepta\n\n\u00a9 Steve Schofield\n\nThe winner of our next award is picking up Designer Of The year, but he could just as easily have been picking up Innovator, or Entrepreneur, or maybe even Special Achievement. As the Chief Creative Officer of Burberry, he has been the driving force behind a succession of firsts \u2013 from being the first label to stream catwalk shows, to being the first to merge men\u2019s and women\u2019s collections, to pioneering an initiative that lets customers buy clothes they see on the catwalk later that day. Oh, and he did all this while ensuring Burberry remained the premier luxury label in the world.\n\nBand of the Year: Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds\n\nPresented by Courtney Love\n\n\u00a9 Tom Oldham\n\nAfter 34 years in the business, in which they\u2019ve produced 16 albums and won nine awards, their sound has constantly evolved. Last year\u2019s album, \"Skeleton Tree\", became their highest-charting album ever in the US and a No2 in the UK. This year's new compilation album, \"Lovely Creatures\", proves once again that they are, and always have been, in a league of their own.\n\nBreakthrough Actor of the Year: James Norton\n\nPresented by Tuppence Middleton\n\n\u00a9 Charlie Gray\n\nIn the past year, this winner has starred in not one, not two, but three hit TV shows, each one a conversation for the water cooler: as a heartthrob vicar in Grantchester, as a heartthrob prince in War & Peace, and a heartthrob psychopath in Happy Valley. We see a theme here\u2026 the man has good cheekbones. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome on stage GQ's Breakthrough Actor Of The Year, James Norton!\n\nHugo Boss Most Stylish Man: Zayn Malik\n\n\u00a9 Doug Inglish\n\nSome might say that going solo after years safely cocooned as a member of one of the world\u2019s most famous bands would be a risky move. Not for this man. His phenomenal first album, Mind Of Mine, hit No1 on both sides of the Atlantic, and with his debut single, \u201cPillowtalk\u201d, became only the third ever Brit to kick-start their solo career at the top of the American charts. But it\u2019s not just music \u2013 with a sense of style that is both effortless and idiosyncratic, it\u2019s our Hugo Boss Most Stylish Man, Zayn Malik.\n\nLegend of the Year: Sir Geoff Hurst\n\nPresented by GQ Editor Dylan Jones\n\n\u00a9 Jason Alden\n\nDuring his 13 years as a striker for West Ham United, he played more than 400 times and scored 242 goals, winning both the FA Cup and European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup. But it was one game and three goals \u2013 wearing the Three Lions of England \u2013 that ensured him sporting immortality. He remains the only player ever to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final.\n\nHugo Boss Woman of the Year: Adwoa Aboah\n\nPresented by Poppy Delevingne\n\n\u00a9 Mariano Vivanco\n\nOur next winner is less Woman Of The Year and more Woman Of A Generation. Not only has she fronted campaigns for the likes of Miu Miu and Calvin Klein, nabbed her first Vogue cover, and even appeared alongside Scarlett Johansson in Ghost In The Shell, she\u2019s inspired young women with her willingnesss to discuss mental health. In July, the 25-year-old created Gurls Talk: an online platform to empower young women with a safe, supportive community.\n\nTelevision Actor of the Year: Cillian Murphy\n\nPresented by Jamie Dornan\n\n\u00a9 John Balsom\n\nCillian has had a blinder of a year. He hit the big screen all-guns-blazing in Free Fire, won hearts and minds as the shell-shocked soldier in Christopher Nolan\u2019s magnificent Dunkirk and, this autumn, he returns in a role that he has made his own \u2013 as everyone\u2019s favourite Brummy bad-man, Tommy Shelby, in the fourth series of one of the most deliciously British dramas ever made, Peaky Blinders. No wonder it counts the likes of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt as super fans.\n\nTV Personalities of the Year: The Grand Tour\n\nPresented by Sir Ben Ainslie\n\n\u00a9 Gavin Bond\n\nSome say our next winners pulled one of the greatest coups in television history. Some say they\u2019re a cultural phenomenon. And some say they just like messing about in cars. All we know is, they\u2019re brilliant, and the reason to plug that little Amazon box into your TV. The first episode of The Grand Tour became Amazon Prime\u2019s most-watched series premiere in the world, and with a second series out later this year, they certainly have a reason to toot their own horn.\n\nMaddox Gallery Artist of the Year: Wolfgang Tillmans\n\nPresented by Winnie Harlow\n\n\u00a9 Karl Kolbitz\n\nWolfgang Tillmans is a German artist who began his career taking casual snapshots of his friends in 1991. In 2000, he became the first photographer, and first non-British artist, to be awarded the Tate\u2019s coveted annual Turner Prize and, this year, he bagged his first major solo show at Tate Modern. And no wonder: his art has been instrumental to understanding our socio-political climate. His distinctive poster campaign against Brexit displayed a solidarity that surpasses nationality. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he proves art doesn\u2019t just observe and comment, it has agency.\n\nComedians of the Year: Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon\n\nPresented by Jourdan Dunn\n\n\u00a9 Charlie Gray\n\nThis award goes to not one, but two of the funniest men in the country. And not only do they have talent, they also have the sweetest gig on TV \u2013 touring the north of England, then Italy, then Spain, eating the finest food, drinking the finest wine and doing the finest impressions of Michael Caine. They have turned bickering into an art-form and melancholy into a punchline. They are GQ\u2019s Comedians Of The Year \u2013 the brilliant stars of The Trip, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon!\n\nRock 'n' Roll Star of the Year: Liam Gallagher\n\nPresented by John Cooper Clarke\n\n\u00a9 Gavin Bond\n\nOnly 12 months ago, our next winner was ready to throw in the tambourine. But then he picked up his guitar, and within one year dropped a single, an album, a tour and, most importantly, landed a GQ cover. If that wasn\u2019t enough to warrant an award, in the wake of the Manchester bombing, he gave a cathartic, beautifully unifying performance to a city, and a nation, in need of it.\n\nSportsman of the Year: Anthony Joshua\n\nPresented by Idris Elba\n\n\u00a9 Matthew Brookes\n\nIf you didn\u2019t witness our next winner in May as he heroically defeated Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley then, frankly, where were you? Knocked down and off his feet by round six, our next winner fought back in a way rarely seen outside of Rocky films, cementing his status not just as the heavyweight champion of the world, but a national treasure in waiting.\n\nPolitician of the Year: Sadiq Khan\n\nPresented by Tinie Tempah\n\nOur next winner has had quite the year \u2013 just not in the way he\u2019d have wished. Yet the award of Politician Of The Year is as much about one\u2019s calm in a crisis, and leadership when leadership is needed most. Three terrorist attacks in three months, the Grenfell fire and countless lives lost \u2013 but tonight\u2019s recipient did not flag or waiver, he spoke of vigilance but not revolt, and he put his trust in the resolve of Londoners, who in turn put their trust in him.\n\nActor of the Year: Jared Leto\n\nPresented by Annabelle Wallis\n\n\u00a9 Gavin Bond\n\nOur next winner is an actor of outstanding ability. He is as at home playing the Joker in a lavish blockbuster like Suicide Squad as he is playing an Aids sufferer in the moving Dallas Buyers Club. He is an Oscar-winner, a musician, frontman of a band and a style icon. This year sees him giving another extraordinary display in the hotly anticipated Blade Runner sequel, Blade Runner 2049, and he is GQ\u2019s Actor of the Year.\"\n\nInspiration of the Year: Pel\u00e9\n\nPresented by Gareth Southgate\n\n\u00a9 Mauricio Nahas\n\nIt has been said that beauty is not the goal of competitive sports, but high-level sports are a prime venue for the expression of human beauty. That could barely be more true of our next winner. He is not responsible for football as we know it, but he is responsible for the highest ideals of it \u2013 it is he who is responsible for the notion of football as the beautiful game, to take a game and elevate it to an art-form. He is many of the awards you have heard given tonight all wrapped into one. He is a global Icon. He is a Legend. His Special Achievements include three World Cups. He is Edson Arantes do Nascimento. But you will know him, simply, as Pel\u00e9.\n\nIcon of the Year: Mark Hamill\n\nPresented by Simon Pegg\n\n\u00a9 Gavin Bond\n\nOur final winner collects the Icon award. It\u2019s an award that only goes to someone who has left an everlasting dent in the culture \u2013 and our next winner left a meteor crater. He is one of the best-loved action heroes of all time. He is the star of the biggest movie franchise in history. And this year, he is back \u2013 the last of his kind, in a galaxy far, far away... They don\u2019t make heroes like this any more...\n\nLike this?
