And as of Friday, June 8, the two-hour finale is available to stream on Netflix. The special was directed by Sense8 creator Lana Wachowski and promises to give fans a proper conclusion to the series.\n\nThe series about eight people connected through cosmic ways was canceled by Netflix weeks after its second season premiered. Wachowski credited \u201cthe passionate letters, the petitions, the collective voice that rose up\u201d from the legion of die-hard Sense8 fans with the show\u2019s revival, according to the heartfelt letter she shared on the show\u2019s official Facebook page.\u201dImprobably, unforeseeably, your love has brought Sense8 back to life.\u201d This is quite surprising since the show\u2019s official Facebook page informed fans days after the show\u2019s cancellation that their petitions and messages were heard but not enough to bring the show back to Netflix.\n\nThe letter not only revived hope of Sense8\u2018s return to our lives but also gave the most definitive answer as to why it was canceled in the first place. In the letter, Wachowski stated Netflix did \u201clove the show as much as we do, but the numbers have always been challenging.\u201d She did not clarify if the numbers she was referring to were low viewership data, the expensive production cost, or both. Either way, that point is now moot in the face of the show\u2019s return and opportunity for closure.\n\nDespite the finality of its brief return, there\u2019s still a sliver of hope that Sense 8 could continue on even further. At the time of its revival from cancellation, Wachowski would not rule out even more Sense8 in the future, writing, \u201cAfter that \u2026 if this experience has taught me anything, you NEVER know.\u201d\n\nThe new two-hour special is the second of its kind in the series. Two days before Christmas in 2016, Netflix released a two-hour holiday special called Happy F*cking New Year.\n\nSense8 was part of Netflix\u2019s cancellation spree that saw fan-favorites The Get Down, Marco Polo, and the star-studded drama Bloodline canceled within eight months of each other. Unfortunately for fans of those other series, they have not enjoyed the swift resurrection that Sense 8 received.\n\nUpdate on June 8: The series finale is available on Netflix.", "images": ["https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/shows-to-stream-sense8-1200x630-c-ar1.91.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/shows-to-stream-sense8-1200x630-c-ar1.91.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Parker Hall", "Will Nicol", "Andy Boxall", "Steven Petite", "Rick Marshall", "Chris Gates", "Ryan Waniata", "Brie Barbee"], "canonical_link": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/netflix-sense8-return-special/", "title": "Two-Hour 'Sense 8' Finale is Now Streaming on Netflix", "meta_data": {"tags": "lana wachowski,Netflix,Sense8", "description": "After a successful fan-lead petition campaign successfully changed Netflix's mind, the sci-fi drama Sense8 has returned from its premature end with a two-hour special, bringing with it all the cool fight sequences and deep interpersonal connections fans loved enough to bring it back from cancelation.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Two-Hour 'Sense 8' Finale is Now Streaming on Netflix | Digital Trends", "description": "After a successful fan-lead petition campaign successfully changed Netflix's mind, the sci-fi drama Sense8 has returned from its premature end with a two-hour special, bringing with it all the cool fight sequences and deep interpersonal connections fans loved enough to bring it back from cancelation.", "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/netflix-sense8-return-special/", "site_name": "Digital Trends", "updated_time": "2018-06-08T16:06:41-07:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/shows-to-stream-sense8-1200x630-c-ar1.91.png", "secure_url": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/shows-to-stream-sense8-1200x630-c-ar1.91.png", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/digitaltrends", "author": "facebook.com/phallpdx", "tag": "Sense8", "section": "Movies & TV", "published_time": "2018-06-08T16:06:31-07:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-08T16:06:41-07:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "After a successful fan-lead petition campaign successfully changed Netflix's mind, the sci-fi drama Sense8 has returned from its premature end with a two-hour special, bringing with it all the cool fight sequences and deep interpersonal connections fans loved enough to bring it back from cancelation.", "title": "Two-Hour 'Sense 8' Finale is Now Streaming on Netflix | Digital Trends", "site": "@digitaltrends", "image": "https://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/shows-to-stream-sense8-510x0.png", "creator": "@pwhall"}, "news_keywords": "Lana Wachowski, Sense8, Netflix, The Get Down, Marco Polo,", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=500266645, affiliate-data=11lnN7", "fb": {"pages": 8522591132, "app_id": 61377565444}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "theme-color": "#0095da", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYU8w4ONQVo?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1528499191.0, "source": "https://www.digitaltrends.com", "summary": ""}
