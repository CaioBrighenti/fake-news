Culture and history seldom pivot on one moment alone, and almost never do so on the back of a single TV episode \u2014 even one watched by 36 million people.\n\nThe April 1997 Time magazine cover featuring Ellen DeGeneres' coming out. (Photo: Time)\n\nYet despite those caveats, there\u2019s little doubt that DeGeneres\u2019 decision to publicly embrace her homosexuality \u2014 and, with ABC\u2019s reluctant but eventual cooperation, to extend that embrace to her fictional character \u2014 was a watershed in how gay men and women are treated on TV. And over time, the lessons we learn from TV seep into real life.\n\nGranted, Ellen Morgan was not the first gay character to enter our homes through our TV sets. Viewers had already seen Billy Crystal's star-making performance in the 1977 sitcom Soap as the long-suffering Jodie Dallas, though he had more on-air relationships with women than with men. And more than a year before Ellen\u2019s coming-out declaration, NBC's Friends had aired \"The One with the Lesbian Wedding\" of Susan and Carol \u2014 transforming a couple who had initially served as a reflected joke on Ross into people in their own right.\n\nStill, for the most part, gay men and women were as invisible on TV as they were in movies \u2014 making occasional appearances as characters whose tragic disgrace was linked to a hinted-at \u201clove that dare not speak its name.\u201d The most you'd find were asexual camp twists on the traditional \u201csissy\u201d stereotype, such as Paul Lynde\u2019s Uncle Arthur in Bewitched, or \u201cconfirmed bachelors\u201d like the one Tony Randall played in the 1981 series Love, Sidney \u2014 a character who had been gay in the TV movie that launched the show but was neutered once it went to series.\n\nEllen DeGeneres, left, looks uncomfortable when Laura Dern's character perceives her as gay in the \"The Puppy Episode\" of 'Ellen.' Airdate: April 30, 1997. (Photo: ABC Photo Archives, ABC Photo Archives/Getty Images)\n\nThen came Ellen, a slight sitcom that had struggled creatively for four seasons because it was stuck in a story-generating dead end: DeGeneres and ABC were not ready for the character to be a lesbian, but DeGeneres was uncomfortable playing straight. Finally, after many rumors and much buildup, Ellen Morgan came out in a two-part, late-season episode that cast Laura Dern as the woman who made Ellen realize who she was.\n\nThere was resistance: from advertisers, conservative advocacy groups, and so-called \"tolerant\" people who were fine with homosexuals as long as they didn\u2019t force their gay \"lifestyle\" upon them. An argument, by the way, generally made by heterosexuals who have no idea of how often they assert their own sexuality on a daily basis in the pictures on their desks, the conversations they have about their spouses or their children, and the way they interact. As well they should.\n\nA large crowd packs the Love Lounge, on April 30, 1997, in West Hollywood, to watch the TV sitcom 'Ellen,' where the title character, played by Ellen DeGeneres, comes out and says she is gay. There was much cheering when the actual words \"I am gay,\" were said. (Photo: Mark J. Terrill, AP)\n\nMore importantly, in the fifth and final season, there was resistance from viewers, who began to wander away. Prejudice may have played some part (exacerbated by the ludicrous \"adult content\" warnings ABC slapped on the episodes), but the truth may be that a show as paper-thin as Ellen was not ready to carry the burden of a groundbreaking subject, particularly when sending a message seemed to become its only purpose.\n\nThe show disappeared, and DeGeneres\u2019s career took a hit, but the world did not end \u2014 for her, for ABC or for Hollywood. And because the world and the business went on, others were able to step forward, through shows as varied as Will & Grace, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Queer as Folk, Six Feet Under, Brothers and Sisters, True Blood, Glee, Modern Family and Sunday's American Gods \u2014 a Starz soft-core fantasy that takes us way past those first-step Will & Grace days when characters could be homosexual as long as no sex was involved.\n\nIn essence, it's a progression every minority knows. You\u2019re not seen at all, or you\u2019re so disguised, it\u2019s as good as not being seen. Then you\u2019re only seen at your perceived worst, as murderers, suicides, sex fiends, and other figures of tragedy. Slowly, progress comes \u2014 though that usually means, at first anyway, that you're only seen at what society thinks of as your best, or your safest.\n\nThe hope for all is that one day, you'll be accorded the same rights as the majority: To be seen as who you are, in full, and treated as well or as badly as everyone else. Which means for every wonderful, romantic love story like London Spy, you have to accept a sex-fest reality mess like Thursday's Fire Island, on Logo. Because that's the cost and reward of freedom.\n\nAnd at least in part, we have Ellen \u2014 and Ellen \u2014 to thank.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2q6s72M", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/622ad642452012b81f3f8ff034ee8d69bccd3cb9/c=1-0-795-1059/local/-/media/2017/04/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636287987246840097-Ellen-DeGeneres-Time-Magazine-cover-.jpg?width=180&height=240&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-nav-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f746eb85d23fb26bd756d0ad559c8b0afc120da3/c=20-0-1508-1984/local/-/media/2017/04/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636287989983877642-Ellen-watch-party.jpg?width=180&height=240&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5005.62.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a3b91a9f5c00b92d1c3021f195486831e0b00ab/c=146-0-4998-3648/local/-/media/2017/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636204352693501728--DIC-14.JPG?width=534&height=401&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5005.62.0/images/indicators/facebook-loading.gif", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-masthead-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/49d8fae6361ed5ba54666f62d71d11aca86b846f/c=0-596-5141-3501/local/-/media/2017/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636204352693501728--DIC-14.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f798ee5fca3da538ded099a785f27a1e2c0522e/c=208-0-2152-2592/local/-/media/2017/04/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636287979000783238-The-Puppy-Episode.JPG?width=180&height=240&fit=crop"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/49d8fae6361ed5ba54666f62d71d11aca86b846f/c=0-596-5141-3501/local/-/media/2017/01/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636204352693501728--DIC-14.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Bianco", "Published P.M.
