The series, which comes from showrunner Stacy McKee, will be called \u201cStation 19.\u201d\n\nSeries executive producer Paris Barclay announced the title on Twitter on Thursday, saying, \u201cWelcome all of them to @STATION19 #greysanatomy spin-off.\u201d\n\nThe spinoff is set at Seattle Fire Station 19 in Seattle, Wash., in the same universe as \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and will see Jason George\u2019s Dr. Ben Warren giving up his life as a surgeon to become a firefighter. With his new firehouse home being just blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial, producers of the show have said there may be opportunity to see some characters crossover between the two series.\n\nAt the Alphabet\u2019s Television Critics Assn. press tour panel in early January 2018, McKee said they were still considering a few options for the show\u2019s title. ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey noted that \u201ccoming up with a title is one of the most challenging things we do\u201d and pointed out that the network executives at the time did not select a title for \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d until right before that series debuted in 2005, either.\n\n\u201cWe really want to make sure that what we settle on is perfect,\u201d Dungey said.\n\n\u201cStation 19,\u201d which falls under Shonda Rhimes\u2019 Shondaland banner, stars George, Jaina Lee Ortiz, Grey Damon, Barrett Doss, Alberto Frezza, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Miguel Sandoval.\n\nOrtiz also announced the title on Twitter, with a little bonus video from the cast:\n\n\u201cStation 19\u201d will premiere with a special two-hour event on ABC Mar. 22 before taking its usual \u201cTGIT\u201d time slot of 9 p.m. on Mar. 29.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
