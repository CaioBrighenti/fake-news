HGTV\u2019s Property Brothers, have another sibling. But, apparently, not everyone knows that.\n\nSome Twitter users are trying to wrap their heads around the existence of J.D. Scott, while others posted reactions to a throwback photo unearthed by BuzzFeed writer Brad Esposito. Scott himself is also getting in on the fun as users liken his previous look to Fall Out Boy\u2019s Pete Wentz, Joan Jett, and \u201can Adam Lambert impersonator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was method to that madness,\u201d Scott tweeted to Esposito of the photo. And as it turns out, Scott was actually a Lambert impersonator at one point in his career, he revealed in a Twitter exchange.\n\nthis pic of the third Property Brother has me seriously messed up pic.twitter.com/UZyWYl6e69 \u2014 brad esposito (@braddybb) April 6, 2017\n\nYou win!

In 2014, he shared a video of one of his final performances at the Imperial Palace with a Pink impersonator.\n\nScott was also a member of the Canadian sketch comedy ensemble YFG and the Loose Moose Improv group, and he\u2019s worked both in front of and behind the camera on various projects. Now, as he says, he\u2019s \u201call @hgtv.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The 22 Worst Reality TV Shows of All Time\n\n\u201cA fitting #tbt photo for sure,\u201d he added of the image on Instagram. \u201cI think the internet has mashed @mrsilverscott and me up, he\u2019s the illusionist. I was an Adam Lambert impersonator years ago which accounts for that awesome emo hair.\u201d\n\nScott was recently spotted in PEOPLE\u2019s cover story on Dave and Jonathan. \u201cI have been getting texts, emails and social media messages all week from friends saying \u2018I saw you in @people magazine!'\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWhat an honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always gotten along,\u201d he told the magazine of his brothers. \u201cWe\u2019re great friends.\u201d\n\nI have been getting texts, emails and social media messages all week from friends saying 'I saw you in @people magazine!'
