Seacrest told the industry bible: \"I've always loved the show. And if I could do it forever, I would do it forever.\"", "images": ["https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12105336/ant-mcpartlin-lisa-armstrong.jpg", "http://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2017/06/14225000/ryan-seacrest.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12110347/love_island_sr5_ep34_03.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12160320/love_island_sr5_ep35_08.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/11145441/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-12.50.20.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/08162631/Emmerdale-29.jpg", "http://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2017/05/11182520/Kelly-Ripa-and-Ryan-Seacrest_edited-1.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12104249/Karen-and-Linda-EastEnders.png.png", "http://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2017/06/14224724/Ryan-Seacrest-Kelly-Ripa-Michael-Strahan.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2018/11/14154150/Adam-Barlow-returns-to-Weatherfield-ITV.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12173532/SPL5058470_011-e1562949369160.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/06/03125513/gemma-collins1.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12141315/gmb2.png.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12160910/spl1469829_035-e1562944176263.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12124035/bruce.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/06/14153251/SPL5071687_061-e1560522800930.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12110604/philip.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12135951/Lydia-Hart-Jenny-Finn-Emmerdale.png.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/11164535/jack-p-shepherd.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12153125/Tina-OBrien-.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/08162648/Corrie-29.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/06/03150806/david-beckhamm.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2017/05/02211536/michael-strahan.png", "http://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2017/05/01175417/kr5.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/09162335/victoria-beckham.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12145345/Loose-Women-Paddy-McGuinness-3.jpg.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12130030/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-12.59.54.png", "http://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2017/06/14224207/Regis-Philbin-Kelly-Ripa.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12145626/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-14.56.08.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12130950/sheridan-smith.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12153042/peter-andre.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2019/07/12151420/curtis-massages-maura-love-island.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2017/05/02211536/michael-strahan.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/how-michael-strahan-congratulated-ryan-seacrest-on-his-live-job/", "title": "How Michael Strahan congratulated Ryan Seacrest on his \u2018Live\u2019 job", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#d60b52", "fb": {"app_id": 303845166667914, "pages": 134835233203390}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Daily UK", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/how-michael-strahan-congratulated-ryan-seacrest-on-his-live-job/", "type": "article", "title": "How Michael Strahan congratulated Ryan Seacrest on his \u2018Live\u2019 job", "description": "And Regis Philbin had something to say too", "updated_time": "2017-06-14T21:51:41+00:00", "image": "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2017/05/02211536/michael-strahan.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@entdailyuk"}, "article": {"author": "Entertainment Daily", "modified_time": "2017-06-14T21:51:41+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/entertainmentdailyfix", "published_time": "2017-06-14T21:51:41+00:00", "tag": "Ryan Seacrest"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497477101.0, "source": "http://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk", "summary": ""}
