For her efforts to help the victims' families after the tragedy, the 24-year-old singer was made an honorary citizen of Manchester last July.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nAriana Grande Teases New Album's 2018 Release on Instagram\n\nScooter Braun Opens Up About Ariana Grande's Trauma After Manchester Bombing\n\nAriana Grande Pulls Out of Manchester Attack Tribute After Doctor's Order Not to Fly", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161760651.jpg?itok=MLRyG4zA&h=bd7808dd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?itok=egAXhx3e", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/street-style-outfit-nordstrom-anniversary-sale-1280.jpg?itok=eyAT2Bws&h=e6a33408", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x169/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1242911076001_5599239294001_5599239622001-vs.jpg?itok=iWGX_9C6", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?itok=ekfLlyX0&h=be38bc70"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?itok=egAXhx3e", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/liam-gallagher-steps-in-for-ariana-grande-with-manchester-tribute-at-2018-brit-awards-96837", "title": "Liam Gallagher Steps In for Ariana Grande With Manchester Tribute at 2018 BRIT Awards", "meta_data": {"title": "Liam Gallagher Steps In for Ariana Grande With Manchester Tribute at 2018 BRIT Awards | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/liam-gallagher-steps-in-for-ariana-grande-with-manchester-tribute-at-2018-brit-awards-96837", "title": "Liam Gallagher Steps In for Ariana Grande With Manchester Tribute at 2018 BRIT Awards", "description": "A source told ET on Wednesday that Grande was forced to pull out of the show due to health reasons.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?itok=egAXhx3e", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A source told ET on Wednesday that Grande was forced to pull out of the show due to health reasons.", "title": "Liam Gallagher Steps In for Ariana Grande With Manchester Tribute at 2018 BRIT Awards", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/liam-gallagher-steps-in-for-ariana-grande-with-manchester-tribute-at-2018-brit-awards-96837", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?itok=egAXhx3e"}, "description": "A source told ET on Wednesday that Grande was forced to pull out of the show due to health reasons.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, Awards, Music, News, Ariana Grande", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, Awards, Music, News, Ariana Grande"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
