It\u2019s a bit overwhelming if there\u2019s a lot of people there you don\u2019t know, some celebrities. And so this woman came up to me and said, \u2018Hi again. Nice to meet you.\u2019 \u201c\n\nO\u2019Neill remembered knowing that she was famous, but he couldn\u2019t place who she was. \u201d \u2018You want a selfie? Let\u2019s do a selfie,\u2019 \u201d Swift, 28, asked an unknowing O\u2019Neill.\n\nAfter the duo took the snap, O\u2019Neill texted his daughter, Sophia, and asked her who the woman was. \u201cI said, \u2018I desperately need to know a name so that when I leave and say the name: \u2018Wonderful to meet you,\u2019 \u201d he recalled texting his daughter.\n\nWATCH: Jesse Tyler Ferguson Impersonates Other Characters on \u201cModern Family\u201d\n\nAlthough O\u2019Neill didn\u2019t recognize Swift, the audience roared with laughter when they immediately realized he was posing with the \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d singer as their selfie appeared on the screen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having you committed,\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s daughter jokingly texted him when she saw the photo via text.\n\nEven DeGeneres was surprised at O\u2019Neill. \u201cYou really didn\u2019t recognize Taylor Swift?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d O\u2019Neil asserted. \u201cAgain, I only see them when they\u2019re performing. So when you see them in a backyard, I thought it\u2019s a pretty girl. \u2026 Again, I\u2019m getting old.\u201d\n\nBut he played it off. \u201cI did say, \u2018Nice to meet you, Taylor,\u2019 when I left the party,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\nWhile O\u2019Neill\u2019s Swift story may come as a surprise to some, this isn\u2019t the first time that O\u2019Neill hasn\u2019t recognized a pop singer who has asked for a photo with the actor.\n\nIn spring 2015, Britney Spears asked O\u2019Neill for a picture when she saw him waiting in the airport.\n\n\u201c\u2018Could you please \u2026 and I know you\u2019re in a hurry\u2026\u2019\u201d O\u2019Neill told DeGeneres in June 2016 of Spears\u2019 fan-girl photo request.\n\nFancy running into this guy! \ud83d\ude4f\u263a\ufe0f Such a sweetheart!! pic.twitter.com/jqyVIVmu30 \u2014 Britney Spears (@britneyspears) March 21, 2015\n\n\u201cSo I said, \u2018Sure, fine, you know, okay.\u2019 So she sat there, and we took it, and I said, \u2018Have a nice trip. I\u2019m going,\u2019\u201d and I left. So the next day, my manager texts me and goes, \u2018What is this? 53,000 likes. It\u2019s Britney Spears.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, look at my face: Do I look like I\u2019m sitting with Britney Spears?\u201d O\u2019Neill joked. \u201cYou know, my daughter, Sophia, she said, \u2018You are a moron.\u2019 \u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/zendayaeuphoria.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2866px%2C1504.65px&resize=1200%2C630",
