Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski aren't just \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts anymore \u2014 they're also husband and wife.\n\nA spokesperson for the duo confirmed the happy news to TODAY.\n\nThe small event took place in Washington, at an especially fitting location for the former congressman and Brzezinski \u2014 the National Archives, with the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence serving as a backdrop to the ceremony.\n\nThe pair's \"Morning Joe\" pal \u2014 and our very own Sunday TODAY anchor \u2014 Willie Geist wasn't able to attend (due to some \"very early morning television\" the next day), but he spoke about the wedding on the show Monday.\n\n\"Joe and Mika are off today and this week. Why, you ask? They had a very busy weekend,\" he stated early in the broadcast, before sharing a few details with viewers. \"Joe and Mika were surrounded by all of their children, which made it very special for them.\"\n\nIn addition to Scarborough's four kids and her two, all from previous marriages, family from both sides and a small group of close friends gathered together to witness their union.\n\nThe couple exchanged vows at the National Archives. Miller Hawkins\n\n\"We wanted it to be really small and simple and not what you expected from Mika and Joe,\" the bride, who wore a white midi-length dress covered in a sheer polka-dot lace, told Vanity Fair Saturday. \"Everything we do is exposed, and everything felt exposed every step of the way, so we want this to be private until it\u2019s over. We wanted to recognize it more quietly and have the people who are most important to us around us.\"\n\nKeeping the guest list short was just one way they assured the event would remain a secret ahead of time. They shared with the publication that the invitations were extended via phone calls rather than hard copies, the reservations were made under the name of a friend and the Thanksgiving weekend date was selected for the rare hubbub-free time it brings to Washington.\n\nScarborough added, \"We made the decision a year ago to dramatically change our lives and have a low-key existence. The more time we can spend with our family, the happier we are.\"\n\nAnd they were clearly happy on Saturday \u2014 as were those in attendance.\n\nScarborough's former House colleague, Rep. Elijah Cummings, officiated the wedding, and he later tweeted that \"it was a pleasure\" to do so.\n\nCongratulations to Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough! It was a pleasure to officiate your beautiful wedding. I wish you years of love and happiness together! \u2014 Elijah E. Cummings (@RepCummings) November 25, 2018\n\nShortly after the nuptials, rather than sharing a wedding pic, Brzezinski took to Instagram with a photo of her holding a small amphibian and puckering up.\n\nIn the caption, she simply wrote, \"I kissed the frog.\"\n\nThis marriage marks the third for Scarborough, 55, and second for Brzezinski, 51. They've worked side-by-side on \"Morning Joe\" for more than 11 years and announced their engagement last spring.", "images": ["https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389848/joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-wedding-today-main-181126_fc4e8e1259976279d6e684ab64584a51.fit-760w.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389848/joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-wedding-today-main-181126_fc4e8e1259976279d6e684ab64584a51.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389848/joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-wedding-today-main-181126_fc4e8e1259976279d6e684ab64584a51.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/news/morning-joe-co-hosts-joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-get-married-t143777", "title": "Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski get married in private ceremony", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/news/morning-joe-co-hosts-joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-get-married-t143777", "title": "Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski get married in private ceremony", "description": "The \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts said \"I do\" over the long holiday weekend.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389848/joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-wedding-today-main-181126_fc4e8e1259976279d6e684ab64584a51.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389848/joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-wedding-today-main-181126_fc4e8e1259976279d6e684ab64584a51.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389848/joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-wedding-today-main-181126_fc4e8e1259976279d6e684ab64584a51.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski get married in private ceremony", "description": "The \"Morning Joe\" co-hosts said \"I do\" over the long holiday weekend.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The \"Morning Joe\" on-screen partners said \"I do\" off-screen over the long holiday weekend.", "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_48/1389848/joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-wedding-today-main-181126_fc4e8e1259976279d6e684ab64584a51.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543241400.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
