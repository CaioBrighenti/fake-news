On Thursday, the Wayward Sisters backdoor pilot makes its debut (The CW, 8/7c), and the female-led offshoot\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t be more, well, timely.\n\n\u201cNow is the time that television and movies are discovering that a lot of women want to have their stories told by women, [and] they want to have their voices heard,\u201d Briana Buckmaster, who plays Jody\u2019s friend/ally Sheriff Donna Hanscum, says. \u201cThis is an opportunity that Supernatural and The CW is giving to all of us as a viewership and a fandom.\u201d\n\nHer Wayward co-star Katherine Ramdeen, aka Jody\u2019s surrogate daughter Alex Jones, echoes the sentiment: \u201cStarting off 2018 with this powerful show, with six powerful, strong, female leads, is exactly what the world needs right now. I think people are going to love it.\u201d\n\nThe sisterhood \u2014 which also includes hunter Claire Novak (Kathryn Newton), psychic Patience (Clark Backo) and dreamwalker Kaia (Yadira Guevara-Prip) \u2014 is brought together by a rescue mission after Dean and Sam go missing. (Quick refresher: They got transported to The Bad Place, unbeknownst to Jody & Co.) Like many of the Wayward characters, Alex \u201cowes the boys her life,\u201d Ramdeen notes. \u201cI think she thinks of them as uncles. So she wants to help in any way she can.\u201d\n\nBut the episode is not about propping up Dean and Sam. \u201cThe women in the pilot are not there to solely serve the Winchesters, or to serve any men. They\u2019re there to help others and save themselves,\u201d Buckmaster says. \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting opportunity for viewers to see six regular women from all walks of life learning to save themselves and be their own heroes.\u201d\n\nWith so many diverse characters, the dynamics among the ensemble are bound to be as complicated as they are rich. Case in point: When prodigal daughter Claire returns home, she finds that her bed is being occupied by Patience, who \u201ccomes from a different background than a lot of the women,\u201d Buckmaster explains. \u201cA lot of the women come from rougher beginnings, and Patience was raised at a little bit of a higher class. It will be interesting to see what that character brings, or learns, even.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, established faves Claire and Alex \u2014 the latter of whom is now living a \u201cdouble life\u201d as a nursing assistant and a part-time hunter \u2014 are \u201cas close to sisters as sisters can be,\u201d even if they\u2019re not blood siblings, Ramdeen shares. \u201cAlex loves Claire, and Claire loves Alex, but sisters can fight and just annoy each other.\u201d At the end of the day, however, \u201cit\u2019s such a loving relationship that they\u2019re able to press each others\u2019 buttons, but know that there\u2019s love behind that.\u201d\n\nAs Jody opens her home and heart to even more lost young women with Patience and Kaia, the potential spinoff establishes that it has more in common with its mothership series than just hunters and monsters. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in Supernatural: \u2018Family doesn\u2019t end with blood,\u2019 and that\u2019s the show,\u201d Ramdeen says. \u201cThat\u2019s Wayward.\u201c\n\nWatch a trailer for the episode airing this Thursday, then hit the comments with your hopes for the offshoot.", "images":
