The actresses were among the earliest to come forward with their stories of being sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein, bringing into stark relief the impact Weinstein had on their careers and on Hollywood at large. Sorvino, who won an Oscar in 1996 for the Weinstein-released Mighty Aphrodite, told The New Yorker she believed that, by turning down Weinstein\u2019s advances, he had actively discouraged other filmmakers from working with her. Judd, who spoke to The New York Times for the first blockbuster story about Weinstein, said at the time, \u201cWomen have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it\u2019s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.\u201d (Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.)\n\nIn December, Peter Jackson told New Zealand\u2019s Stuff that executives at Miramax told him about both Judd and Sorvino, \u201cthey were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998. At the time, we had no reason to question what these guys were telling us\u2014but in hindsight, I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing. I now suspect we were fed false information about both of these talented women\u2014and as a direct result their names were removed from our casting list.\u201d\n\nSorvino tweeted an emotional response to Jackson\u2019s revelation:\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair\u2019s Krista Smith on the red carpet, Judd and Sorvino spoke about the goals of the Time\u2018s Up movement: \u201cI want people to know that this movement isn\u2019t stopping, we\u2019re going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,\u201c Sorvino said:\n\nDuring the ceremony, Judd will present an award alongside two other women who have accused Weinstein: Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek. As Rebecca Keegan reported from the Oscars rehearsals, Sciorra\u2014who claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein raped her, and that her career suffered as a result\u2014seemed visibly overwhelmed to be onstage.\n\nThough the Time\u2019s Up movement, which announced its presence forcefully with pins and an all-black dress code at the Golden Globes, announced it planned to look beyond the red carpet in its activism, Judd and Sorvino\u2019s united presence was a reminder of how striking, and symbolic, a red carpet appearance can be.\n\nInside the 2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party\n\n\n\n1 / 115 Chevron Chevron Photograph by Hannah Thomson.
