The ones that you\u2019ve spent entire brunches/text threads/email chains telling your friends about? They\u2019re the best of the best\u2026so amazing that you\u2019d never risk putting them in a piece of checked luggage. At Well+Good, we call those our Beauty VIPs (you know, Very Important Products). In this series, we ask women in wellness and the public eye what beauty products they use every single day and why\u2014with an entire Internet of options to choose from\u2014these items stand out.\n\nWould it surprise you to learn that Julianne Hough swears by essentially the same beauty routine you did as a teenager? This is more or less what I discover while grilling the newly minted redhead for all the deets surrounding her forever-flawless face, which always seems to be gracing either the stage or screen.\n\nTo get that glow, the down-to-earth Hough relies heavily upon a teen-beloved skincare line (more on that below), drugstore makeup, and something my mom always nagged me about when I was younger: hydration. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t well hydrated, and drinking regular water isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she tells me from a Propel event in Los Angeles. \u201cYou really have to replenish the electrolytes you are losing\u2014that\u2019s my not-so-secret secret.\u201d\n\nThis simple trick appears to be paying off in spades in terms of creating a natural glow, as Hough\u2019s daily makeup routine is best described as minimal. \u201cI just wear a little bit of concealer, some gel on my eyebrows, and I do a quick little contour on my cheeks,\u201d she tells me as we talk more things makeup at a separate Fitbit event. \u201c[For meetings], I amp it up a bit more by adding a bronze-y eyeshadow, a smudged eyeliner on the top so it\u2019s not too perfect, and a coral-pink lip.\u201d\n\nKeep scrolling for the must-have beauty products that *make* her look.", "images": ["https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/themes/wellgood-2016/assets/img/made-in-ny.png", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/My-Beauty-VIPs-Julianna-Hough.png", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-narcissists-Ben-Pipe-Photography-600x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/UltaBeauty-CCA2-Branded-Feature-Stocksy-Gabrielle-Lutze-1400px.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/chard-recipes-flora-and-vino-608x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GettyImages-982735026.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WG-Plusfactor-Cookbook-April-150x150.png", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-186366201-600x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BobMills-1631-CCA2-Branded-Feature-1400\u00a9-Allard-Schager-608x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/themes/wellgood-2016/assets/img/spacer.gif", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/erin-bunch-150x150.png", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CCA_1602_Thermacell_Branded-Feature-1400px.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-three-women-kupicoo-599x400.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/My-Beauty-VIPs-Julianna-Hough.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wellandgood.com/good-looks/julianne-hough-my-beauty-vips/", "title": "Julianne Hough's favorite beauty products", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/favicon-194x194.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"pages": 91915774693}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@iamwellandgood", "site": "@iamwellandgood", "title": "Julianne Hough's favorite beauty products | Well+Good", "description": "Multi-hyphenate Julianne Hough shares her beauty faves, including products from J&J, La Mer, and more.", "image": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/My-Beauty-VIPs-Julianna-Hough.png"}, "description": "Multi-hyphenate Julianne Hough shares her beauty faves, including products from J&J, La Mer, and more.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Julianne Hough's favorite beauty products | Well+Good", "description": "Multi-hyphenate Julianne Hough shares her beauty faves, including products from J&J, La Mer, and more.", "url": "https://www.wellandgood.com/good-looks/julianne-hough-my-beauty-vips/", "site_name": "Well+Good", "updated_time": "2018-04-12T13:24:10+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/My-Beauty-VIPs-Julianna-Hough.png", "secure_url": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/My-Beauty-VIPs-Julianna-Hough.png", "width": 872, "height": 574, "alt": "Beauty VIPs"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/iamwellandgood", "tag": "skincare", "section": "Good Looks", "published_time": "2018-04-12T13:00:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-12T13:24:10+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.1.1", "pocket-site-verification": "e5ab52bbadc2281f4803a907a07a48"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523538033.0, "source": "https://www.wellandgood.com", "summary": ""}
