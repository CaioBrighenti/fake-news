In a new interview, actress Robin Wright \u2014 who played Buttercup in the 1987 fantasy flick \u2014 revealed just why there will never be a sequel.\n\n\"I think they entertained the idea for a minute. We thought, 'Don't ruin it. Please don't ruin it,'\" she told E! News. However, that doesn't mean she didn't love working on the movie the first time around! She told the outlet, \"We were shooting in the middle of nowhere up in the north. It was just us down in the restaurant at night after shooting and it was a big, happy family just having a hoot of a time and playing music at night and cooking dinner and shooting a really great, iconic film.\"\n\nThe Princess Bride cast in 2012.\n\nThe Princess Bride also starred the likes of Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, and Billy Crystal. This year marks the 30-year anniversary of the film, where \"A young boy's grandfather reads him a story called The Princess Bride while sick in bed,\" according to IMDB. Not going to lie, we totally feel old knowing that this movie came out 30 YEARS AGO.\n\nScroll through the gallery to see what the cast looks like today!", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/carrie-underwood-mike-fisher-pic.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/peta-maksim.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/julianne-hough-brooks-laich-celebrate-2-year-wedding-anniversary.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/the-princess-bride-cast.jpg?w=1180#038;h=625&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cary-elwes-princess-bride.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cary-elwes-princess-bride.jpg?resize=1000%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/david-victoria-beckham.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/robin-wright-princess-bride.jpg?fit=200%2C1"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cary-elwes-princess-bride.jpg?resize=1000%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amber Belus", "Sep"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/robin-wright-the-princess-bride-sequel-142769/", "title": "Robin Wright Says 'the Princess Bride' Sequel Won't Be Happening", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "RIP to our hopes and dreams, because The Princess Bride will never make a comeback.
