Right now my kids are my main focus.\u201d Dennis, 26, said after Andy Cohen asked her on the Monday, May 21, episode of Watch What Happens Live if she had \u201canything to say\u201d regarding the allegations.\n\nDennis and Ravenel, who dated on and off for the first four seasons of the Bravo series, share daughter Kensie, 4, and son Saint, 2. Southern Charm\u2019s Craig Conover also responded to Cohen\u2019s question about the allegations on Monday\u2019s episode.\n\n\u201cAll I know is what I\u2019ve seen in the media, it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to say anything at this point. I\u2019m kind of just \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m where everyone else is,\u201d Conover, 29, explained.\n\nAllegations against Ravenel first surfaced on May 3 when a real estate agent named Ashley Perkins alleged the 55-year-old reality star assaulted her mother, Debbie Holloway Perkins, in December 2015 after they matched on Tinder two months earlier.\n\n\u201cMy mom says, he goes into a trance, and shoves her on the nanny\u2019s bed. He is pulling her pants down, he digitally penetrates my mom in her vagina and butt with his fingers, and my mom is screaming at him to get off of her, and no,\u201d Ashley alleged to Us on May 4. \u201cHe is holding her wrists above her head, which explains the injuries she suffered, and the bruising. My mom screams at him, \u2018You are a rapist.\u2019\u201d\n\nRavenel\u2019s lawyer denied Ashley\u2019s claims on May 3 in statement to Us Weekly: \u201cMy client enjoys a certain degree of fame and unfortunately has become \u2014 unfairly \u2014 a target for an individual who has, in my opinion, dubious motivations.\u201d\n\nA second woman reported Ravenel to Charleston police on May 7 for an alleged incident from January 2015. Ravenel and Dennis\u2019 former nanny, referred to as \u201cNanny Dawn\u201d on Southern Charm, later claimed to People that she was the second alleged victim who spoke to officers about Ravenel, which launched an investigation by South Carolina police. According to the investigation report previously obtained by Us Weekly, the allegations listed in the report included a \u201csex offense\u201d and \u201cforcible rape.\u201d\n\nThe network announced on May 4 that Haymaker, the production company for Southern Charm, is investigating the claims against Ravenel.\n\n\u201cHaymaker, the production company for Southern Charm, and Bravo take allegations like these very seriously,\u201d Bravo said in a statement to Us Weekly. \u201cHaymaker is conducting an investigation, and once all the information is gathered and carefully reviewed, appropriate action will be taken.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
