Check out the clip below.\n\nJohnson previously said that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t rule it out\u201d when asked if he would seek to be President, saying: \u201cIt would be a great opportunity to help people, so it\u2019s possible. This past election shows that anything can happen.\u201d\n\nHe also said that he was \u201cflattered\u201d by frequent questions about running, but that it was \u201ctime to focus on helping people\u201d.\n\nAppearing on last night\u2019s episode of The Graham Norton Show, the Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle star said: \u201cThere\u2019s been this really interesting uptick in public opinion wanting that to happen.\u201d\n\nHe then joked that Jumanji co-star Kevin Hart wouldn\u2019t let a Johnson Presidency become a reality.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that [Hart] will completely sabotage the campaign in 2020, 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll literally sabotage it from the inside.\u201d\n\n\u201c100 percent,\u201d Hart quickly fired back. \u201cI will take you down. I don\u2019t want it to happen because it will make you that much better than me, and I just don\u2019t want it. I would sabotage it in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nJumanji: Welcome To The Jungle \u2013 starring Johnson and Hart \u2013 hits cinemas December 20.
