There are not enough adjectives to describe the light he was, to anyone that ever had the pleasure to meet him. I will miss him everyday, but I know the memory of him will live on. And to his family, I thank them for letting us know him and seeing the joy they brought him. Us crazy ones love you.\u201d\n\nShe also went on to say, \u201cGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/debbi-ryan.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630",
