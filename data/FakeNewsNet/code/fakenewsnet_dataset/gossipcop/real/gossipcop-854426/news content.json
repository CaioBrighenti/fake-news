But when Bailey (Chandra Wilson) puts the hospital on lockdown to find him, Keith resorts to starting a fire to set of the sprinkler system and trigger an automatic release of all the locks in the building.\n\nImage zoom\n\nTo stop Keith from taking a young girl, Erin (Big Little Lies\u2018 Darby Camp), with him as a hostage of sorts, Edwards douses him in flammable liquid and hides with the girl as the rapist becomes engulfed in flames. He sets off a calamity as he stumbles toward flammable tanks in a nearby room. Edwards, rushing to move Keith to a safer location, is too late as the tanks explode and causes a hospital-wide evacuation.\n\nEdwards saves herself and Erin as she reaches the roof of the burning building and quickly begins mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, despite severe burns on her arms, face and legs.\n\nFROM PEN: Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Chandra Wilson Opens Up About Daughter\u2019s Mysterious Vomiting Syndrome \u2014and There\u2019s No Cure\n\nIn the finale, doctors find her and Erin on the roof and quickly rush the young girl into surgery. Edwards, enduring the agony of her wounds and realizing she wants to live her life, tells Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), her mentor, that she won\u2019t be returning to the hospital after she heals.\n\n\u201cI quit,\u201d she says.\n\nBut fans of Hinton need not fear saying goodbye to the actress for long. The 35-year-old has been cast in Six Feet Under and True Blood producer Alan Ball\u2019s upcoming HBO family drama.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy will return in the fall for season 14.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/66479204_108888670282730_6022764772832245612_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C191px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3fa541db8026dac32c501e873a116a3c?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/zendayaeuphoria.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2866px%2C1504.65px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/151975_2580.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/flintstone-social.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/greys-anatomy-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/gettyimages-937971870.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/million1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/lala-kent.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1273px%2C667px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/alec-utgoff-stranger-things-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/teddi-mellencamp.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C1482px%2C777px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/beth-chapman-dog-bounty-hunter-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2026px%2C1063.65px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/nene-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/greys-anatomy-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/sophie-perry-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/rhony1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things-3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/65572421_159177758464737_6055271836865837607_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C366px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-110240357.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bella-chigvintsev-2-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/jenelle-evans.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/60258869_144858413341667_1225242940087715373_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C176px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/oitnb20s720production20still201.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C4500px%2C2362.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/greys-anatomy-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Gomez", "Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/greys-anatomy-season-13-finale-exit/", "title": "Goodbye Dr. ...!
