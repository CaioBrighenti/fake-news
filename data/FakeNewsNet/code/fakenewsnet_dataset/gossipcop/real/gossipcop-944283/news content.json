Galifianakis purposely mixes up Jerry's last name, even going as far as to write that the Seinfeld star was only funny from 1993 to 1997. The Hangover actor quips that the show Seinfeld has \"been a real launching pad for whites\" and calls Seinfeld's Netflix series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee \"lazy, car-based non-comedy.\"\n\nA little after the halfway mark, Galifianakis introduces his next and \"better\" guest, Cardi B, who takes the spotlight away from Seinfeld for the remainder of the interview. Galifianakis gifts Cardi with a gift for her baby, telling the rapper, \"You are special, but the most important thing is that you're relevant.\"\n\nWatch the hilarious interview below:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1529011017/images/Billboard-white.svg?d199a5d3ff5ab03d6d2e", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/troye-sivan-ds-bb15-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/cardi-b-jerry-seinfeld-zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/troye-sivan-ds-bb15-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/879509920/?value=1.00&currency_code=USD&label=wh8cCLa922cQoIOxowM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/cardi-b-jerry-seinfeld-zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1554285401541797&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/cardi-b-jerry-seinfeld-zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nerisha Penrose"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8461038/zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-cardi-b-jerry-seinfeld", "title": "Watch Cardi B Hilariously Crash Jerry Seinfeld's 'Between Two Ferns' Interview With Zach Galifianakis", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Cardi B Crashes Jerry Seinfeld's 'Between Two Ferns' Interview With Jerry Seinfeld: Watch", "description": "Zach Galifianakis's 'Between Two Ferns' Makes Its Return With Hilarious Cardi B & Jerry Seinfeld Interview", "og": {"title": "Watch Cardi B Hilariously Crash Jerry Seinfeld's 'Between Two Ferns' Interview With Zach Galifianakis", "description": "Zach Galifianakis returned with a new episode of his Funny or Die faux talk show Between Two Ferns on Thursday (June 14) and called on Jerry Seinfeld and Cardi B for a hilarious six-minute interview, in which Galiafinakis took aim at Seinfeld and showed hip-hop's golden child (and her unborn child) a whole lot of love.", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/cardi-b-jerry-seinfeld-zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8461038/zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-cardi-b-jerry-seinfeld", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8461038/zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-cardi-b-jerry-seinfeld", "title": "Watch Cardi B Hilariously Crash Jerry Seinfeld's 'Between Two Ferns' Interview With Zach Galifianakis", "description": "Zach Galifianakis returned with a new episode of his Funny or Die faux talk show Between Two Ferns on Thursday (June 14) and called on Jerry Seinfeld and Cardi B for a hilarious six-minute interview, in which Galiafinakis took aim at Seinfeld and showed hip-hop's golden child (and her unborn child) a whole lot of love.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/cardi-b-jerry-seinfeld-zach-galifianakis-between-two-ferns-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180615025109if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qp25FOn37nA"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
