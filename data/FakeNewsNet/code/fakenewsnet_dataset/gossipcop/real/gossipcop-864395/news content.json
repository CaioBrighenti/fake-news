Stars Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park have departed CBS\u2019 \u201cHawaii Five-0.\u201d Their characters, Chin Ho Kelly and Kono Kalakaua, will not appear in the upcoming eighth season. The characters\u2019 absence will be referenced in the season premiere.\n\nSources tell Variety that Park and Kim had been seeking pay equality with stars Alex O\u2019Loughlin and Scott Caan, but were unable to reach satisfactory deals with CBS Television Studios, which produces the series. CBS\u2019s final offer to Kim and Park was believed to have been 10-15% lower than what O\u2019Loughlin and Caan make in salary. O\u2019Laughlin and Caan each have deals that also provide them percentage points on the show\u2019s back end.\n\n\u201cI will never forget meeting Daniel while still writing the pilot and being certain there was no other actor who I\u2019d want to play Chin Ho Kelly,\u201d said executive producer Peter Lenkov. \u201cNeedless to say, Daniel has been an instrumental part of the success of \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 over the past 7 seasons and it has personally been a privilege to know him. Grace\u2019s presence gave \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 a beauty and serenity to each episode. She was the consummate collaborator, helping build her character from day 1. They will always be ohana to us, we will miss them and we wish them both all the best.\u201d\n\nA CBS spokesperson said in a statement: \u201cWe are so appreciative of Daniel and Grace\u2019s enormous talents, professional excellence and the aloha spirit they brought to each and every one of our 168 episodes. They\u2019ve helped us build an exciting new Hawaii Five-0, and we wish them all the best and much success in their next chapters. Mahalo and a hui hou\u2026\u201d\n\nKim and Park have both been cast members on \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d alongside O\u2019Loughlin and Caan since CBS premiered a rebooted version of the classic television cop show in 2010.\n\nThe \u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d changes represent the latest in a series of cast overhauls at returning broadcast dramas.
