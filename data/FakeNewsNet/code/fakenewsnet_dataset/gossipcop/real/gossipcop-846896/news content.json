Music acts Designer, Tyga, and Pusha T.\n\nLate Friday morning, festival organizers postponed the entire event indefinitely.\n\n\u201cFyre Festival set out to provide a once-in-a-lifetime musical experience on the islands of Exuma. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we must postpone this experience,\u201d the event organizers said in a statement. \u201cWe are working tirelessly to ensure each guest leaves the island safely and ask for everyone\u2019s patience and cooperation as we continue to provide ongoing updates via email and our official social media channels as they become available, including refund information.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Noam Galai/WireImage\n\nThe Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, who were not an official sponsor of the event, issued a statement on Friday saying they\u2019re \u201cextremely disappointed with the way the events unfolded\u201d and apologizing to \u201call who traveled to our country for this event.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first poorly executed business venture from Ja Rule\u2019s business partner, McFarland. The tech entrepreneur previously founded Magnises, an \u201celite credit\u201d card that had a $250 annual fee for discounted access to exclusive events \u2014 but customers claim that the card never delivered on the perks it was advertising.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jake-gyllenhaal-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630",
