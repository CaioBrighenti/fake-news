(Attendees signed non-disclosure agreements forbidding them from describing the album in detail.) While addressing the crowd before the album played, Timberlake \u2014 wearing a wool cap, flannel shirt and Nikes \u2014 spoke again of the album\u2019s \u201cpersonal\u201d nature and the inspiration he received from his family and 2-year-old son Silas, joking that \u201cI\u2019m not going to go all Ray LaMontagne,\u201d referring to the singer-songwriter and labelmate known for his moody, organic sound.\n\nHis wife Jessica Biel and various members of Timberlake\u2019s family were present, along with members of the media, music industry, and American Express cardholders who\u2019d won a competition for tickets. As the evening wound down, wait staff could be heard explaining the menu items to attendees, one of them saying patiently, \u201cYes, ants.\u201d\n\nThe album\u2019s first single and lead-off track, \u201cFilthy,\u201d dropped on Jan. 4, and three more songs are scheduled to arrive every week beginning this Friday, leading up to the album\u2019s Feb. 2 arrival and his appearance as the Super Bowl halftime entertainment on Feb. 4.\n\nAnother New York listening party is scheduled for Wednesday night, and one will take place at Prince\u2019s Paisley Park Studios in Minneapolis during Super Bowl Week.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
