So why did Javi and Briana break up? Bri said their futures \"didn't line up,\" and that explanation would have been frustratingly vague if she had stopped there. But then Bri got much more specific, saying he didn't approve of her going under the knife.\n\n\"Javi and I are not together anymore,\" Briana told Blasting News in January. \"Our future just doesn't line up. He doesn't want me to get my surgery for a breast lift, lipo, and tummy tuck \u2026 because it'll look bad on his name at work. Also, I don't plan on moving in with him in the summer, and for these reasons, he broke up with me.\"\n\nBriana elaborated even further, adding, \"I have no bad things to say to about him. He wanted a wife and home right now, and I didn't see a reason to rush. I wish him the best going forward, and I am sad things panned out this way, but this is where things currently stand. Again, we are no longer together.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Javi's statement to Radar Online mostly corroborated Bri's version of events, though he did say the surgery itself \"wasn't the issue.\" He explained, \"Some questions about our futures couldn't be answered because we both do have kids and live two different lifestyles, her being in Florida and me in Delaware. I didn't agree with some of her future plans being exposed for the world to see for our future and any future employers, and I wish we could've compromised. Maybe I was overthinking, but I couldn't figure out a way to answer some of those questions \u2026 Bri is an amazing person with the biggest heart I've ever got to hold. Everything she goes through and she's still selfless and does her best to please others. She's got a bright future, and she'll make any guy feel special.\"\n\nAfter the breakup, fans thought Briana was pregnant with Javi's baby, but that speculation seems unfounded these days. In fact, Javi is about to be a father again now that new girlfriend Lauren Comeau is pregnant. And Bri is being gracious about that surprising news. \"I'm happy for them,\" she told Us Weekly earlier this week. \"I wish them nothing but the best. All he wanted was a family, and he got it. So, good for him. Like I said, I'm sending my best wishes and have no hard feelings.\"\n\nThe lady (and the Javi) doth protest too much, we think. It wouldn't be surprising at all if the breakup wasn't as amicable as they're making it out to be!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/why-did-javi-and-briana-break-up.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/javi-and-briana.jpg?w=1180#038;h=530&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/why-did-javi-and-briana-break-up.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mike-and-Laura-Fleiss.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jade-Cline.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/David-Eason-Dog-Killing-Jenelle-Denies-Nugget-Shot-Promo.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Teen-Mom-OG-Amber-Portwood-Domestic-Violence-Incident-11.jpg?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/why-did-javi-and-briana-break-up.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Clarendon", "Jun"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/why-did-javi-and-briana-break-up-161103/", "title": "Why Did Javi and Briana Break Up?
