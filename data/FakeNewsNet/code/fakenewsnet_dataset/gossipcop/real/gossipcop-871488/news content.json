He\u2019s not kidding. On the night of Trump\u2019s election victory, \u201cI just drank, \u201che says. \u201cI drank a lot of bourbon onscreen. We didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Dave Chappelle Tells Stephen Colbert He Never \u2018Wanted\u2019 To Give Trump A Chance\n\nIn the interview, Colbert gets serious to discuss how he struggled with panic attacks, which led to what he now describes as a \u201cnervous breakdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my late 20s, early 30s, I had a nervous breakdown,\u201d he says. \u201cI was subject to panic attacks and stuff like that except when I was onstage. I would curl up in a ball on a couch backstage, and then I\u2019d hear my cue coming up, and I would uncurl, go onstage, do the show, and then go offstage and curl up again.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Arcade Fire Send List Of Crazy Demands To Stephen Colbert\n\nColbert also talks about travelling to Russia for what turned out to be some classic \u201cLate Show\u201d bits, but admits he was initially resistant to the idea.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t want to do that. I really don\u2019t wanna do that.\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d he tells InStyle. \u201cThere\u2019s enough pressure with these jobs. You know, I kind of like doing theatre, doing my monologue, talking with guests, going home, having an old-fashioned, eating some cashews, and watching Anderson Cooper with my wife.\u201d\n\nHowever, the short trip saw Colbert and his crew working at a breakneck pace, which he admits required a little help from his pharmacist.\n\n\u201cAmerican pharmaceutical companies are fantastic,\u201d he jokes. \u201cThey give you pills so you can go to sleep at night, and there\u2019s another pill so you\u2019re awake the next day. The toxicology report on me is going to be fascinating.\u201d\n\nWhile Colbert\u2019s main mission is to make his viewers laugh, he sees himself as a sort of comedy conduit to help them digest the news of the day. \u201cI care about the news, I care about what\u2019s happening, and I love jokes, so to be able to say to the audience, \u2018Come over here, and we\u2019ll hopefully explain it to you in a different way and make you laugh about it\u2019 \u2014 that is an absolute joy,\u201d he says.\n\nYou can read more with Colbert in the latest issue of InStyle.\n\n\u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT on Global.
