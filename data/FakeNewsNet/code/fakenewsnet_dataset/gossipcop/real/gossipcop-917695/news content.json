How are you going to deal with that?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019ll be tough for you?\u201d the publicist asks her beau, who says, \u201cNo, that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve done my entire life.\u201d\n\nThough he praises Kufrin for always being \u201cvery confident and patient\u201d with him throughout filming the ABC reality series, she admits to internalizing her true feelings \u2014 and calls fellow Bachelor finalist Lauren Burnham a \u201cthreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis entire process Arie keeps saying that I\u2019ve seemed so confident, but the fact is, I internally am freaking out because there is one other girl here still. And she is a huge threat to me,\u201d Kufrin says about the 26-year-old sales executive.\n\n\u201cAt this point it\u2019s hard for me to even say Lauren\u2019s name because I don\u2019t want to acknowledge his relationship with anyone else,\u201d she shares. \u201cBut I have to ask him tonight: is he in love with two people at this point?\u201d\n\nWATCH: The Bachelor\u2019s Arie Luyendyk Jr. Says He Fell for Two Women on the Show\n\nThough PEOPLE won\u2019t reveal specific plot points so as not to spoil the upcoming drama, suffice it to say that after the two-part finale on Monday and Tuesday, the ABC leading man will have a lot of explaining to do \u2014 especially since the franchise has been dropping ominous hints that something no one expected is about to go down.\n\n\u201cI know people are going to be hard on [me],\u201d Luyendyk Jr. told PEOPLE exclusively in this week\u2019s issue. \u201cI made a mistake. And I\u2019m prepared for the backlash. But all I can say is I had to follow my heart.\u201d\n\nOf his two finalists, the race car driver said they\u2019re \u201cvery different\u201d: Minnesota-based Kufrin is \u201coutgoing,\u201d while Burnham, who lives in Virginia Beach, is more \u201creserved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both great in their own individual ways,\u201d he added.\n\nThe three-hour season finale of The Bachelor airs Monday at 9 p.m. ET, with the live two-hour After the Final Rose special airing Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET, both on ABC.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052044im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052044im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052044im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/bachelor2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052044im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052044im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052044im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/bachelor2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180303052044/http://people.com/tv/bachelor-becca-kufrin-lauren-burnham-huge-threat/", "title": "The Bachelor: Becca K.
