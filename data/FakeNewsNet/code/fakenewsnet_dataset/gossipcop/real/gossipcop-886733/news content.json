So it\u2019s pretty self explanatory, obviously.\u201d\n\nAfter introducing herself as \u201cHollywood\u2019s Kate Hudson from Almost Famous and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and Kung Fu Panda 3,\u201d the actress demonstrated a few recipes from her upcoming entertaining book, Pretty Fun: ginger-thyme margaritas and amped-up popcorn. Naturally, DeGeneres wouldn\u2019t let her get away without taste-testing her handy work.\n\nWATCH: This Bacon Fat Popcorn Hack Will Revolutionize Your Movie Nights\n\n\u201cThe number one rule for all of it is to make sure the host has the best time. So before your guests arrive I like to get really, really drunk,\u201d Hudson says while DeGeneres forces her to drink a few glugs of tequila.\n\nRELATED: Watch Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey Go Grocery Shopping for the First Time in \u2018Years\u2019\n\nWant the ultimate dish on the latest celebrity food news, plus exclusive recipes, videos and more?
