Prince Harry Has Some Thoughts\n\nThe royal newlyweds may still be basking in their honeymoon glow, but of course people are already wondering if Prince Harry and Meghan Markle want kids. When pressed by fans, the Prince has made it clear exactly how many kids is too many, but that doesn\u2019t mean babies won\u2019t be part of the couple\u2019s future.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have already been forthcoming about wanting to have a family. During their first interview with the BBC after getting engaged, they were questioned about having kids and Prince Harry responded,\u201dI think one step at a time and hopefully we\u2019ll start a family in the near future.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe question is, exactly how many kids? With big brother Prince William having recently welcomed his third child, is a big family on the horizon for Prince William as well? It might be, but there\u2019s a definitely a limit as one fan learned.\n\nDuring the couple\u2019s recent visit to Dublin, Prince Harry was greeting fans when one mom, Elaine Adam-Stewart, pressed him on their future plans. Adam-Stewart told the Prince that she and her redheaded husband have five kids and asked, \u201cWhen are you and Meghan going to get going?\u201d Recalling the moment to PEOPLE, Adam-Stewart said \u201cHe laughed and said, \u2018five children?\u2014too many,\u2019.\u201d\n\nFive might be out of the question, but we can\u2019t wait until Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis have a new cousin to play with.\n\n\u2014Shahrzad Warkentin\n\nFeatured Photo: Kensington Royal via Instagram\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nDoes Meghan Markle Want Kids with Prince Harry?
