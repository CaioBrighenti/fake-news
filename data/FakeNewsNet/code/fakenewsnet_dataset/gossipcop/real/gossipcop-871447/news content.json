In another photo, the proud dad, 32, smiles and holds Dalton, who is swaddled in a blanket and wearing a hat, at the hospital. The whole family also poses together for a selfie with Monroe laying in the hospital bed and holding her bundle of joy.\n\nThe Pistol Annies singer previously revealed that she was pregnant on Christmas Day 2016 by sharing a photo of her ultrasound on Instagram. \u201cBest present ever. Merry Christmas everyone,\u201d she captioned the post. \u201cSo many new things coming in 2017!\u201d In March, she revealed that she was expecting a boy by baring her bump in a bikini and pointing to a blue \u201cBaby Boy\u201d sign.\n\nMonroe and Danks wed in an intimate ceremony at the luxurious Blackberry Farm in Walland, Tennessee, in 2013. The singer\u2019s BFF Miranda Lambert served as the maid of honor and wedding planner, while Lambert\u2019s then-husband Blake Shelton officiated the ceremony. \u201cI am the happiest I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life,\u201d Monroe told Us Weekly at the time.\n\nIt seems that Monroe may be back in the studio soon with her Pistol Annies bandmates Lambert, 33, and Angaleena Presley.
