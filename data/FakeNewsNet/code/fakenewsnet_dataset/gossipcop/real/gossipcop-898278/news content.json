{"url": "https://variety.com/2017/dirt/real-estalker/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-tennessee-retreat-1202630589/", "text": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are not the buyers of an opulent, $39 million New York City townhouse mansion, as was widely reported in property gossip columns around the globe last week \u2014 but they are the sellers of a rustic-luxe rural retreat about half an hour outside Nashville, listed at $3.45 million. The Honolulu-born Australian actress and Oscar winner, most recently nominated for her supporting role in \u201cLion,\u201d and the platinum-selling New Zealand-born country music superstar purchased the almost 36-acre, two-parcel spread in two 2007 transactions that totaled $2.45 million.\n\nA long drive meanders through a pristine stand of woods and swoops across an open field as it makes its way to the front of a red-brick residence with four bedrooms and four full and two half bathrooms in not quite 5,100 square feet. The traditional exterior belies the clean-lined, open-plan and decidedly modern interior spaces that include a steeply pitched vaulted and skylight-pierced ceiling in the living room, a stainless steel-accented fireplace in the family room and a window-lined dining room that flows into a galley-style kitchen with speckled granite counters on stainless steel cabinets.\n\nBedrooms are well separated for privacy, and include a top-floor master suite that comprises a sitting room, separate bedroom, luxury bathroom and immense walk-in closet perfect for a couple of frequent red-carpet walkers. Along with several guest bedrooms and a den, the lower level has a large fitness room and a small office that open to the yard. A separate cottage works well for guests, a caretaker or live-in domestic staff.\n\nIn addition to substantial holdings in and around Sydney, the Kidman-Urbans\u2019 property portfolio includes a palatial, 12,000-plus-square-foot mansion in Nashville landed in 2008 for $3.47 million; a contemporary Beverly Hills home scooped up in 2008 for $4.75 million; and a snazzy duplex condo in lower Manhattan\u2019s West Chelsea.\n\nlisting photos: French King Fine Properties", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
