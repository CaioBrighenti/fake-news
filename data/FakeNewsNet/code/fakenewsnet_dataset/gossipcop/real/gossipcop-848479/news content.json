(Published Wednesday, June 15, 2016)\n\nLena Dunham broke her silence Thursday about a health scare after being rushed to the hospital following the 2017 Met Gala earlier this week.\n\nIn an Instagram post the \"Girls\" creator and star reveals she suffered complications from her most recent endometriosis surgery. The actress said last month she had undergone her fifth procedure to treat the disorder, a female reproductive disease in which abnormal tissue grows outside the uterus and could cause infertility.\n\nThank you for all the love & concern that's been pouring in since Tuesday. Although I'm much healthier than I was a year ago, complications arose from my most recent endometriosis surgery. When the healthcare of so many American women, especially our trans sisters, is at-risk- or already nonexistent- I am lucky to be in the position to seek help when I'm in pain. To those in that privileged spot- never forget that we are blessed and can pay it forward by supporting Planned Parenthood and LGBTQ clinics like Callen-Lorde with our \ud83d\udcb0 and \u231a\ufe0f. I also want to remind all the women suffering from chronic illness that we aren't weak- quite the opposite, actually. We do our jobs with skill even when we're struggling. We care families even when we can hardly care for ourselves. We serve major face on a red carpet when we feel like lying face down would be more appropriate. I'll always be proud of those Met Gala pics- not just because I felt beautiful, surrounded by art and magic, hugging my best friend tightly, but because they're evidence that women contain steely multitudes. Just that morning @dianafalzone sued Fox after they took her off air for disclosing her endometriosis. But they're the ones who lost when they fired her, because everyone who's anyone knows that if you can battle chronic illness there's nothing you can't take on.

News the actress was hospitalized after the Met Gala and then released after completing a series of tests, adding, \"She's at home resting and doing well. As you know she's very public about her battles with endometriosis.\"\n\nDunham did not reveal what type of surgery she had undergone or the complications she suffered as a result. A common procedure to remove the endometriosis include a laparoscopy with an excision through the abdomen. Risks include bleeding, blood clots, damage to bowels, bladder and other organs, the formation of scarring and infection.\n\nDunham did, however, take the opportunity to get political.\n\n\"When the healthcare of so many American women, especially our trans sisters, is at-risk- or already nonexistent- I am lucky to be in the position to seek help when I'm in pain,\" she wrote. \"To those in that privileged spot- never forget that we are blessed and can pay it forward by supporting Planned Parenthood and LGBTQ clinics like Callen-Lorde with our [money bag emoji] and [clock emoji].
