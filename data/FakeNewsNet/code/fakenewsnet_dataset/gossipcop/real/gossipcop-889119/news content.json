Instagram/misskarenelson\n\nAmerican talent manager Guy Oseary and Brazilian model Michelle Alves renewed their wedding vows at a ridiculously star-studded bash in one of the most extravagant settings in the world on October 24.\n\nThe couple first married in 2006, and are understood to have renewed vows this week in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe series of events began with a pre-wedding meeting for their A-list guests, according to sources on social media, and culminated in a lavish feast and reception party at the mansion of Brazilian TV show host Luciano Huck and his wife Angelica, an eyewitness told E Online.\n\nThe likes of Madonna and U2 \u2014 who were both managed by Oseary \u2014 Diddy, Cassie, Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore, Chris Rock, Matthew McConaughey, Dakota Johnson, Helena Christensen, Owen Wilson, Anthony Kiedis, and Caetano Veloso were all in attendance.\n\nAnd they were certainly taken care of.\n\nThe couple apparently hired out the exclusive five-star Fasano Hotel in Ipanema\u2014 which has unrivalled views of the iconic Dois Irm\u00e3os mountains \u2014 for their guests to stay at.\n\nThe ceremony apparently began at 5.p.m. at the top of the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue on Corcovado mountain, 2,329 feet up in the air, amidst the clouds and the mist \u2014 which made for a rather dramatic backdrop.\n\nOseary is Jewish, and the wedding party even managed to erect a chuppah at the high-up venue. It was a Kabbalah wedding, according to E Online.\n\nA-list guests included Bono, Helena Christensen, and Dakota Johnson, captured here at the Fasano Hotel by jewellery designer Jennifer Meyer.\n\nThe entire U2 band appeared to fly in for the celebrations.\n\nHere, some of the guests including Diddy and Sacha Baron Cohen assume the same pose as Christ himself.\n\nMadonna attended the ceremony with her kids.\n\nShe was later spotted guarding the Champagne at the reception \u2014 once she had swapped her floral dress for a Moschino jacket adorned with dollar signs.\n\nThe bride's structured off-white dress \u2014 designed by Zac Posen \u2014 was made of silk and had sleeves and a long train.\n\nThe groom opted for a classic linen suit and chilled white shirt with no tie.\n\nThe reception was hosted by Brazilian TV show host Luciano Huck and his wife Angelica at their private mansion. She wore a red Stella McCartney dress.\n\nHelena Christensen and Dakota Johnson posed together for selfies at the bash.\n\nAhead of the big day, Oseary posted a throwback photo of Alves on Instagram with the caption: \"Today is a special day in my life.. My marriage to my Brazilian princess.. A new and exciting chapter begins in just a few hours..
