After months of watching Netflix\u2019s Sabrina reboot slowly come together, we finally have our first official look at Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina Spellman\u2026and she looks like she stepped right out of the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina comics.\n\nTaking to Twitter to reveal that the Netflix series will *also* be called Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa gave us a glimpse of the former Mad Men star in action as the titular teen witch. The photo features a fully costumed Shipka perched on the director\u2019s chair, looking over her shoulder.\n\nWhile Shipka\u2019s Sabrina looks like the sweetest teen witch in all the land, the photo is full of hints of the darkness to come. If the dark shadows and creepy Chilling Adventures of Sabrina font embossed on the back of the director\u2019s chair aren\u2019t enough, Aguirre-Sacasa\u2019s tweet makes it pretty clear the upcoming series is something out of our teen horror dreams.\n\n\"It\u2019s official! 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' is our title!\"Aguirre-Sacasa tweeted. \"Something wicked this way comes\u2026\"\n\nFirst the Carrie musical episode of Riverdale and now the first official Sabrina photo? What did we do to deserve this magic?\n\nUnlike its comedic TV predecessor, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, which starred Melissa Joan Hart is as the titular teen, the upcoming Netflix series is going to be pretty dark, having been described as \u201ca dark coming-of-age story that traffics in horror, the occult and, of course, witchcraft.\u201d The series, which was picked up by Netflix for a two-season, 20-episode order, has even been compared to Rosemary\u2019s Baby and The Exorcist, tonally. Yep, we\u2019re going to be sleeping with one eye open after watching this one.\n\nThe first official portrait of Shipka as Sabrina comes just weeks after Aguirre-Sacasa tweeted a previously leaked on-set photo of Shipka and Ross Lynch in costume as Sabrina and her boyfriend, Harvey.\n\nWell, it\u2019s out there. A 1st look at Harvey and Sabrina from the \u201cChilling Adventures of #Sabrina.\u201d ADORBS, right? pic.twitter.com/9n8cznpv2c \u2014 RobertoAguirreSacasa (@WriterRAS) April 4, 2018\n\nThe series also stars Lucy Davis as Hilda Spellman, Miranda Otto as Zelda Spellman, Jaz Sinclair as Rosalind Walker, and Michelle Gomez as Mary Wardell. But don\u2019t fret, Salem the cat will also be making an appearance in the series.\n\nEven though we know it will inevitably give us nightmares, we can\u2019t wait for The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina to premiere on Netflix!", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12083149/gina-rodriguez-president-e1562945522927.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/26132638/billie-body-hair.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/19100520/janet-mock-e1560963933376.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02101219/couple-in-bed-e1562087559934.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27090221/Democratic-Debates-Elizabeth-Warren.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12092117/Friends-Pottery-Barn.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01095134/Natural-Hair.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10114259/us-womens-national-team-e1562784596987.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02080120/aoc-border-patrol-facebook-e1562079691898.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/13090025/Stranger-Things-Season-3.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072542/avatar-g-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/07/17235516/Sansa-e1541615562785.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11093957/camile-mendes-lucy-hale-new-e1562863206330.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/03112232/new-jersey-rape-case-e1562178162466.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/24090011/gofundme-abortion-rights-campaign-e1561392026799.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11125306/kamala-harris-rape-kits-e1562874800780.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27065900/amy-klobuchar-first-debate-e1561643949698.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27095856/Cory-Booker.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02092501/ama-abortion-laws-e1562084712895.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28115616/dalai-lama-e1561748186500.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/02104634/sabrina.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09071547/amy-mcgrath-e1562681757171.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/02104634/sabrina.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meaghan Kirby"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/sabrina-netflix-official-set-picture/", "title": "The first official picture from Netflix's new \"Sabrina\" is here \u2014 and yes, we've got *chills*", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "chilling adventures of sabrina,netflix,Riverdale,roberto Aguirre-Sacasa,Sabrina reboot,sabrina spellman,TV Shows", "news_keywords": "chilling adventures of sabrina,netflix,Riverdale,roberto Aguirre-Sacasa,Sabrina reboot,sabrina spellman,TV Shows", "description": "It's official, the Netflix \"Sabrina\" reboot will officially be called \"The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,\" and we even have our first look at Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina Spellman.", "og": {"title": "The first official picture from Netflix's new \"Sabrina\" is here \u2014 and yes, we've got *chills*", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/sabrina-netflix-official-set-picture/", "description": "Things are about to get more chilling!", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/02104634/sabrina.jpg", "width": 768, "height": 1366}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/sabrina-netflix-official-set-picture/", "description": "It's official, the Netflix \"Sabrina\" reboot will officially be called \"The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,\" and we even have our first look at Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina Spellman.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/02104634/sabrina.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/sabrina-netflix-official-set-picture/", "title": "The first official picture from Netflix's new \"Sabrina\" is here \u2014 and yes, we've got *chills*", "description": "Things are about to get more chilling!", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/02104634/sabrina.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
