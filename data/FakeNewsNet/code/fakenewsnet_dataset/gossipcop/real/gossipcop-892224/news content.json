However, these past few days, just before my first concerts, have been some of the hardest of my career,\" she said of the recently developed strain on her right vocal cord. \"Unfortunately the hemorrhage doesn\u2019t appear to have reabsorbed and my nightmare continues. At the moment I find myself in a difficult battle as I try to fully recover.\"\n\nShe added: \"It pains me not to be able to sing this month, for those have done even the impossible to get tickets and accompany me throughout the different countries of Europe.\"\n\nShakira went on to thank her team, family members and especially her fans for understanding and sticking by her though the good and bad. In the end, she confirmed she will not be touring until further notice.\n\n\"As such, and with a heavy heart, I must announce that I find myself obliged to postpone my European tour until 2018, to allow my body several necessary weeks, dedicated to my complete recovery.\"\n\nRead her statement in Spanish below, and her full statement in English here.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/shakira-ap-portrait-may-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/shakira-ap-portrait-may-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marjua Estevez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8038219/shakira-cancels-european-tour-vocal-cord-hemorrage-instagram-post", "title": "Shakira Forced To Cancel European Tour Due to Vocal Cord Hemorrhage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Shakira Cancels European Tour Due to Vocal Cord Hemorrhage", "description": "After announcing the cancellation of her El Dorado Tour's opening concert (Nov. 8), and postponing four other shows thereafter, Shakira is forced to postpone all European tour stops to rest and fully recover from a suffered hemorrhage on her vocal cords.", "og": {"title": "Shakira Forced To Cancel European Tour Due to Vocal Cord Hemorrhage", "description": "After announcing the cancellation of her El Dorado Tour's opening concert (Nov. 8), and postponing four other shows thereafter, Shakira is forced to postpone all European tour stops to rest and fully recover from a suffered hemorrhage on her vocal cords.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/shakira-ap-portrait-may-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8038219/shakira-cancels-european-tour-vocal-cord-hemorrage-instagram-post", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8038219/shakira-cancels-european-tour-vocal-cord-hemorrage-instagram-post", "title": "Shakira Forced To Cancel European Tour Due to Vocal Cord Hemorrhage", "description": "After announcing the cancellation of her El Dorado Tour's opening concert (Nov. 8), and postponing four other shows thereafter, Shakira is forced to postpone all European tour stops to rest and fully recover from a suffered hemorrhage on her vocal cords.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/shakira-ap-portrait-may-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
