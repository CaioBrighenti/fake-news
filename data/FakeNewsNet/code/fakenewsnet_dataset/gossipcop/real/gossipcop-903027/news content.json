Now she's sharing more details about injuries she sustained.\n\nIn a blog post to fans on New Year's Day, Underwood said she suffered a facial injury that required 40-50 stitches, and she's \"still healing and not quite looking the same.\"\n\nShe expressed her gratitude to the people who have been helping her heal and said she was grateful that it wasn't \"much much worse.\"\n\nHowever, she cautioned fans that she might not look the same when she's ready to be seen on camera again.\n\n\"I'm hoping that, by then, the differences are minimal, but, again, I just don't know how it's all going to end up.\"\n\nUnderwood said she'll be in the studio next week.\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC 7 San Diego", "images": ["https://s.clickability.com/s?19=990&14=0&6=467606813&7=1222356&25=0&18=0.5007976870453466", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/images/1200*675/carrieGettyImages-871835824.jpg", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/designimages/ots_light_wx_98.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/images/tve-play-icon.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/nbc-ajax-loader.gif", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/images/652*367/carrieGettyImages-871835824.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/images/620*349/GettyImages-07122.jpg", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/tlmd-sandiego_1x.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/logo_sd_2x.png", "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/designimages/us-world-v1.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/ots-double-arrow.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=493885794104352&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/images/1200*675/carrieGettyImages-871835824.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/Singer-Carrie-Underwood-Also-Injured-Her-face-in-Fall-467606813.html", "title": "Carrie Underwood Needed More Than 40 Stitches After Fall", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140, user-scalable=yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 96971132149, "pages": 67801524608}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "NBC 7 San Diego", "description": "Country singer Carrie Underwood is ready to say goodbye to 2017.\n\nUnderwood broke her wrist following a hard fall outside the steps of her Nashville home in November.
