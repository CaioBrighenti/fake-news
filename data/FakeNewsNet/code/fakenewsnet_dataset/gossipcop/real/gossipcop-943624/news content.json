She introduced the suitors to her family, but they weren\u2019t much help. Her sister told her Garrett was \u201cincredible,\u201d adding, \u201cI felt like I had known him for years.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting Blake, her sister liked him, too, saying, \u201cI feel like Blake would challenge you and he would be more of a teammate. You just need to decide what you want.\u201d\n\nFrom there, it was time for the romantic final dates in the Maldives.\n\nAt the end of their date, Garrett gushed, \u201cI know that you\u2019re the person that I need in my life to make me be a better version of myself every day, but I want to make sure that I\u2019m the person that does that to you as well. So when you make that decision, I\u2019m willing to be absolutely crushed at the end of this, even if it isn\u2019t me, just as long as you\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\nAfter Becca\u2019s date with Blake, it seemed she might choose him instead. She said, \u201cFor a while, I\u2019ve been in love with Blake. He always surprises me. He\u2019s so good at everything. He makes me laugh, he has great conversation, he stimulates me, he\u2019s romantic. He\u2019s really everything I could want in a partner.\u201d\n\nBefore the breakup and proposal, Becca took a moment to explain where she\u2019s coming from, \u201cI feel like I could be happy with either guy and both of them would be a right choice for me. But I\u2019m going for the one that I can\u2019t see myself without. This love feels like it just fits my soul, it just fits my heart.\u201d\n\nWhen it was time for the breakup, Becca let Blake down as gently as she could.\n\nShe told him, \u201cYou have been the most solid, constant relationship and one that I could turn to anytime. I knew that you\u2019d be there and you\u2019d be a partner to me \u2014 and a teammate. You\u2019ve made me know that I can fall in love again.\u201d\n\nBecca goes on to tell him, \u201cI think that there\u2019s just a better fit for us out there.\u201d\n\nBlake was devastated and speechless for a moment. He told her he loves her and that she\u2019s making a mistake, before admitting he knew this was how it would end.\n\nThe show ended with the moment fans had been waiting for\u2026 the proposal!\n\nWhen Garrett joined Becca on the beach she told him, \u201cYou got that first impression rose because right away I felt something so strong. I re-read my journal and you were the first guy I ever wrote about in it. I wrote that you reminded me of home, and you reminded me one of the most important men in my life entire life and that was my dad.\u201d\n\nAfter she professed her love for Garrett, he popped the question, and she said yes!\n\nBecca and Garrett have been making headlines for months. In May, TMZ posted photos of Becca kissing a man that bore a strong resemblance to Garrett.\n\nHe also sparked controversy over his questionable likes on Instagram. The proposal took place before those social media likes came to light.\n\nOf the backlash surrounding Garrett, Becca told \u201cExtra\u201d in May, \u201cEveryone has an opinion \u2014 that\u2019s what is so great about our country. People are entitled to their own beliefs.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThat being said, I want to go through that entire journey with people \u2013 open to me and open to all the 28 men\u2026 I hope that after watching the entire season play out, they can stay open and get to know the guys for who they are.\u201d\n\nCheck out our past interviews with Becca and the stars of Bachelor Nation below!", "images": ["https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/michael-strahan-getty-510x600.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/10/connorj-300x211.jpeg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/09/jay-leno-bravo-510x600.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/05/16/elle-fanning-mega-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/11/jd-scott-splash-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/11/05/lester-holt-getty-1-825x580.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/08/06/becca-garrett-blake-abc-825x580.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/cameron-boyce-insta-300x211.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000013&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/02/28/ed-sheeran-cherry-seaborn-insta-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/08/06/becca-garrett-blake-abc-1200x630.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/04/12/gettyimages-1141083562-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/10/extra-morningsave-sidebar-hp-placement-300x190-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/06/24/mary-j-blige-splash-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/10/john-f-kennedy-jr-carolyn-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/diane-keaton-splash-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/michael-strahan-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/08/06/bachelorette-abc-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2017/05/05/jack-schlossberg-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/05/07/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-getty-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/07/24/jason-tartwick-abc-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/09/melissa-peterman-splash-300x211.jpg", "http://warnerbros.112.2o7.net/b/ss/wbrosshowextra/1/JS-1.5.1--NS/s1562998413?AQB=1&ce=UTF-8&ns=warnerbros&pageName=articles%3Aarticle%3A%3Athe-bachelorette-finale-who-did-becca-kufrin-choose&c1=Extra.us&v1=Extra.us&c2=article&v2=article&c3=articles&v3=articles&events=event6&AQE=1", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/07/30/becca-kufrin-abc-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/09/05/christopher-lawford-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2018/06/04/becca-kufrin-garrett-abc-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/08/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-backgrid-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/06/18/demi-380x447.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/11/nikki-bella-artem-getty-300x211.jpg", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/12/larissa-lima-mega-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/07/11/danica-mckellar-gilbert-flores-broadimage-300x211.jpg", "https://media.extratv.com/2019/06/26/kylie-insta-380x447.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.extratv.com/2018/08/06/becca-garrett-blake-abc-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://extratv.com/2018/08/06/the-bachelorette-finale-who-did-becca-kufrin-choose/", "title": "'The Bachelorette' Finale: Who Did Becca Kufrin Choose?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"extratv": 15676578, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@extratv", "title": "'The Bachelorette' Finale: Who Did Becca Kufrin Choose?", "description": "Becca Kufrin has found the one!", "image": "https://media.extratv.com/2018/08/06/becca-garrett-blake-abc-1200x630.jpg"}, "msvalidate.01": "0E70C51413A3322437EB864B93EEBD17", "keywords": "becca kufrin, garrett, blake, rose, the bachelorette, finale", "description": "Becca Kufrin has found the one!", "robots": "index,follow", "og": {"url": "https://extratv.com/2018/08/06/the-bachelorette-finale-who-did-becca-kufrin-choose/", "site_name": "Extra", "type": "article", "title": "'The Bachelorette' Finale: Who Did Becca Kufrin Choose?", "description": "Becca Kufrin has found the one!", "image": "https://media.extratv.com/2018/08/06/becca-garrett-blake-abc-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 18489729593, "pages": 26676834754}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLmZGUEYglL9tWKCaerqrPWA-yC8mum6S1"], "publish_date": 1533528000.0, "source": "http://extratv.com", "summary": ""}
