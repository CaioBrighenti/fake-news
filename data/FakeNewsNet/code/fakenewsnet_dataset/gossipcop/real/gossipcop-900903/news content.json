The \"Tommy Boy\" star may have left us physically on December 18, 1997 ... but his comedic legacy will always stay with us.\n\nIn honor of the legendary entertainer, we had to go back and remember some of his greatest moments, in no particular order.\n\nTommy Boy\n\n\"Tommy Boy\" brought us great lines like \"fat guy in a little coat,\" and one of Farley's most memorable bits about being in sales.\n\nMatt Foley: The Motivational Speaker\n\nIf you've never heard of this famous Farley sketch, then there's a good chance you'll end up ... LIVING IN A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER!!!\n\nChippendales\n\nThe famous sketch with Patrick Swayze will go down as one of Saturday Night Live's best, although many friends of Farley have said since his death they felt the sketch was painful for him.\n\nBilly Madison\n\nThe angry bus driver was one of the funniest parts in \"Billy Madison.\" \"No Yelling on the bus!!!\"\n\nGap Girls\n\nWatching Adam Sandler try to hold himself together when Farley belts out his infamous \"Lay off me I'm starving\" line is pure gold.\n\nBonus: Schmitts Gay\n\nI know we said five, but Chris Farley is so amazing that it could hardly be limited. We could keep going, but this classic SNL commercial should never be left off a list.\n\nR.I.P Chris -- we miss you.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035223&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://theblast.com/static/theblast/logo.svg", "https://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1218_Chris-Farley-Article.jpg?auto=format"], "top_img": "https://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1218_Chris-Farley-Article.jpg?auto=format", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/5-amazing-chris-farley-moments-well-never-forget-on-20th-anniversary-of-death", "title": "5 Amazing Chris Farley Moments We'll Never Forget 20 Years After His Death", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "theme-color": "#f60", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "5 Amazing Chris Farley Moments We'll Never Forget, 20 Years After Death", "url": "https://theblast.com/c/5-amazing-chris-farley-moments-well-never-forget-on-20th-anniversary-of-death", "site_name": "The Blast", "description": "In honor of the legendary entertainer, we had to go back and remember some of his greatest moments, in no particular order.", "image": {"identifier": "/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1218_Chris-Farley-Article.jpg?auto=format", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2017-12-18T11:34:33.000+00:00"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2019-06-10T23:05:00.000+00:00", "published_time": "2017-12-18T11:34:33.000+00:00", "section": "News", "tag": "David Spade", "publisher": "https://facebook.com/theblastnews"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBlastNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "5 Amazing Chris Farley Moments We'll Never Forget, 20 Years After Death", "description": "In honor of the legendary entertainer, we had to go back and remember some of his greatest moments, in no particular order.", "image": "https://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1218_Chris-Farley-Article.jpg"}, "description": "In honor of the legendary entertainer, we had to go back and remember some of his greatest moments, in no particular order.", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/theblast/icon-270.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513596873.0, "source": "https://theblast.com", "summary": ""}
