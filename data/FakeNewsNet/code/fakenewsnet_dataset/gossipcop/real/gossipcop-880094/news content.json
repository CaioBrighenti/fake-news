The biggest stars in television make sure to pull out all the style stops on the carpet. And leading up to the show, celebs tap their army of stylists, makeup artists, estheticians and hair stylists to get them primped and ready to go for biggest night in television. Everyone from Heidi Klum to Oprah can\u2019t help but share behind-the-scenes sneak peeks at what it\u2019s like to get ready for a big awards show, from getting their nails primped to sneaking in a quick facial to look red carpet ready.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress nominee (she\u2019s also up for Outstanding Drama Series) Elisabeth Moss started her Sunday morning early with celeb-loved skincare specialist Joanna Vargas. The master facialist massaged in a depuffing sheet mask over the actress\u2019s eyes so any dark circles will disappear by the time she hits the red carpet tonight.\n\nWATCH: Fabulous Feathers and Radiant Rainbow Gowns Dominate the 2017 Emmy Awards Red Carpet\n\n\u201cTotally normal Sunday, nothing unusual happening here\u2026 \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc @joannavargasnyc #emmys#handmaidstale,\u201d Moss captioned the photo.\n\nProject Runway host Heidi Klum always loves sharing getting ready Instagram videos with her fans as she preps for shows. So of course, she didn\u2019t hold back for the Emmys. Klum showed off her bare skin at the start of the video, then hyperlapsed through her lengthy glam routine with makeup artist Linda Hay and hair stylist Lorenzo Martin (who used Kenra Professional haircare products to style her locks!).\n\nLooking for more style content?
