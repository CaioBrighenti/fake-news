Jordin Althaus/FOX\n\nLethal Weapon (8 p.m., Fox) \u2014 In the Season 2 finale, the squad is on high alert after an apparent threat is made on Riggs\u2019 life. And based on behind-the-scenes reports, that threat could be for real. Apparently Clayne Crawford (who plays Martin Riggs on the show and who was also excellent on Sundance Channel\u2019s \u201cRectify\u201d) has been pretty awful to deal with on the set. Deadline reports that his behavior has escalated to the point that other actors and crew members don\u2019t want to be on set with him, and it has put the future of the highly rated Fox show in jeopardy. That\u2019s a real shame because this is an excellent show. Get it together, Riggs. (UPDATE: TV Line is reporting now that \"Lethal Weapon\" will likely recast Crawford for Season 3.)\n\nThe Voice (8 p.m., NBC) \u2014 It\u2019s elimination night, which means someone goes home and we\u2019ll be down to the Top 9 by the end of the show.\n\nBull (9 p.m., CBS) \u2014 Bull\u2019s team is rocked when a client is found guilty of murder in the Season 2 finale. This has been renewed for a third season.\n\nChrisley Knows Best (10 p.m., USA) \u2014 Todd insist on being Nanny Faye\u2019s trainer in the Season 6 premiere.", "images": ["https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/lkdeip/picture205284349/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/CBS-17-New_fitted.jpeg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/bohbbe/picture210315509/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/ffLethalWeapon-221_FamilieTies-scn23pt_JA0008_hires1.jpg", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/1r0diw/picture232439562/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/OUT201_0004b.jpg", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/67d7w5/picture232188287/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/weather%20beast.jpg", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/rgmwvr/picture232440034/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Shangri-La_102_0001_R.jpg", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/gfec7q/picture232458697/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/151978_9245.jpg", "https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/logo.svg", "https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=10553&contextPath=7041-10553&pubId=15&cat=&meta=read-blogpost&objId=210313964&type=article&title=What+to+Watch+on+Tuesday%3A+'Lethal+Weapon'+Season+2+finale+--+and+we+may+not+get+a+Season+3&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsobserver.com%2Fentertainment%2Ftv%2Fwarm-tv-blog%2Farticle210313964.html", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/7olyru/picture232500847/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/gypsyOxygen.jpg", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/g315ig/picture230509654/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Zion"], "top_img": "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/bohbbe/picture210315509/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/ffLethalWeapon-221_FamilieTies-scn23pt_JA0008_hires1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/tv/warm-tv-blog/article210313964.html", "title": "'Lethal Weapon' finale: Canceled or renewed after Season 2?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/newsobserver/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "newsobserver", "title": "What to Watch on Tuesday: 'Lethal Weapon' Season 2 finale -- and we may not get a Season 3", "description": "The Season 2 finale of \"Lethal Weapon\" airs on Fox, and because of on-set trouble with one of the stars, Clayne Crawford (who plays Martin Riggs), we may not get a Season 3.
