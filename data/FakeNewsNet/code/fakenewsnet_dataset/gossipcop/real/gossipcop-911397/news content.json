And now, my chance has finally come. And it just so happens that this chance comes when I have two small Petri dish kids who literally cough INTO MY MOUTH and rub their snot on my cheek. You can\u2019t write this stuff I swear! And here we are.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Friday, the singer also posted on Twitter a throwback photo of her and the 2018 Super Bowl Pepsi Halftime Show performer, Justin Timberlake, posed backstage at the 2002 MTV VMAs. He released his new album, Man of the Woods, that day.\n\n\u201c@jtimberlake oooh look who has a new record out!!!\u201d Pink wrote. \u201cMy super bowl partner!!!\u201d", "images": ["http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_twitter_online_social_media_734367.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/millie-bobby-brown-converse-millie-by-you-collection-1.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_instagram_online_social_media_photo_734395.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Amare-Stoudemire-Dallas-Mavericks.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/source-logo_red_120x26px.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beyonce-spirit-the-lion-king-the-gift-album.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Nicki-Minaj-is-Looking-for-Artists-to-Sign-to-her-Record-Label.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rihanna-fenty-release-6-19-part-II.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_online_social_media_facebook_734386.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Megan-Rapinoe-Celebrates-World-Cup-Soccer-Win-With-Nipsey-Hussle-Quote.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-08-at-3.03.22-PM.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Ryan-Destiny-Plans-to-Release-Solo-Project-Later-This-Year.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jermaine-Dupri-on-Current-State-of-Female-Rap-Its-Like-Strippers-Rapping.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cardi-B-on-Jermaine-Dupris-Strippers-Rapping-Comment-It-Seems-Like-Thats-What-People-Wanna-Hear.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-1.01.08-PM.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pink-performance-gty-mem-180108_12x5_992.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toni-Braxton-Testifies-Against-Man-Who-Stole-her-1M-Engagement-Ring.jpg"], "top_img": "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/pink-performance-gty-mem-180108_12x5_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Source Magazine Staff Writer The Five Percenter Newspaper Parliament Editor"], "canonical_link": "http://thesource.com/2018/02/04/pink-battling-flu-super-bowl-2018-performance/", "title": "Pink Battling the Flu Before Super Bowl 2018 Performance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pink Battling the Flu Before Super Bowl 2018 Performance | The Source", "description": "Pink revealed on Saturday via Instagram that she has the flu, but is determined to sing the National Anthem at the 2018 Super Bowl on Sunday as planned.
