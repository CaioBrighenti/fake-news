We gave it all away. Don\u2019t tell the label,\u201d a message at the start of the video says.\n\nBefore its release, Drake, 31, called the video \u201cthe most important thing I have ever done in my career\u201d.\n\nHours later, the Grammy-winning singer issued a challenge on his Instagram saying, \u201clet\u2019s all watch the world be nice to each other even if it\u2019s for 24 hours\u201d.\n\nDrake then posted a video on his Instagram story showing off a card his neighbour gave him, with a bag of chocolates, saying the random gift made his day.", "images":
