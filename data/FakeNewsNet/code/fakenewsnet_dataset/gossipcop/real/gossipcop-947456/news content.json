{"url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/4214731/whitney-houston-sexual-abuse/", "text": "Whitney, a new documentary about Whitney Houston that debuted at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, revealed new details about the late iconic singer.\n\nThe documentary, directed by Kevin Macdonald, suggests that Houston was allegedly sexually abused as a child by Dee Dee Warwick, Houston\u2019s cousin and the sister of soul singer Dionne Warwick.\n\nThe news comes near the end of the film, when Houston\u2019s former longtime assistant, Mary Jones, alleges that Houston told her that she was molested as a young child by her cousin Dee Dee, the niece of Houston\u2019s mother Cissy Houston.\n\nREAD MORE: Lorde apologizes for posting \u2018poorly chosen\u2019 Whitney Houston quote on Instagram\n\nJones mentions that Houston\u2019s alleged molestation had a lasting effect on her life and contributed to her late-life drug problems.\n\n\u201cIt made her question her sexual preference,\u201d she says in Whitney. Jones also says that Houston never told her mother because \u201cI think she was ashamed.\u201d\n\nJones continues: \u201cIf Cissy had known, she would have done something about it, because Cissy loves her children.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Lars von Trier serial killer movie causes mass walkout at Cannes\n\nHouston\u2019s half-brother Gary Garland-Houston also says he was molested between the ages of seven and nine by a female family member, and says his sister was abused too.\n\nDee Dee Warwick, who was 18 years older than Houston, died in 2008. She was twice nominated for a Grammy Award and sang backup for Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and others.\n\nThe allegations made in the documentary Whitney, which was made with the cooperation of Houston\u2019s family, immediately cast a new light on Houston\u2019s troubled life.\n\nThe singer died at the age of 48 in 2012 from what was ruled an accidental drowning in a bathtub. A coroner\u2019s report into her death cited heart disease and drug use as contributing factors. Houston never spoke publicly about her own alleged abuse.\n\nREAD MORE: Whitney Houston death: Bobby Brown says she didn\u2019t die from drugs\n\n\u201cWe always wanted our film to be a corrective to that tabloid story,\u201d said producer Simon Chinn. \u201cThese are specific revelations that I think will get people to a deeper understanding of who Whitney was and in many ways redeem her as a person.\u201d\n\nWhitney, which is to be released in theatres July 7, suggests that the alleged incidents of abuse took place while Cissy Houston was touring. Houston, who had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, with Bobby Brown, is said to have insisted on taking Bobbi on tour with her.\n\nBobbi Kristina died in 2015. She was found unresponsive in a bathtub and died after being in a coma for six months.\n\nRepresentatives for Dionne Warwick have not commented on the allegations.\n\n\u2014With files from the Associated Press", "images": ["https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/chy102175254_high.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/img_8137-1.jpg?quality=60&strip=all&w=55&h=55&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/108/1023/Final_trailer_whitney_848x480_1235992131629.jpg?w=670&quality=70&strip=all", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/social-impulse/large/facebook/national.gif", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/464/306/Paul_live_848x480_723113028000.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rcmp-pelican-narrows-youth-arrest.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=150", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/images/gnlive-ads/default.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hoggardcourt2.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/whiyney.png?w=720&h=379&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/588/527/ChinaWeirdVideoReutersSite_848x480_1532845123958.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005670&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/108/3/GNAT_INES_848x480_1123246659561.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/9572838.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_5882-e1562605151708.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/ad-choices.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/kroeker.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/19617757-e1535073439213.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stock-floor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/517/70/2019-07-13T00-01-27.466Z--1280x720.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/raw_3gr0_botanical_sexism_1.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/logos/news_2x.png", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/36/615/2019-07-12T05-05-04.1Z--1280x720.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/whiyney.png?w=720&h=379&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Scott", "National Online Journalist"], "canonical_link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/4214731/whitney-houston-sexual-abuse/", "title": "Whitney Houston was allegedly sexually abused by her cousin", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#133F6F", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Whitney Houston was allegedly sexually abused by her cousin -
