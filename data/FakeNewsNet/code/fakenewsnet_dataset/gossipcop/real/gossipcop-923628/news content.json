The first two episodes of \u201cRoseanne,\u201d airing back-to-back last week, stunned industry analysts when they averaged a 5.2 and 18.4 million viewers between them. That means this week\u2019s episode was down 25% in the demo and 17% in total viewers. However, only one episode aired this week and it was always likely that it would see some kind of decline.\n\nThe \u201cRoseanne\u201d bump translated into a good night for \u201cThe Middle,\u201d which was up significantly airing immediately after the revival with a 2.2 and 8.3 million viewers. That is a new season high in both measures for the comedy series. \u201cBlack-ish\u201d (1.5, 5.4 million) and \u201cSplitting Up Together\u201d (1.4, 4.8 million) both came down from the increases they saw thanks to \u201cRoseanne\u201d last week, but were still the top shows in their half hour time slots in the key demo. \u201cFor the People\u201d drew a 0.8 and 2.8 million viewers at 10.\n\nFor NBC, \u201cThe Voice\u201d (1.8, 9.3 million) was even while \u201cRise\u201d (0.9, 4.5 million) ticked up in the demo, as was \u201cChicago Med\u201d (1.1, 6.2 million).\n\nOn CBS, \u201cNCIS\u201d (1.3, 12.1 million), \u201cBull\u201d (1.2, 11 million), and \u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d (0.9, 8.5 million) were even.\n\nOn Fox, \u201cLA to Vegas\u201d (0.7, 2 million) ticked up in the demo while the season finale of \u201cThe Mick\u201d (0.7, 1.9 million) was even.\n\nOn The CW, a new episode of \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d (0.5, 1.5 million) was even.\n\nABC won the night in the demo with a 1.8 but finished third in total viewers with 6.6 million. CBS and NBC tied for second in the demo with a 1.2 but CBS was first in viewers with 10.5 million. NBC was second in viewers with 6.7 million. Fox was fourth with a 0.6 and 1.9 million. The CW averaged a 0.4 and 1.2 million viewers.\n\nRELATED CONTENT", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
