I\u2019d be more than happy to fill in for yah. I will wear one of your outfits, the whole thing. I\u2019ll get in there, I\u2019ll scrub real good \u2014 I know how to wash my hands really, really well.\u201d\n\nThe one thing Kimmel won\u2019t do, though, is cut the umbilical cord. One, \u201cit\u2019s patronizing\u201d to act like you\u2019re \u201cthe mayor and you\u2019re cutting the ribbon.\u201d The second reason, \u201cI don\u2019t want to screw up my kid\u2019s bellybutton.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s celebrity dream family is growing fast, not just with Kimmel. The other day on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the Rock star joked about bringing Frances McDormand into his relationship with Hashian. The Oscar winner had taken the time on the Golden Globes stage to acknowledge Johnson\u2019s 16-year-old daughter, Simone Garcia Johnson, who had been serving as Golden Globes ambassador.\n\n\u201cFrances, we\u2019re gonna have to exchange numbers because \u2014 just between you and I, I know no one else is watching \u2014 we\u2019re gonna get married,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is now ready to head to Shanghai and London on the press tour for Rampage, but he said the doctor gave him the okay; his newborn will likely stay put until her due date on April 25. Either way, Kimmel better be on call.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/kimmel-3.jpg?crop=357px%2C105px%2C2473px%2C1298px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dwayne-johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C119px%2C3200px%2C1681px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a147acd56f71c458ad74777cefaea83?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stefani-kimmel-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/euphoria-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kimmel.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C100px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rachel-bloom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1153px%2C605.325px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dwayne-johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C119px%2C3200px%2C1681px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson wants Jimmy Kimmel to deliver his baby: 'I'm gonna need a doula'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Dwayne Johnson,Jimmy Kimmel,Last Night on Late Night", "news_keywords": "Dwayne Johnson,Jimmy Kimmel,Last Night on Late Night", "description": "How do you say no to The Rock?", "og": {"title": "Dwayne Johnson wants Jimmy Kimmel to deliver his baby: 'I'm gonna need a doula'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/", "description": "How do you say no to The Rock?", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dwayne-johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C119px%2C3200px%2C1681px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/", "description": "How do you say no to The Rock?", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dwayne-johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C119px%2C3200px%2C1681px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson wants Jimmy Kimmel to deliver his baby: 'I'm gonna need a doula'", "description": "How do you say no to The Rock?", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/dwayne-johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C119px%2C3200px%2C1681px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_a382GtsKUc"], "publish_date": 1522814400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
