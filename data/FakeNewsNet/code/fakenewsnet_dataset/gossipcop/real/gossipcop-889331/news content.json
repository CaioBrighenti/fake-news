{"url": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B077H1ZBP3", "text": "This movie takes some of the concepts of the original movie and sets it around the stress of Christmas. Specifically the pressure to do the holidays perfectly, combined with their own mothers entering the picture and making everything worse. Thankfully, the movie did not fall into the trap that Hangover II did, and just make a carbon copy of the first movie. That said, there are not as many funny moments in this one as there were in the first. The big scene stealers in this movie were Cheryl Hines who played the mother of Kristen Bell's character, and Christine Baransky who played the mother of Mila Kunis' character. Justin Heartly also had a great role as a male stripper and there was a pretty hilarious cameo by Kenny G. It is pretty standard comedic fare, and as long as you are not expecting it to be more than it is, I do not think the movie will disappoint you.\n\n\n\nFor those who get the blu ray, the movie looks and sounds good. The extras are not extensive, a gag reel, some deleted scenes and a music video featuring the crew members that is a spoof of the end credit sequence of the cast. Okay for what is there, but not a ton of material. Overall, I would say if you enjoyed the first movie you will probably like this one as well, even if not as much. It definitely earns its R rating and is not a family-friendly comedy, but if you enjoy that brand of comedy, it is entertaining.", "images":
