Are we really friends? Are we work mates? Children are not mature enough to recognize that subtle difference.\u201d\n\nBut another disturbing aspect, Curtis wrote, revolved around the fact that the alleged assault was carried out by a stunt coordinator \u2014 the person on set who\u2019s responsible for the actors\u2019 safety. \u201cI was suspended under a helicopter by a wire, holding onto the hand of the man who is now being accused of abuse,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cAll of us must take some responsibility that the loose and relaxed camaraderie that we share with our young performers has carried with it a misguided assumption that they are adults in an adult world, capable of making adult choices,\u201d she went on.\n\nCurtis is only the latest involved with the production of \u201cTrue Lies\u201d to speak out on Dushku\u2019s allegation, which Kramer has denied. Director James Cameron, at a Television Critics Association panel on Saturday, commended Dushku\u2019s \u201cbrave\u201d decision to go public with the \u201cheartbreaking\u201d story.\n\n\u201cHad I known about it, there would have been no mercy,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cI have three daughters. There\u2019d really be no mercy now.\u201d\n\nKramer has since been dropped by his agency, World Production Agency.\n\n\u201cSuch behavior is unacceptable and entirely at odds with the the standards of conduct we demand of ourselves,\u201d WPA president Richard Caleel said in a statement.\n\nRead Curtis\u2019 full op-ed here.", "images":
