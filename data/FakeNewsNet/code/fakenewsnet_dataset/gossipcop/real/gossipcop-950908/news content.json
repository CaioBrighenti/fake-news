and Benedict Cumberbatch have been crowned PETA\u2019s Most Beautiful Vegan Celebrities of 2018.\n\nAva and Avengers: Infinity War star Benedict beat out the likes of actors Zac Efron and Ellen Pompeo, and musicians including Ne-Yo, will.i.am, Swizz Beatz, and Jason Derulo to land this year\u2019s titles, following a vote by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) officials.\n\n\u201cAva DuVernay and Benedict Cumberbatch are saving animals not only by going vegan but also by sharing their commitment with the world,\u201d PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange shares in a statement. \u201cThe vegan powerhouses behind Selma and Doctor Strange, respectfully, beautifully show what it means to be a compassionate star in 2018.\u201d\n\nDuVernay has long championed the benefits of veganism, insisting it\u2019s a social justice issue.\n\n\u201cMy mum always said to treat others like you like to be treated\u2026,\u201d she previously told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201c(Everyone) wants to be\u2026 respected and treated in a loving way.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, British actor Cumberbatch is a new vegan after choosing to stop eating all meat, dairy, and other animal products to help him shape up for his role as comic book superhero Doctor Strange.\n\n\u201cI eat a plant-based diet,\u201d he told Time Out London.\n\nAnimal rights organisation bosses, who this year changed the name of their annual honours from Sexiest Vegan Celebrities to Most Beautiful Vegan Celebrities, have previously celebrated stars like Liam Hemsworth, Miley Cyrus, Ellen Page, Jared Leto, Kristen Bell, Jessica Chastain, Carrie Underwood, Natalie Portman, Tobey Maguire, and Alicia Silverstone for their vegan lifestyles, while Jenna Dewan, Maggie Q, and Ruby Rose shared 2017\u2019s title.", "images": ["https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/app/uploads/2019/04/whatsapp-banner.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2120107461598065&ev=PageView&noscript=1",
