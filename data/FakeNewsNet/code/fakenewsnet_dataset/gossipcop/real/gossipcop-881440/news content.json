For the past decade since Keeping Up with the Kardashians premiered, the star\u2019s been an open book on her hit E! show; on Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter; and she\u2019s shown us multiple variations of her naked body on the cover of Paper magazine, Mert Alas & Marcus Piggott\u2019s new photography book and more. But yes, the soon-to-be mom of three is still coming up with ways to surprise you.\n\nLooking for more style content?

The biggest bombshell? Kardashian admitted that back in high school, she\u2019d use her school uniform skirt to score good grades.\n\nImage zoom\n\n\u201cWe would wear uniforms, so I would wear this little skirt,\u201d the star said. \u201cI used to cheat on all of my tests. I would flip up the skirt and write all of the answers in washable ink. And what\u2019s the teacher gonna do? Ask you to lift up your skirt? Like, sexual harassment!\u201d\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: UPDATED! Kim Kardashian\u2019s Style Evolution, As Told Through Her NYFW Appearances\n\nKardashian\u2019s not wearing plaid schoolgirl skirts anymore (instead she prefers to stick with bike shorts, see-through leggings and fanny packs). And she credits her self-proclaimed improving sense of style courtesy to her husband Kanye West, who\u2019s given the star a complete closet makeover.\n\nWhen asked who has a better sense of style, Kardashian hands it to her husband: \u201cI mean, natural fashion sense? Probably him,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I\u2019ve learned to grow into it and learned to really love fashion. I\u2019d say it\u2019s like a tie now.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for AFI; Dominique Charriau/WireImage\n\nThe style influencer herself says she looks towards Cher, who she channeled on her recent Harper\u2019s Bazaar Arabia cover, for style inspiration. \u201cMy dream of life would be to look in her closet one day and just, I would die. I would die,\u201d Kardashian said.\n\nOne thing you might not be surprised to learn? The star\u2019s favorite body part: \u201cMy upper stomach, if that is even a thing,\u201d she said.\n\nImage zoom Kim Kardashian/Instagram\n\nWhat\u2019s one question you\u2019re dying to ask Kim Kardashian?
