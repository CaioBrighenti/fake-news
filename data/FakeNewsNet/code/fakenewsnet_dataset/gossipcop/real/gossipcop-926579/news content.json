As a top model and an A-list actress, they are frequently the subject of spotlight and scrutiny, and that isn't always easy to handle.\n\nLively sat down with Hadid for a candid conversation about body image and shaming for the May issue of Harper's Bazaar, and they kept things honest.\n\n\u201cMost of it is just nonsense. But it can still hurt,\u201d Hadid said of body shamers. \"Nowadays, people are quick to say, \u2018I used to love Gigi\u2019s body, and now she just gave in.'\u201d\n\n\"If I could choose, I would have my ass back and I would have the tits I had a few years ago,\" she admitted. \"But, honestly, we can't look back with regret. I loved my body then, and I love my body now.\"\n\nImage zoom Catwalking\n\nLively had similar things to say, explaining that the way people view celebrities doesn't normally take behind-the-scenes work\u2014like intense training and even Photoshop\u2014into account.\n\nRELATED: The Most Loving Things Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Said Before They Ended Their 2-Year Relationship\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important for young people not to compare themselves with what they see online. It\u2019s our job as actors and/or models to be in shape. We have access to gyms and trainers and healthy food. And then on top of that, 99.9 percent of the time the images are Photoshopped. I\u2019m guilty myself of being at a photo shoot and saying, 'That looks terrible on me.' And they\u2019re like, 'We\u2019ll fix it.' And you\u2019re so relieved.\u201d\n\nBut while she admits to being relieved by Photoshop, she wants retouched images to come with a warning. \"My dream is for all images to have a little asterisk next to them with a caption that reads, this photo has been retouched. Just so there\u2019s a gentle reminder that, hey, this isn\u2019t real life. Think of editorials or ads as a painting, an art form. I mean, that\u2019s definitely not how we wake up looking every single day of our lives,\" Lively added.", "images": ["https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1159763493.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1161310610.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/02/gettyimages-1083155312_0.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/05/gettyimages-1142167980_0.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1125499074.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1159072014.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1148451050.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/09/gettyimages-628404988.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1020266574.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/gettyimages-1148286836.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/gettyimages-1145748483_0.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-617560286.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1154107726.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/1560356906/061219-kim-kardashian-lead.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2018/04/gettyimages-924255038.jpg?itok=H66WKa4d", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/khloe-kardashian-lead.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/061219-britney-spears-lead.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/gettyimages-1152081149.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/df-10961_10965_r-large_1000x667p_thumbnail.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1161254871.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/04/gettyimages-924255038.jpg?itok=A-wNCpgl", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/070119-jordyn-woods-khloe-kardashian-lead.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/04/gettyimages-924255038.jpg?itok=A-wNCpgl", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandra Whittaker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/gigi-hadid-blake-lively-body-shaming", "title": "Gigi Hadid Knows People Think She\u2019s Too Thin", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "News,latest,Celebrity,Models,Social Media,Gigi Hadid,Blake Lively", "news_keywords": "News,latest,Celebrity,Models,Social Media,Gigi Hadid,Blake Lively", "description": "Blake Lively interviewed Gigi Hadid for Harper's Bazaar about body shaming and retouched images.
