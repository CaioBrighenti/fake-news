When some women think of foundation think of a heavy cover up that masks their skin, but that simply isn\u2019t true. Foundation has advanced just like everything else. It now has ingredients that help with anti-aging and acne reduction, in addition to coming in light-weight, air-whipped formulas \u2013 it\u2019s much more than a cover up for imperfections! But then of course there is a surge of tinted moisturizers that claim to hydrate the skin while simultaneously evening out your skin tone\u2026 Okay, now it really got confusing! First, let\u2019s figure out how they\u2019re similar.\n\nBoth foundation and tinted moisturizers contain a solvent (water), mixtures of humectants (chemicals that bind water to your skin) and emollients (oily chemicals that smooth the skin and create a moisture barrier). We all know from elementary school that oil and water don\u2019t mix so they both contain surfactants to keep the water and oil-soluble ingredients mixed together in a creamy base. Like most products on the shelf, they both have preservatives to keep them from spoiling \u2013 who wants to put moldy foundation or tinted moisturizer on \u2013 yuck!! And of course, since they\u2019re designed to provide some color to your skin, they contain pigments. So how do they differ you ask?\n\nWell, they\u2019re definitely similar, but not identical. When looking for more coverage, I recommend going for foundation because it typically provides more pigment, with little to no imperfections in sight. As previously mentioned, both have humectants, but tinted moisturizers tend to have more so they\u2019ll hydrate your skin better than a foundation typically would. They also give more of a sheer coverage so your natural skin, imperfections and all will still show through. Because changes are pretty minimal, it boils down to personal preference and which would be better for your skin type.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for minimal coverage a tinted moisturizer would be best. Additionally, if you have dry skin this would be a great option for you due to it containing more humectants. Foundations normally work best for women with oily skin and looking for more complete coverage. There is no one-size-fits-all for foundation or tinted moisturizer so it\u2019s really trial and error.\n\nAt the end of the day, they both deliver skin-tinting pigments and do essentially the same thing. It\u2019s going to be more of a personal preference and likely depend on how much coverage you\u2019re looking to achieve at any given time. I would recommend having them both in your beauty arsenal because as the seasons change, it\u2019s always great to have options!", "images": ["https://trueskincarecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/foundation-vs-tinted-moisturizer.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20870%20450'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://www.crystalcleardm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/images/ccdmlogo.png", "https://trueskincarecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/logo-footer.png"], "top_img": "https://trueskincarecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/foundation-vs-tinted-moisturizer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://trueskincarecenter.com/blog/the-battle-begins-foundation-vs-tinted-moisturizer/", "title": "The Battle Begins: Foundation vs. Tinted Moisturizer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Battle Begins: Foundation vs. Tinted Moisturizer - True Skin Care Center", "description": "I know ladies, it\u2019s confusing \u2013 which do you choose, foundation or tinted moisturizer?!
