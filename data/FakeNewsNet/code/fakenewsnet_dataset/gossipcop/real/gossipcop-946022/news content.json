{"url": "https://www.self.com/story/demi-lovato-new-song-sober-relapse", "text": "In March, Demi Lovato celebrated six years of sobriety, an experience that she\u2019s been incredibly open about with the general public. \u201cSo grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness,\u201d she wrote at the time. \u201cIt is possible.\u201d\n\nNow, in a new song, Lovato sings about breaking sobriety. Although the singer has not confirmed whether she's singing about herself, many have speculated that the song is about a personal relapse.\n\nIn a new song released Thursday called \u201cSober,\u201d Lovato poignantly sings about reaching a breaking point.\n\n\u201cI got no excuses for all of these goodbyes/ Call me when it\u2019s over \u2018cus I\u2019m dying inside,\u201d Lovato sings. \u201cWake me when the shakes are gone and the cold sweats disappear/ Call me when it\u2019s over and myself has reappeared/ I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know why/ I do it every, every, every time/ It\u2019s only when I\u2019m lonely/ Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don\u2019t wanna fight.\u201d\n\nShe also addresses fans in the song: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the fans I lost/ Who watched me fall again/ I wanna be a role model/ But I\u2019m only human.\u201d\n\nIn the lyrics at the end of the song, Lovato promises to get help and apologizes.\n\nLovato also tweeted out the video this week with the comment: \"My truth...\"\n\nLovato has been an outspoken advocate and ally when it comes to experiences with sobriety and mental health challenges.\n\nBack in September 2017 at the annual Brent Shapiro Foundation for Drug Prevention Summer Spectacular, Lovato said that \"every day is a battle.\" To stay on top of it, she said she was going to therapy regularly, keeping up with her medications, going to AA meetings, and staying physically active.\n\nLovato also shared her experiences with fans in her 2017 documentary , Simply Complicated . In the film, she explained how she believed being candid about these issues would help de-stigmatize them, especially for young women who may not be inclined to seek help if they need it. \u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of young pop stars\u2026talking about their issues, and I wanted [to be] someone that my little sister could look up to,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to be the role model that I needed growing up.\u201d\n\nAs SELF wrote previously , it's important to remember that a relapse isn't a personal failure or a sign that treatment has failed. For many people, a relapse is just another part of their recovery path. But a relapse is definitely a sign that it's time to check in with a counselor or other addiction treatment specialist to help identify your potential triggers and avoid future relapses as much as possible.\n\nRelated:", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5bec5c5158f35c2d48916708/4:3/h_130/woman-on-couch-with-wine.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b2d29a5ed82452713843645/2:1/pass/demi-lovato-sober-song.jpg", "https://collector-PX69t0oUvr.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX69t0oUvr", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b0f1362fb856d7d3d023877/4:3/h_130/meditation-health-benefits.jpg", "https://www.self.com/images/self-starter-failsafe.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a6255a8654f4911d20879d1/4:3/h_130/GettyImages-sb10066465l-001.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b2bc8a59ffbab247bcc1ee3/4:3/w_728,c_limit/GettyImages-960656228.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b2d29a5ed82452713843645/2:1/pass/demi-lovato-sober-song.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Elizabeth", "June"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/demi-lovato-relapse-new-song-sober", "title": "Demi Lovato Sings About Breaking Sobriety in Her Emotional New Song \u2018Sober\u2019", "meta_data": {"generator": "autopilot-build-Sat Jul 13 2019 12:46:29 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "Devon Elizabeth", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond&#233; Nast 2019", "description": "In her new song \u201cSober,\u201d Demi Lovato sings about relapsing.
