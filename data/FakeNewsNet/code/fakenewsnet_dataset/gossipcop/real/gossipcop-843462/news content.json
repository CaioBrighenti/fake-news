Orlando Bloom began his career in London's West End and then became an international star with his performance as Legolas in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. He has subsequently appeared in many films including the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise, \"Elizabethtown\", and \"New York, I Love You\", and many more. He was born Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Bloom on January 13 1977, in Canterbury, Kent, England. After the overwhelming success of the sequels, \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" (2002) and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\" (2003), Bloom became one of the brightest young stars in Hollywood. Having proved already that he is good with franchises, Orlando jumped ship to star with Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl\" (2003). This move helped him further capture the hearts of young moviegoers worldwide. Of Bloom's other efforts, one of the most notable was the historical epic \"Kingdom of Heaven\" (2005). He also starred in \"Elizabethtown\" (2005). He regained his marquee status with his return to the ever-dependable Disney franchise installments \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\" (2006) and \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\" (2007). His appearance in \"The Three Musketeers\" (2011) was received with little enthusiasm. But then, his role in \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" (2012) placed him once again in front of a large, welcoming audience. Still early in his career, Bloom continues to seek challenging new roles that will dazzle his fans. Away movies, he has one child with Australian model Miranda Kerr to whom he was married from 2010 to 2013. In February 2019 Orlando proposed to singer Katy Perry, reportedly giving her an engagement ring that cost $5 million.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-504136806-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/epstein.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/GettyImages-488355885-e1557100267439.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/couple-f56dee44.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-167802829.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/gina.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Robert-Downey-Jr.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/couple-3b0369fa.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GettyImages-870070118-e1550374395257.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Miranda-Kerr.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1093667182.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-502228488.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Leonardo-DiCaprio.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tc.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-300x300/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GettyImages-870070118-e1550374395257.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1160570133.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Pamela-Anderson.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Tom-Hanks1-e1558999027688.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Jon-Favreau.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cc.jpg"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GettyImages-870070118-e1550374395257.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/orlando-bloom-net-worth/", "title": "Orlando Bloom Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Orlando Bloom Net Worth and salary: Orlando Bloom is an English actor who has a net worth of", "cnw_share_fb_count": 144, "cnw_share_tw_count": 65, "fb": {"app_id": 241750049176605, "admins": 194602255, "pages": 135556409817901}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Orlando Bloom Net Worth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/orlando-bloom-net-worth/", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GettyImages-870070118-e1550374395257.jpg", "site_name": "Celebrity Net Worth", "description": "Orlando Bloom Net Worth and salary: Orlando Bloom is an English actor who has a net worth of"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CelebrityNetWorth", "modified_time": "2019-02-17T03:37:50+00:00", "published_time": "2010-01-17T18:04:30+00:00", "section": "Actors", "tag": "richest actors"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@celebnetworth", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GettyImages-870070118-e1550374395257.jpg", "title": "Orlando Bloom Net Worth", "description": "Orlando Bloom Net Worth and salary: Orlando Bloom is an English actor who has a net worth of"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1263751470.0, "source": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com", "summary": ""}
