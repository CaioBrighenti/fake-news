{"url": "https://www.byrdie.com/zendaya-beauty-routine", "text": "If we're surprised that Zendaya turns 20 years young today, it's only because the actress and singer perpetually schools us on beauty and culture, quietly boasting a wisdom that definitely exceeds her age. Whether she's walking the red carpet, appearing in a Beyonc\u00e9 video, or even addressing criticism or haters, it's never without the utmost eloquence nor lack of insight\u2014the girl just gets it. And from a beauty standpoint alone, she constantly surprises us. What can we say? Just in the past year or two, Zendaya has quickly become one of our all-time favorite muses.\n\nIn honor of her birthday, we thought it only fitting to count down some of the best beauty tips we've learned from this perennially rising star\u2026 so far, of course. Keep reading to see her must-know advice, from the anti-contouring trend she helped foster to her beauty philosophy. (Spoiler: There are no rules.)\n\nIt's probably pretty easy to garner this from her countless bold red carpet appearances, but Coleman came right out and said it when we chatted with her last fall. \"If you\u2019re asking for the answers, they don\u2019t exist,\" she said. \"Beauty has no definition, and if you do create a definition for yourself as you grow older, it\u2019s ever-changing. It\u2019ll be very different from when you\u2019re my age and you\u2019re 18 years old to when you\u2019re 22 and when you\u2019re 30. Take your time.\" PREACH.\n\nWe got it, straight from her hairstylist. Basically, it involves two different-sized curling irons and a lot less effort than you'd think.\n\nPretty please. Non-touring, the anti-contour that embraces a fresh, dewy finish without heavy face sculpting, will continue to be huge into the fall season.\n\nThe actress famously does her own, even for the biggest red carpets. But she says that ditching fancy glam squads has only benefited her look. \"Honestly, I just kind of learned, and it was a process,\" she told us last year. \"There were a lot of times people would do my makeup and it would be awful, and I would be orange. Nothing matched. So then you learn how to do your own makeup. I watched a lot of YouTube videos when I was little and taught myself.\"\n\nIn at least one way, Zendaya is all of us\u2014even she has to put on her entire face in a flash just to get out the door sometimes. Better yet, her quickie regimen involves drugstore makeup that amounts to less than $20\u2014see how she does it here.\n\n\"Shimmer,\" she says. \"I love shimmery stuff. That\u2019s my secret. Once I do all this makeup and I put shimmery powder on, it\u2019s like, Oh my gosh\u2014your skin is so fresh and glowy! Nope. It\u2019s actually just shimmer powder.\" PSA: She's a fan of Urban Decay's Naked Illuminated Shimmering Powder for Face and Body ($32).\n\n\"In general, it comes to whatever I\u2019m wearing that day, whatever seems to pop into my head,\" she says of her famously unpredictable turns on the red carpet. \"A lot of times, it\u2019s past inspirations. Bianca Jagger was one inspiration; Cher was a huge inspiration for my VMAs look a few years ago. Everything just repeats itself.\"", "images": ["https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/UquWc1VsMypAC_a3d1cnwYPY42Q=/699x830/filters:fill(auto,1)/Screenshot1906-6fc696a44dba4097a4a42961f77f244f.png", "https://:0"], "top_img": "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/UquWc1VsMypAC_a3d1cnwYPY42Q=/699x830/filters:fill(auto,1)/Screenshot1906-6fc696a44dba4097a4a42961f77f244f.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Victoria Hoff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.byrdie.com/zendaya-beauty-routine", "title": "The 7 Best Beauty Tips We've Ever Learned From Zendaya", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "In honor of the actress's 20th birthday, we're counting down Zendaya's best hair and makeup tips.", "sailthru.tags": "byrdie,makeup,makeup-face", "article": {"section": "Byrdie"}, "fb": {"app_id": 166036133580911}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Byrdie", "url": "https://www.byrdie.com/zendaya-beauty-routine", "title": "The 7 Best Beauty Tips We've Ever Learned From Zendaya", "description": "In honor of the actress's 20th birthday, we're counting down Zendaya's best hair and makeup tips.", "image": "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/UquWc1VsMypAC_a3d1cnwYPY42Q=/699x830/filters:fill(auto,1)/Screenshot1906-6fc696a44dba4097a4a42961f77f244f.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@ByrdieBeauty", "title": "The 7 Best Beauty Tips We've Ever Learned From Zendaya", "description": "In honor of the actress's 20th birthday, we're counting down Zendaya's best hair and makeup tips.", "image": "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/UquWc1VsMypAC_a3d1cnwYPY42Q=/699x830/filters:fill(auto,1)/Screenshot1906-6fc696a44dba4097a4a42961f77f244f.png"}, "lotame": {"tax2": "byr_makeup-face", "tax1": "byr_makeup", "tax0": "byr"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.byrdie.com", "summary": ""}
