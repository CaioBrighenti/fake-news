Meghan Markle isn't quite sure, but she's about to find out. While visiting with the excited crowds outside Edinburgh Castle on Tuesday, during her royal visit to Scotland with fianc\u00e9 Prince Harry , the royal-to-be reportedly answered a question about her upcoming hen party , revealing that although she doesn't know exactly what will go down at the celebration, she does know the details are already taken care of.\n\nLondon resident Tom Martin was the royal well-wisher turned intrepid reporter who had the genius idea to ask the Suits actress about her pre-wedding festivities. \"We asked them what they were doing for their stag and hen dos,\" Martin told PEOPLE later that day. \"Meghan said, 'I'm not sure\u2014it's sorted, but it will be fun.'\" Harry is also reportedly unsure of all the details of his bachelor party , which, we can only assume, will be hosted by big brother Prince William . \"I'm sure William's got something up his sleeve,\" Martin said.\n\nAs the duo continued to make their way through the crowd, shaking hands and accepting small stuffed animals and quite a few heart-shaped Valentine's Day cards, Markle also made a point of complimenting one woman's style. In a video shared on Twitter by the Scottish woman, Markle stops her fast-paced meet-and-greet to point at her hot pink fingernails and get a closer look at them. \"Wow, look at your nails, that's pretty fantastic!\" Markle says with a smile while shaking the woman's hand, agreeing that they are, indeed, \"very Valentine's-y! \"\n\n\"Meghan Markle likes my nails! Dream come true \ud83d\udc97 \" the lucky spectator captioned the clip.\n\nSee more: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Just Revealed New Royal Wedding Details\n\nSadly, Markle will have to live vicariously through this Twitter user and other royal family fans when it comes to brightly colored manicures. British magazine OK! reported last year that Queen Elizabeth II has deemed garish nail colors and fake nails to be \"vulgar,\" and so far, Markle has joined Kate Middleton and QEII in sticking to nude colors , like the queen's favorite for the past few decades, Essie Ballet Slippers.", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5bd1ca5acbda612d1b8b853e/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1053245482.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a8324aa25a8c907d4c828a3/1:1/w_767/meghan-markle-bachelorette-party-plans.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5d08ca81b6f210bcb036dfc3/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-960071402.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a8324aa25a8c907d4c828a3/master/pass/meghan-markle-bachelorette-party-plans.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5bc49605a9dc642d7745b9b3/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1051952284.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a8324aa25a8c907d4c828a3/master/pass/meghan-markle-bachelorette-party-plans.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/meghan-markle-bachelorette-party-sorted", "title": "Meghan Markle Says Her Bachelorette Party Is Already \"Sorted\"", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "During her royal visit to Scotland with Prince Harry, Meghan Markle answered questions about her bachelorette party.", "og": {"description": "The duchess-to-be herself said the plans have been \"sorted.\"", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a8324aa25a8c907d4c828a3/master/pass/meghan-markle-bachelorette-party-plans.jpg", "title": "Meghan Markle's Bachelorette Party Plans Are Apparently Well Underway", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/meghan-markle-bachelorette-party-sorted", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The duchess-to-be herself said the plans have been \"sorted.\"", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a8324aa25a8c907d4c828a3/master/pass/meghan-markle-bachelorette-party-plans.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Meghan Markle's Bachelorette Party Plans Are Apparently Well Underway", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/meghan-markle-bachelorette-party-sorted", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "snd,Meghan Markle,Royal Wedding", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,snd,Meghan Markle,Royal Wedding"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
