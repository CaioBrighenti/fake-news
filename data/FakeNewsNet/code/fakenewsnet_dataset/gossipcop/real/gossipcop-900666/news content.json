Well, if this teaser of Britain\u2019s Prince Harry interviewing former US president Barack Obama is anything to go by, the answer is a lot of fun.\n\nOn Prince Harry\u2019s request, Barack Obama agreed to star in a guest edition of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Kensington Palace shared the trailer on Sunday,where Harry can be seen joking with Obama.\n\nIn the preview, Obama asks Harry if he has to speak quickly, since he is a slow speaker. \u201cDo I need a British accent?\u201d jokes Obama.\n\nIn turn, Harry tells the former president that if he takes long pauses between answers, he will get \u201cthe face\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet me see the face\u201d, asks Obama, leading Prince Harry to pull an exaggerated mock-grimace. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that face,\u201d the former president says.\n\nHere is a sneak preview of when @BarackObama met Prince Harry for the interview. Listen to the full interview on 27th December on @BBCr4today. pic.twitter.com/p5I1dUdyhx \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) December 17, 2017\n\nThe trailer also shows Prince Harry saying that while Obama is excited, he is feeling nervous. \u201cI\u2019ll interview you if you want,\u201d says Obama. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it this way, I\u2019d much prefer that,\u201d replies Harry.\n\nHarry and Obama are known for their rapport and their very public exchanges of sassy banter. Who can forget the British royal\u2019s Twitter \u2018war\u2019 with the Obamas while promoting the 2015 Invictus Games, which lead to Harry\u2019s by-now-famous \u2018mic drop\u2019 moment? Not even the Queen.\n\nInvictus Games is a Paralympic sporting event for injured or sick armed forces personnel, that was found by Prince Harry in 2014.\n\nHarry and Obama hung out at this year\u2019s Invictus Games in Toronto in September, joking, cheering and taking selfies with fans. Social media gushed over the bromance, spinning memes around it.\n\nThe full 40-minute interview will air December 27 on England\u2019s BBC Radio 4 Today.\n\nFirst Published: Dec 18, 2017 12:23 IST", "images": ["https://q.quora.com/_/ad/18d72aacafe84701a5b30e418a8a6611/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/logo-big-cm.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/default_author.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/ht-copy.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/htlogo.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/12/18/Pictures/britain-obama-royals_c99388f6-e3bf-11e7-bd8c-dad1885580ce.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/ht/source_weather-cm.png"], "top_img": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/12/18/Pictures/britain-obama-royals_c99388f6-e3bf-11e7-bd8c-dad1885580ce.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ht Correspondent"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/do-i-need-a-british-accent-asks-barack-obama-as-prince-harry-interviews-him-for-radio-show/story-aWKJqVU9gwEI1VpHOCCPiI.html", "title": "Do I need a British accent?
