Scott is the daughter of country music singer Linda Davis, best known for her duet vocals on Reba McEntire's 1993 hit \"Does He Love You\",[5] and Charles Kelley is the brother of pop and country artist Josh Kelley.[6] Hillary Scott attended Donelson Christian Academy in Donelson, Tennessee. Kelley moved to Nashville in mid-2005 from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he had been working construction with his brother John. Trying to become a successful solo country artist, Kelley convinced his old middle-school classmate, Haywood, to move to Nashville from Georgia in 2006 so they could write music together. Shortly thereafter, Scott recognized Kelley from Myspace, and they started to talk at a Nashville music club. Kelley invited Scott to join him and Haywood in the new group, which assumed the name Lady Antebellum.[7]\n\nOn the BBC Radio 2 Drivetime Show August 9, 2010, the band explained that the name comes from when the group did a photo shoot in historical costumes at antebellum houses. In American history, the Antebellum era was the period before the Civil War in the Southern United States, before slavery was abolished. The trio then began performing at local venues in Nashville before being signed in July 2007 to a recording contract with Capitol Records Nashville. In an interview with Sirius Satellite Radio, Scott said she was rejected from auditions for American Idol twice, not even making it past the first round.[5]\n\nThe name \"Lady Antebellum\" has been criticized for glorifying an era of the American South in which society revolved around the institutionalized slavery of black people.[8]\n\n2007\u20132009: Lady Antebellum [ edit ]\n\nLady Antebellum performs in concert in 2008, showing Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott\n\nShortly after the trio signed to the label, recording artist Jim Brickman chose Lady Antebellum to sing on his 2007 single \"Never Alone,\" which reached No. 14 on the Billboard adult contemporary charts.
