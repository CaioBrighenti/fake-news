It was just about her. He listed her virtues as a wife, a mother, a songwriter, a producer, an entertainer, a humanitarian, a culture shifter, and one of the greatest vocalists we\u2019ve ever known.\n\n(I think that was when she started to get a little choked up.)\n\nBut Urban also took the time to explain why he was the one lucky enough to be presenting her with the CMT Artist of the Year honor. \u201cOur friendship really began way back in 2008, when we joined forces and hit the road together. And each night we would sing \u2019Stop Draggin\u2019 My Heart Around.\u2019 And it was then that I witnessed not only the power of her voice,\u201d Urban said, \u201cbut the emotion she brings to every performance.\n\n\u201cShe simply makes you feel when she sings.\u201d\n\nAnd apparently, Underwood simply makes you feel when she accepts important awards, too.\n\nHer heartfelt acceptance speech wasn\u2019t so much about her as it was about the other honorees, the other women behind the scenes in the music industry, and other girls who might have the same dreams she had when she was a young country music fan and hopeful.\n\n\u201cWe need more things like this. I definitely want to say to all the incredible, amazing, talented women who have been on this stage tonight: You are not here because you are women. You are here because you are dang good. And it is an honor to get to share tonight with you,\u201d Underwood said.\n\n\u201cThank you to women who are in this industry: the managers, the executives, the hair and makeup (people), the wardrobe (people), the songwriters, the musicians, thank you. Whether or not you know it, you are the backbone of this music. And it is up to all of us to keep opening those doors.\n\n\u201cI want to see little girls at home seeing us on stage being like, \u2019I want to do that.\u2019 And I want them to know that that\u2019s possible,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAlison Bonaguro Alison makes her living loving country music. She's based in Chicago, but she's always leaving her heart in Nashville.\n\nThen came the music. An eight-song medley spanning 50 years of some of the most iconic country hits from the women who came before Underwood. Starting with a Tammy Wynette song from 1968, \u201cStand by Your Man.\u201d From there, her 2019 tour mates Maddie & Tae and Runaway June joined her on the next seven songs from consecutive years: Dolly Parton \u2019s \u201c9 to 5,\u201d The Judd \u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 with the Rhythm of the Rain,\u201d Martina McBride \u2019s \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d Faith Hill \u2019s \u201cWild One,\u201d Reba \u2019s \u201cWhy Haven\u2019t I Heard from You,\u201d and Shania Twain \u2019s \u201cMan! I Feel Like a Woman!\u201d The group closed the performance and the show with Underwood\u2019s latest hit single, \u201cCry Pretty.\u201d", "images": ["http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:661417?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=480&height=270", "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:661417?width=1200&height=675&.jpg"], "top_img": "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:661417?width=1200&height=675&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alison Bonaguro"], "canonical_link": "http://www.cmt.com/news/1800047/carrie-underwood-closes-cmt-artists-of-the-year-with-50-years-of-songs/", "title": "Carrie Underwood Closes CMT Artists of the Year with 50 Years of Songs", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtvnservices.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "beacon_topic": "cmt.com"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:articles.cmt.com:1800047"}, "og": {"site_name": "CMT News", "title": "Carrie Underwood Closes CMT Artists of the Year with 50 Years of Songs", "url": "http://www.cmt.com/news/1800047/carrie-underwood-closes-cmt-artists-of-the-year-with-50-years-of-songs/", "image": {"identifier": "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:661417?width=1200&height=675&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "\"You Are Here Because You Are Dang Good,\" She Tells the Crowd"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"You Are Here Because You Are Dang Good,\" She Tells the Crowd", "title": "Carrie Underwood Closes CMT Artists of the Year with 50 Years of Songs", "image": "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:661417?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "url": "http://www.cmt.com/news/1800047/carrie-underwood-closes-cmt-artists-of-the-year-with-50-years-of-songs/", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "\"You Are Here Because You Are Dang Good,\" She Tells the Crowd", "thumbnail": "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:cmt.com/news/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/1052417696-1539832675-300x199.jpg?quality=0.8&format=jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.cmt.com", "summary": ""}
