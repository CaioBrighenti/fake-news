Here\u2019s the best of them (NSFW language):\n\nThere\u2019s a reason all our early shows were CSI, UFC, TNA, MXC, UTI. No one around here knew how to read. \u2014 SPIKE (@spike) January 16, 2018\n\nMy favorite number is 329 because it\u2019s the number of times COPS is on every night. \u2014 SPIKE (@spike) January 16, 2018\n\nI gave my entire staff empty gift cards as parting gifts because fuck them and their joy. \u2014 SPIKE (@spike) January 16, 2018\n\nI was baked when I pitched 1000 Ways to Die. Those episodes are mostly based on my nightmares. \u2014 SPIKE (@spike) January 17, 2018\n\nI hated all my logos, but this last one looks like a tattoo design from a rejected Ink Master contestant. \u2014 SPIKE (@spike) January 16, 2018\n\nI was extremely disappointed when Stripperella had no nudity. I aired that show solely based off the name and the potential for frontal. #GoodbyeSpike #SpikeUnfiltered \u2014 SPIKE (@spike) January 16, 2018\n\nI honestly thought catch a contractor was a show about STDs. \u2014 SPIKE (@spike) January 16, 2018\n\nWe had a show called The Joe Schmo Show. Apparently every decent show name was taken. \u2014 SPIKE (@spike) January 16, 2018\n\nAccording to AdWeek, the idea was to have \u201cthe fictional bro to react \u2018like someone might in the modern workplace if they got handed a pink slip,\u2019 said Red Fabbri, Spike TV\u2019s VP of fan engagement and editorial. \u201cHe\u2019s confronting an existential crisis, having a bit of a meltdown in public.\u201d Spike TV becomes The Paramount Network on Thursday.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/1568-angel_1200x6282.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/netflix-tvs.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/angel2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2way14.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2way14.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8507038badc1c41adb48fd6b51538fbd?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2way14.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/17/spike-tv-twitter-account/", "title": "Spike TV\u2019s Twitter account goes 'rogue,' profanely mocking channel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Spike TV", "news_keywords": "Spike TV", "description": "Spike TV's Twitter account is ripping its own channel's programming Ahead of the cable channel's rebranding into the Paramount Network,\u2026", "og": {"title": "Spike TV\u2019s Twitter account goes 'rogue,' profanely mocking channel's shows", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/17/spike-tv-twitter-account/", "description": "Spike TV's Twitter account is ripping its own channel's programming Ahead of the cable channel's rebranding into the Paramount Network,\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2way14.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/17/spike-tv-twitter-account/", "description": "Spike TV's Twitter account is ripping its own channel's programming Ahead of the cable channel's rebranding into the Paramount Network,\u2026", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2way14.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/17/spike-tv-twitter-account/", "title": "Spike TV\u2019s Twitter account goes 'rogue,' profanely mocking channel's shows", "description": "Spike TV's Twitter account is ripping its own channel's programming Ahead of the cable channel's rebranding into the Paramount Network,\u2026", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/2way14.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516165200.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
