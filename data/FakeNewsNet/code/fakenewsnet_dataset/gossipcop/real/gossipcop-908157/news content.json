This scandal damaged more than Jax and Brittany\u2019s relationship.\n\nTom Sandoval and Ariana Madix, the couple that never fights (on camera, at least), ended up engaging in a screaming match on camera after Ariana showed Brittany the audio that Faith recorded during her hookup with Jax. Tom couldn\u2019t believe that she did this at Brittany\u2019s housewarming party when she (and everyone else) was wasted and Ariana avidly defended her decision.\n\nTom made it clear that he wasn\u2019t just siding with his boy Jax when he got into it with Ariana and that viewers thinking he wasn\u2019t on Brittany\u2019s side is the \u201cbiggest misconception.\u201d\n\nHis issue wasn\u2019t that Ariana showed Brittany the recording. It was more about the timing and state of drunkenness. In an interview with Daily Pop, \u201cIf anything I was more on Brittany\u2019s side, it\u2019s just that Brittany was so drunk that the last thing I wanted her to do is hear something that traumatic in that state of mind.\u201d\n\nObviously Brittany deserved to know what Jax was saying behind her back. Lala Kent had a valid point when she told Ariana, \u201cDo you want to ruin her night or do you want to ruin her life?\u201d On the other hand, why couldn\u2019t they just meet up for a hangover brunch the next day and talk to her then? In the grand scheme of things, there is no \u201cprivate\u201d way to share this with Brittany since they are filming a reality TV show. Even one-on-one conversations make it into the episodes.\n\nBrittany finding out while she\u2019s wasted in a room with the entire cast made for great TV, but it had to be a rough night for her.\n\nRELATED: Ariana Madix Discusses \u201cRipple Effect\u201d Jax Taylor\u2019s Cheating Had On Her Relationship With Tom Sandoval\n\nTELL US- WAS THE HOUSEWARMING PARTY THE RIGHT TIME TO TELL BRITTANY ABOUT THE RECORDING?\n\n[Photo Credit: Bravo]", "images": ["https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/logo-stacked.svg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2018/07/NUP_183475_0277-236x140.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://cdn1-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2019/02/IMG_3741-236x140.jpg", "https://secure-au.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-evolve&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/twitter-icon.svg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/logo-th.svg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2019/02/clint-shocked-love-after-lockup-236x140.jpg", "https://cdn1-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/pinterest-icon.svg", "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2018/01/vpr-tom-ariana-fight-min.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036161&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2018/06/logo_realitytea.svg", "https://cdn1-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2019/07/NUP_187550_0471-e1562906593325-236x140.jpg", "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/facebook-icon.svg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/rss-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2018/01/vpr-tom-ariana-fight-min.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.realitytea.com/2018/01/29/tom-sandoval-explains-argument-ariana-madix-recording-insists-brittany-cartwrights-side-jax-taylor-cheated/", "title": "Tom Sandoval Explains His Argument With Ariana Madix Over The Recording; Insists He Was On Brittany Cartwright\u2019s Side When Jax Taylor Cheated On Her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=1.0,initial-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Tom Sandoval Explains His Argument With Ariana Madix Over The Recording; Insists He Was On Brittany Cartwright's Side When Jax Taylor Cheated On Her", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tom Sandoval Explains His Argument With Ariana Madix Over The Recording; Insists He Was On Brittany Cartwright's Side When Jax Taylor Cheated On Her - Reality Tea", "description": "Tom Sandoval Explains His Argument With Ariana Madix Over The Recording; Insists He Was On Brittany Cartwright's Side When Jax Taylor Cheated On Her", "url": "https://www.realitytea.com/2018/01/29/tom-sandoval-explains-argument-ariana-madix-recording-insists-brittany-cartwrights-side-jax-taylor-cheated/", "site_name": "Reality Tea", "updated_time": "2018-01-29T06:27:19-05:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2018/01/vpr-tom-ariana-fight-min.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2018/01/vpr-tom-ariana-fight-min.jpg", "width": 768, "height": 432, "alt": "Tom Sandoval blames Ariana Madix"}}, "article": {"tag": "Vanderpump Rules", "section": "Vanderpump Rules", "published_time": "2018-01-29T16:00:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-29T06:27:19-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Tom Sandoval Explains His Argument With Ariana Madix Over The Recording; Insists He Was On Brittany Cartwright's Side When Jax Taylor Cheated On Her", "title": "Tom Sandoval Explains His Argument With Ariana Madix Over The Recording; Insists He Was On Brittany Cartwright's Side When Jax Taylor Cheated On Her - Reality Tea", "image": "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2018/01/vpr-tom-ariana-fight-min.jpg", "creator": "@ReenaRachel"}, "google-site-verification": "LBqyyLK8qWrqIWY868cC4RSBMNqyCO6IaDcvqmgonVc"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517202000.0, "source": "https://www.realitytea.com", "summary": ""}
