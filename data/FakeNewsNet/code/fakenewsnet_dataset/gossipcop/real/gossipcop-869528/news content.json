Weiss have responded to criticism of their planned HBO drama series that imagines a modern-day America where slavery is legal, calling the outrage \u201ca little premature.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the network announced Confederate, a new series from the showrunners of the channel\u2019s Emmy-winning, worldwide sensation, Game of Thrones. The alternate-history tale chronicles events leading to the \u201cThird American Civil War,\u201d where the Southern states have successfully seceded from the Union, and slavery has evolved into a modern institution. Online reaction to the concept ranged from curious and excited to shocked and appalled, with some detractors accusing HBO of making a show that sounds like a white supremacist fantasy.\n\nOn Thursday, Benioff and Weiss \u2014 along with producers Nichelle Tramble Spellman (Justified) and Malcolm Spellman (Empire) \u2014 spoke to Vulture about the project and the backlash it received, with Benioff noting no scripts for Confederate have been written yet.\n\n\u201cSo everything is brand new and nothing\u2019s been written,\u201d Benioff said of the show. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what was a little bit surprising about some of the outrage. It\u2019s just a little premature. You know, we might f\u2014 it up. But we haven\u2019t yet.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Dive Deep Into GOT\u2018s Premiere Episode With EW\u2019s Game of Thrones Weekly Podcast\n\nSome Confederate critics took issue with Benioff and Weiss tackling this subject as white men, though their project has two notable writer-producers of color on board, the Spellmans, both of whom said audiences should wait before judging the final product.\n\n\u201cI do understand their concern,\u201d Nichelle Tramble Spellman said. \u201cI wish their concern had been reserved to the night of the premiere, on HBO, on a Sunday night, when they watched and then they made a decision after they watched an hour of television as to whether or not we succeeded in what we set out to do. The concern is real. But I think that the four of us are very thoughtful, very serious, and not flip about what we are getting into in any way. What I\u2019ve done in the past, what Malcolm has done in the past, what the D.B.s have done in the past, proves that. So I would have loved an opportunity for the conversation to start once the show was on the air.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot litigate this on Twitter. It\u2019s not possible,\u201d added Malcolm Spellman. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we can change anyone\u2019s mind\u2026 but what people have to understand is, and what we are obligated to repeat in every interview is: We\u2019ve got black aunties. We\u2019ve got black nephews, uncles. Black parents and black grandparents. We deal with them every single day. We deal with the struggle every single day. And people don\u2019t have to get on board with what we\u2019re doing based on a press release. But when they\u2019re writing about us, and commenting about us, they should be mindful of the fact that there are no sell-outs involved in this show. Me and Nichelle are not props being used to protect someone else. We are people who feel a need to address issues the same way they do, and they should at least humanize the other end of those tweets and articles.\u201d\n\nRead the full interview over at Vulture.\n\nTo stay up to date on everything Game of Thrones, follow our all-encompassing Facebook page and sign up for our exclusive newsletter\n\nConfederate is said to follow \u201ca broad swath of characters on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Demilitarized Zone \u2013 freedom fighters, slave hunters, politicians, abolitionists, journalists, the executives of a slave-holding conglomerate, and the families of people in their thrall.\u201d\n\nThe concept bears some similarity to Amazon\u2019s drama series The Man in the High Castle, which imagines what would happen if German and Japan had won World War II. That series, based Philip K. Dick\u2019s novel, has largely escaped criticism, yet also isn\u2019t about Southern state slavery. Another series that comes to mind is Hulu\u2019s acclaimed dystopian drama The Handmaids Tale, adapted from the book by Margaret Atwood, which posits a future in which most women are infertile, and those who are able to bear children serve as reproductive slaves for the wealthy.\n\nConfederate has been ordered straight to series and is expected to get underway after the eighth and final season of Thrones airs in either 2018 or 2019.\n\nImage zoom\n\nBenioff and Weiss are no strangers to generating controversy on Thrones, a drama that\u2019s tackled the subject of slavery, albeit wrapped in a fantasy setting. The show has also been accused of not having a diverse enough cast (most recently by Star Wars actor John Boyega), though there are several actors of color among its supporting ensemble. The showrunners have previously said they try to avoid paying attention to online reactions and instead focus on making the best show they can.\n\n\u201cYou look at a message board and there might be nine positive comments, but the 10th one is negative \u2014 and that\u2019s the one you\u2019ll remember, that\u2019s what sticks in your head,\u201d Benioff told EW a few years back. \u201cAnd you want to have an argument with the person: \u2018Well, here\u2019s why this happened [in the show],\u2019 and you can\u2019t. You start having an argument in your mind, and you realize you\u2019re losing your mind. You\u2019re having an internal argument with somebody named DragonQueen42. You\u2019re never going to win that argument.\u201d", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/4-helen-sloan-hbo-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/got_webtout_612x111_v3_final.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/thrones-couples-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/d-b-weiss-and-david-benioff-photo-taken-by-art-streiber-august14.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/netflix-tvs.jpg", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/amazon.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8507038badc1c41adb48fd6b51538fbd?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/euphoria-2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/beyond-the-wall.jpg?crop=633px%2C42px%2C1070px%2C1071px&resize=150%2C150"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/d-b-weiss-and-david-benioff-photo-taken-by-art-streiber-august14.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/20/game-of-thrones-creators-confederate-backlash/", "title": "Game of Thrones creators respond to slavery drama backlash", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Game of Thrones, Game of Thrones creators, Confederate, Confederate show, HBO Confederate,", "news_keywords": "Game of Thrones, Game of Thrones creators, Confederate, Confederate show, HBO Confederate,", "description": "The show will imagine an alternate history where slavery is still legal and the North and South are about to engage in a third Civil War.", "og": {"title": "'Game of Thrones' Creators Respond to Slavery Drama Backlash", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/20/game-of-thrones-creators-confederate-backlash/", "description": "'You cannot litigate this on Twitter.
