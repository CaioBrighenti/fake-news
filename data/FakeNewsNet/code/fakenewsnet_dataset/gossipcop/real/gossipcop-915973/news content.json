Gigi Hadid carried a puppy on the runway at Milan Fashion Week, and some people were pissed. And after you find out the details, you might be, too.\n\nAs Teen Vogue pointed out, when Hadid walked in accessory designer Tod\u2019s show, she proudly carried a live French Bulldog by her side as she showed off a cozy brown coat and matching oversized bag. Hadid looked amazing and smiled the whole time, as most of us do when we\u2019re in the presence of a puppy. And speaking of the puppies? Well, they were ridiculously adorable. However, people are wondering if puppies being used as accessories crosses a line somewhere. This is especially the case since the designer does use real leather in his designs\u2026which comes from other live animals.\n\nTo be totally fair, Hadid wasn\u2019t the only one carrying a puppy down the runway \u2014 it was part of the designer\u2019s vision for the show, and many of the other models hit the runway with puppies in tow. But right now, she\u2019s getting all the heat. Twitter is already ripping her for it.\n\nGigi-with-puppy at Tod's. Interesting accessory choice for a leather house.... pic.twitter.com/YHyMYHM5wu \u2014 Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 23, 2018\n\nTod's had puppies on the runway!!! DOGS! (Also Tod's uses animal leather for their clothing so this also feels kinda creepy) \u2014 paz (@breadpeas__) February 23, 2018\n\nfalse\n\nfalse\n\nPeople are definitely making good points in these tweets, but Hadid was also just doing her job. She was working for the designer by walking in the show and followed directions by carrying the dog. There\u2019s no evidence that these dogs were harmed or mistreated \u2014 although, in the middle of a fashion show surrounded by people and bright lights, there was definitely the possibility for chaos.\n\nIn the end, everyone made it out unscathed, and these puppies got a few extra cuddles that day.\n\nJudging by this backlash, it\u2019d be surprising if puppies ever make an appearance at fashion week again. Kind of a bummer, but maybe it\u2019s what\u2019s best for them. Anyone else suddenly dying to go out and get a good boy of their own?", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09101322/Ariana-Grande-in-My-head-Video.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/20140158/branstark.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02104813/tgif-comedies-family-matters-e1562089707800.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/12130629/latenight-mindykaling.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/14070645/lili-reinhart-chemical-hearts-e1560521229941.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/05144006/big-e1522964416645.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/30045435/cersei.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/30152125/do-the-right-thing.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/14204711/whitneyhouston.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01111121/Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/23032305/gigi_hadid.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09090218/gordon-e1562688256883.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28105746/charlies-angels1-e1561744715378.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/31121716/booksmart.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/20102635/friends-e1545330449309.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28102729/Yung-Baby-Tate.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/11081604/gettyimages-1148329706.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072524/avatar-c-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01095706/melissa-mccarthy-e1562000253438.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/24081819/Beyonce-Coachella.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/04064530/beyonce-nala.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28083732/One-Day-at-a-Time.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/23032305/gigi_hadid.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Pomarico"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/gigi-hadid-carrying-puppy-milan-fashion-week/", "title": "People are not thrilled with Gigi Hadid for carrying a puppy down the runway at Milan Fashion Week", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "fashion week,gigi hadid,gigi hadid fashion,puppies,Entertainment,Lifestyle", "news_keywords": "fashion week,gigi hadid,gigi hadid fashion,puppies,Entertainment,Lifestyle", "description": "Gigi Hadid carried a puppy down the runway at Milan Fashion Week, and people are not happy with her or the designer's choice to use live animals.", "og": {"title": "People are not thrilled with Gigi Hadid for carrying a puppy down the runway at Milan Fashion Week", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/gigi-hadid-carrying-puppy-milan-fashion-week/", "description": "This could have ended badly.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/23032305/gigi_hadid.jpg", "width": 604, "height": 683}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/gigi-hadid-carrying-puppy-milan-fashion-week/", "description": "Gigi Hadid carried a puppy down the runway at Milan Fashion Week, and people are not happy with her or the designer's choice to use live animals.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/23032305/gigi_hadid.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/gigi-hadid-carrying-puppy-milan-fashion-week/", "title": "People are not thrilled with Gigi Hadid for carrying a puppy down the runway at Milan Fashion Week", "description": "This could have ended badly.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/23032305/gigi_hadid.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
