While the bulk of it seems to be about his breakups with Selena Gomez and Bella Hadid, the clearest Gomez track seems to be the album's opening number, \"Call Out My Name\".\n\nThe song describes the pain The Weeknd went through when they split at the end of October because he still loved her, and at one point even suggests The Weeknd nearly donated his kidney to her(!!).( Gomez revealed she got a kidney transplant last summer when she and The Weeknd were still dating.)\n\nHere, an analysis of the lyrics (via Genius), which were written by Frank Dukes, Nicolas Jaar and The Weeknd. While all their experiences could have inspired this track, there's a lot of Abelena in this:\n\nWe found each other\n\nI helped you out of a broken place\n\nThe Weeknd and Selena Gomez started dating officially in January 2017. Their relationship came after she returned to the public spotlight in November 2016 after canceling the rest of her tour abruptly at the end of August and going on hiatus to seek treatment for her lupus-induced anxiety and depression. Right before the announcement, Gomez and her on-off ex Justin Bieber, who was then dating Sofia Richie, had a big blowout argument via Instagram comments. Global outlets covered the scandal.\n\n\n\nYou gave me comfort\n\nBut falling for you was my mistake\n\nThroughout their relationship, Gomez was super PDA-y with The Weeknd. In most images they shared of each other and photos paparazzi took of them, Gomez was very cuddly with Tesfaye. She also followed him around the world during his tour\u2014a comfort to him on the road\u2014and they dated for nearly 10 months.\n\nInstagram\n\nPre-Chorus:\n\nI put you on top, I put you on top\n\nI claimed you so proud and openly\n\nGomez did appear on Tesfaye's Instagram a number of times. Tesfaye made things Instagram official with Gomez pretty early on too: during their first big vacation to Italy at the end of January, she appeared in his Instagram story.\n\nInstagram\n\nHe also celebrated her achievements on his Instagram story, like her Puma and Coach campaigns.\n\nInstagram\n\nAnd when times were rough, when times were rough\n\nI made sure I held you close to me\n\nGomez had a rough year in 2017 with her kidney transplant and health struggle leading up to it.\n\nChorus:\n\nSo call out my name (call out my name)\n\nCall out my name when I kiss you so gently\n\nI want you to stay (want you to stay)\n\nI want you to stay, even though you don't want me\n\nToward the end of their relationship, Gomez and Tesfaye spent an increasing amount of time apart. Gomez was shooting a Woody Allen movie in New York. Tesfaye was traveling across the U.S on tour. \"The distance was okay in the beginning and they were trying to make it work but then Selena really needed more than what The Weeknd could give her,\" a source told E! of why they fell apart. \"She needed him more present. The fights were not huge, just happening more frequently as time wore on. Selena and Abel both agreed that this relationship wasn't going to work due to his busy schedule, but Selena was the one who wanted to end it. She didn't feel secure while he was away, and the schedule conflicts got very exhausting for her.\"\n\nGirl, why can't you wait? (Why can't you wait, baby?)\n\nGirl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?\n\nWon't you call out my name? (Call out my name)\n\nGirl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way\n\nI'll be on my-\n\nDuring Gomez's 25th birthday, The Weeknd literally put up an Instagram story that said \"On my way.\" He had been in Paris performing and got a flight back immediately to Los Angeles to be there for her after.\n\nVerse 2:\n\nI said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied\n\nThe Weeknd has sung before about being detached and casual in relationships and in it for sex more than love. When news of the breakup broke, E!'s source made it seem like Tesfaye wasn't bothered. \"Abel is not upset about Selena and Justin hanging out. Their relationship was over before they were hanging out. Abel is not dwelling over anything.\"\n\n\n\nI almost cut a piece of myself for your life\n\nThe Weeknd suggests here that he almost donated his kidney to Gomez and that he tested to see if he was a match. During that summer, Gomez was in desperate need of a donor. As best friend and donor, Francia Raisa, said of that time on the Today show, \"[Selena] goes, \u2018I don\u2019t know what to do, the [donor wait] list is 7 to 10 years long. And it just vomited out of me. I was like, \u2018Of course I\u2019ll get tested.\u2019\"\n\n\"She lived with me in this interesting time where my kidneys were just done,\" Gomez herself said. \"That was it. I didn\u2019t want to ask a single person in my life. The thought of asking somebody to do that was really difficult for me. She volunteered and did it\u2014and let alone somebody wanting to volunteer, it is incredibly difficult to find a match. The fact that she was a match, I mean, that\u2019s unbelievable. That\u2019s not real.\"\n\nWATCH: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask a single person in my life.\u201d @selenagomez & @therealfrancia speak out on kidney donation process pic.twitter.com/tj1Ri1dED8 \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 30, 2017\n\nThe Weeknd reportedly scheduled his tour around Gomez's transplant procedure so he could be there for her.\n\n\n\nGuess I was just another pit stop\n\n'Til you made up your mind\n\nGomez would ultimately get back together with her on-off boyfriend Justin Bieber shortly after breaking up with The Weeknd. Gomez and Bieber appear to be on a break now.\n\n\n\nYou just wasted my time\n\nYou're on top\n\nGomez is the most followed celebrity on Instagram. The Weeknd could be alluding to that top star status.\n\nPre-Chorus:\n\nI put you on top\n\nI claimed you so proud and openly, babe\n\nAnd when times were rough, when times were rough\n\nI made sure I held you close to me\n\nChorus:\n\nSo call out my name (call out my name, baby)\n\nSo call out my name when I kiss you\n\nSo gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)\n\nI want you to stay even though you don't want me\n\nGirl, why can't you wait?
