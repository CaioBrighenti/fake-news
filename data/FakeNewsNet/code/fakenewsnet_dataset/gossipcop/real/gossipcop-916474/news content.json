We are blessed beyond measure. We have everything we need,\u201d the message read. Included in the message was a photo of Psalm, bundled up in blankets while lying in a see-through acrylic crib.\n\nThe reality star previously opened up to Architectural Digest about her now-16-month-old daughter Chicago\u2018s nursery, including the unique crib she has seen a lot of use out of already with son Saint, 3 and daughter North, 6 next month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty much using the same crib and everything that I had for our other kids,\u201d said Kardashian West said at the time. \u201cWe have a Vetro Lucite crib and we have a Roy\u00e8re bed in there and a really fluffy cream rug.\u201d\n\nBeyhive members may recognize the $4,200 crib as the same one the 37-year-old singer and husband JAY-Z purchased for their daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

piece of nursery furniture the new mom of three cherishes greatly: her glider.\n\n\u201cI have a glider with an ottoman for feeding,\u201d she told Architectural Digest. \u201cWith the first baby, I had a rocking chair, and I just love a glider so much more \u2014 you can move easier.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250",
