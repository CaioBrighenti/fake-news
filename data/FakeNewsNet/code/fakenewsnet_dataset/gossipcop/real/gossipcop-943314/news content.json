Cafont Croissant,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cIt, like, goes together, there\u2019s no separating the two.\u201d\n\nDuff announced on June 8 that she and boyfriend Matthew Koma are expecting their first child together, a baby girl. She shares Luca, 6, with ex-husband Mike Comrie.\n\n\u201cThe beginning was a little\u2026 he was surprised, and now he\u2019s warming up to the idea,\u201d Duff said of Luca on Monday night. \u201cI think it\u2019s a girl, but he told his friends at school the other day that he\u2019s having a sister that\u2019s part red-butt monkey, so we\u2019ll see. We never know.\u201d\n\nThe former Disney star finalized their divorce in 2016, more than two years after their initial split. She and Koma began dating in January 2017. They split that March, but reconciled months later.\n\n\u201cI think [if] you have history and a past with someone and love \u2014 and just because it doesn\u2019t work out the first time, the second time, as long as there\u2019s not too much damage done \u2014 then, it can always work out again,\u201d she told The Talk late last year.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/112845_0349b_James-Corden-Hilary-Duff-Sam-Richardson-zoom.jpg?crop=773px%2C367px%2C567px%2C297px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/112845_0349b_James-Corden-Hilary-Duff-Sam-Richardson-zoom.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/175654311_hilary-duff-luca-mike-comrie-zoom-3b633ffd-76db-4d1e-846e-c1d35f869f63.jpg?w=224", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/112845_0349b_James-Corden-Hilary-Duff-Sam-Richardson-zoom.jpg?crop=773px%2C367px%2C567px%2C297px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/hilary-duffs-son-luca-chose-a-unique-name-for-his-future-sister/", "title": "Hilary Duff\u2019s Son Luca Chose a Unique Name for His Future Sister", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Hilary Duff, who is pregnant with her second child, revealed what her son wants to name his future sister \u2013 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hilary Duff\u2019s Son Luca Is Just Now 'Warming Up' to Having a Baby Sister", "description": "Hilary Duff, who is pregnant with her second child, revealed what her son wants to name his future sister \u2013 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/hilary-duffs-son-luca-chose-a-unique-name-for-his-future-sister/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/112845_0349b_James-Corden-Hilary-Duff-Sam-Richardson-zoom.jpg?crop=773px%2C367px%2C567px%2C297px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/112845_0349b_James-Corden-Hilary-Duff-Sam-Richardson-zoom.jpg?crop=773px%2C367px%2C567px%2C297px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Hilary Duff and Sam Richardson on \u2018The Late Late Show with James Corden\u2018"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-06-12T12:37:00+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hilary Duff, who is pregnant with her second child, revealed what her son wants to name his future sister \u2013 get the details!", "title": "Hilary Duff\u2019s Son Luca Is Just Now 'Warming Up' to Having a Baby Sister", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/112845_0349b_James-Corden-Hilary-Duff-Sam-Richardson-zoom.jpg?crop=773px%2C367px%2C567px%2C297px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528807020.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
