Kerr is now engaged to Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel, while Bloom recently split from girlfriend Katy Perry.\n\nWhile the romance may be over, the Pirates of the Caribbean star still had plenty of nice things to say about his supermodel ex-wife when he and Flynn came across one of her billboards in China.\n\nAlongside an Instagram photo of his son hugging the poster, he wrote: \u201cWe came across this billboard in China while he was visiting me on set. He loves his mum and what\u2019s not to love \u2014 she\u2019s a wonderful mother, a great friend and co parent. So blessed and grateful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s publicly praised Kerr\u2019s parenting skills.\n\nJust three weeks ago, the actor posted a photo of his son\u2019s birthday present for her, along with the caption: \u201cHAPPY BIRTHDAY! To an amazing mother, co-parent and friend.\u201d\n\nWhile she\u2019s now happily engaged, just last year Kerr admitted she \u201cfell into a really bad depression\u201d after her breakup with Bloom in 2013.\n\n\u201cWhen Orlando and I separated I actually fell into a really bad depression,\u201d she told Elle Canada .\n\n\u201cI never understood that depth of that feeling or the reality of that because I was naturally a very happy person.\u201d\n\nShe revealed she overcame her troubles using positive thinking and mindfulness, realising that \u201cevery thought you have affects your reality and only you have control of your mind.\u201d", "images":
