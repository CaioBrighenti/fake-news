The only way that I'm really able to process stuff is through reflecting it.\"\n\nWhile his mother was ill in a Florida hospital, Oscar comforted her by reading aloud to her from the play.\n\nHe recalled: \"I would just read the play all the time, do bits for her. Me doing Shakespeare was her favourite thing.\n\n\"I didn't know how to process any of this, but this I knew how to do.\"\n\nAnd the 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' actor hopes his performance in the play \"honors\" his beloved parent.", "images": ["https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7411687-oscar-isaac-named-his-son-after-his-late-mother/", "title": "Oscar Isaac named his son after his late mother", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 200654546635181}, "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Hollywood actor Oscar Isaac named his two-month-old son Eugene in honour of his late mother Eugenia, who passed away in February.", "og": {"title": "Oscar Isaac named his son after his late mother", "url": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7411687-oscar-isaac-named-his-son-after-his-late-mother/", "description": "Hollywood actor Oscar Isaac named his two-month-old son Eugene in honour of his late mother Eugenia, who passed away in February.", "type": "Article", "site_name": "BramptonGuardian.com", "image": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png"}, "article": {"section": "WhatsOn-Celebrity", "published_time": "2017-07-07T11:00:12Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-07T11:00:12Z"}, "parsely-title": "Oscar Isaac named his son after his late mother", "parsely-link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7411687-oscar-isaac-named-his-son-after-his-late-mother/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "http://media.zuza.com/9/e/9e73e8c3-2634-41c5-af94-2bb0e2ffb9e3/BS2BS1386017_Image1_Thumbnail.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-07-07T11:00:12Z", "parsely-section": "whatson|celebrity", "parsely-tags": "subcategory:whatson|celebrity,category:whatson,news_source:bangshowbiz,primary_publication:bramptonguardian,video:no,images:1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Communities/bramptonguardian/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499425212.0, "source": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com", "summary": ""}
