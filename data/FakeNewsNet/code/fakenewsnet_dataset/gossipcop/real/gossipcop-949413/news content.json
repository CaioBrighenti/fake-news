God has been too good to us,\u201d Ayesha captioned a black-and-white photo of Canon with his big sisters.\n\n\u201cOur beautiful baby boy Canon W.Jack Curry 7/2/2018.

All the Celebrity Babies Born in 2018 \u2014 So Far\n\nPrior to the announcement of their baby\u2019s birth, the couple did not reveal the sex. In February, Steph told Ellen DeGeneres that he was the one pressuring his wife not to find out what they were having \u2014 even though the results were on her phone.\n\n\u201cI would love to get to the delivery room and have that surprise. I\u2019ve heard stories on both ends of finding out early, finding out when the baby was born. But she\u2019s a planner, she wants to know,\u201d he said.\n\nImage zoom Ayesha Curry/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ayesha Curry Is Feeling \u201cAwful\u201d Four and a Half Months Into Her Third Pregnancy\n\n\n\nThat same month, Ayesha revealed her prenatal journey had not been an easy one thus far.\n\n\u201cI still have nausea, can\u2019t sleep, pee every five seconds and am just so darn tired. I have what docs call Hyperemesis. This basically means the nausea, incessant sickness and exhaustion probably won\u2019t go away,\u201d she blogged on her co-founded lifestyle community goInspo.\n\n\u201cThe only silver linings here are that my itty-bitty baby is healthy and Princess Kate has suffered from the same condition during her pregnancies. Not feeling super royal though,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd there could be more Curry kids in their future. \u201c[Steph would] have three more kids right now if he could,\u201d Ayesha, who released a cookbook that fall, said in the June 2016 issue of Parents magazine.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/drake-steph-curry.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/beyonce-blue-ivy-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C326px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/par0319_cover_hi.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ayesha-curry.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/58468321_140487400408938_5716238902707820464_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/ayesha-curry-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hoda-kotb-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C34px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/673513.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bdays-5-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/myka-stauffer-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C839px%2C1125px%2C591px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/steph-curry.jpg?crop=0px%2C39px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/stormi-7-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C654px%2C1926px%2C1012px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mario-lopez-baby.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2602px%2C1366.05px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jen-ayesha.jpg?crop=0px%2C330px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ayesha-curry.jpg?crop=0px%2C656px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/curry-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C162px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ayesha-curry-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/john-stamos-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C137px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/psalm-west.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2490px%2C1307.25px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/danielle-fishel-baby.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/joanna-gaines.jpg?crop=101px%2C552px%2C1079px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/khloecc81-kardashian1.jpg?crop=0px%2C173px%2C2400px%2C1261px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/673513.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/673513.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/stephen-curry-ayesha-welcome-son-canon-w-jack/", "title": "Ayesha and Stephen Curry Welcome Third Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Ayesha Curry,Babies,Babies Photos,Births,E-Commerce,Kids,News,Stephen Curry", "news_keywords": "Ayesha Curry,Babies,Babies Photos,Births,E-Commerce,Kids,News,Stephen Curry", "description": "Steph and Ayesha Curry's new addition joins big sisters Ryan, who turns 3 on July 10, and Riley, who turns 6 on July 19", "og": {"title": "'Family of 5!'
