Once with two emjois \u2014 the monkey covering its eyes and the blushing smiling face \u2014 and once with a Harry Potter joke.\n\n\u201cU tryna slytherin (i\u2019m deleting my account now),\u201d the pop star wrote.\n\nFollowing their respective splits earlier this month \u2014 Davidson from Cazzie David and Grande from Mac Miller \u2014 the two have been rumored to be an item after being spotted together by a source at an SNL after-party.\n\nAfter Grande called her relationship with Miller \u201ctoxic\u201d in a lengthy post to Twitter, some fans questioned rumored beau Davidson\u2019s fitness for a healthy relationship. Last year, the actor revealed that he suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder.\n\n\"Normally I wouldn't comment on something like this cause like f**k you,\" Davidson wrote on his Instagram Story. \"But I've been hearing a lot of 'people with BPD can't be in relationships' talk. I just wanna let you know that's not true. Just because someone has a mental illness does not mean they can't be happy and in a relationship. It also doesn't mean that person makes a relationship toxic.\"\n\nDavidson continued: \"I just think it's f**ked up to stigmatize people as crazy and say that they are unable to do stuff that anyone can do. It's not their fault and it's the wrong way for people to look at things. I may be crazy but at least I'm aware of it and not afraid to be honest about it and I'm not hiding behind a Twitter or Instagram account.\"\n\nHere's more on Davidson and Grande's relationship:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nAriana Grande Says She 'Cried 10 Hundred Times' While Writing New Album\n\nAriana Grande Shares a Pic of Her Bee Tattoo in Tribute to Manchester Bombing Anniversary\n\nAriana Grande's Rumored Boyfriend Pete Davidson Says Mental Illness Doesn't Make a Relationship 'Toxic'\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-05/Vin_Diesel_GettyImages-963776882_1280.jpg?itok=Uo5LCqUf&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/et_052118_arianadatingvp.png?itok=s6XiW0l8", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161760651.jpg?itok=MLRyG4zA&h=bd7808dd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-05/amazon-prime-day-beauty-sales-1280.jpg?itok=FIL40h13&h=f7474839", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-05/et_052118_arianadatingvp.png?itok=L5M9q7Ca&h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/et_052118_arianadatingvp.png?itok=s6XiW0l8", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paige Gawley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/ariana-grande-and-pete-davidson-make-their-relationship-instagram-official-103230", "title": "Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson Make Their Relationship Instagram Official", "meta_data": {"title": "Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson Make Their Relationship Instagram Official  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ariana-grande-and-pete-davidson-make-their-relationship-instagram-official-103230", "title": "Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson Make Their Relationship Instagram Official", "description": "\u201cThe chamber of secrets has been opened.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/et_052118_arianadatingvp.png?itok=s6XiW0l8", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u201cThe chamber of secrets has been opened.\"", "title": "Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson Make Their Relationship Instagram Official", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Paige Gawley\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ariana-grande-and-pete-davidson-make-their-relationship-instagram-official-103230", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/et_052118_arianadatingvp.png?itok=s6XiW0l8"}, "description": "\u201cThe chamber of secrets has been opened.\"", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
