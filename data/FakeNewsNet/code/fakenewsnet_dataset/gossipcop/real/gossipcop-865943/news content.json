Heidi Gutman/Bravo\n\nTo read the recap for part two of the reunion, click here.\n\nFirst, let me just say, that was so nice of Bravo to give the set designer, all the producers, whoever coordinates reunion outfits and basically everyone with fully functioning vision and a tiny bit of taste the night off!\n\nI mean, other than Andy Cohen. He obviously had to be there.\n\nPlus, I can\u2019t imagine this visual boat wreck of a reunion was in any way his fault.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to The Island Packet content across all your devices. SAVE NOW\n\nBut how thoughtful!\n\nI wonder who covered for them ... was it a high school prom committee whose theme was \u201cRocky Horror Grandma\u2019s House\u201d? Or was it contestants on an off-brand reality game show? Like \u201cProject Run Away\u201d or \u201cCelebrity You\u2019re Fired\u201d?\n\nI can think of no decision that would\u2019ve resulted in such thematically disparate visuals other than the bizarro kind that get made by two committees of out-for-themselfers competing against each other on lame TV.\n\nOK. Maybe I\u2019m being too harsh. Maybe.\n\nLet\u2019s just look at the evidence. Let\u2019s just ask ourselves some critical questions here.\n\nFor instance, was that set supposed to be a replica of Patricia\u2019s living room? If so, God why? And was that fake staircase in the background seriously painted on the wall? If not, it seemed that way, which is to say it looked faker than actual fake but I\u2019m sure this set totally killed it in Hillcrest Elementary School\u2019s significantly toned-down production of \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d\n\nAnother question: Why was the cast not told \u201cWear variations on a theme from this classy color palette\u201d?\n\nAnd why oh why ... wait. I have to break this down by cast member, and Austen and Craig are the only ones who get a full fashion pass from me because First Place, Second Place in that order.\n\nEveryone else: last place.\n\nKathryn: separate contest altogether, but I\u2019ll get to that.\n\nMy questions:\n\nWas Landon on her way to a \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d-themed mixer for old maids? Or was she pretending to be the spazzy ghost of a second-class passenger on the Titanic? Or was she modeling a graduation dress from Belk?\n\nDoes Victoria\u2019s Secret sell maternity clothes now? I know that\u2019s mean, Cameran is perfect 99 percent of the time, but come on ... her dress looked like one of those creepy cut-out bras that only 4 percent of its buyers know how to wear appropriately. Also, if it\u2019s pink and black, there\u2019s probably a word written across the butt.\n\nI\u2019m not done.\n\nDid Shep look back on his Season 3 reunion (sponsored by Band-Aid?) look, shudder and say \u201cThis time we\u2019re doing things my way, Bravo, and my way is off the floor, at the very last minute, using the socks I stole off the Wicked Witch of the West and absolutely, positively not involving someone spitting on their hand and smoothing my hair down?\u201d\n\nDid Thomas get distracted while doing his very private but weekly \u201cPut on Daddy\u2019s Sunday Supper Suit and stand in front of the mirror while whispering \u2018I\u2019m Arthur Ravenel. Pass the biscuits! Pass the spiral ham! My son Thomas is, in fact, not a disappointment! And when I pass, the bridge should be renamed after him\u2019\u201d routine and forget to change into his reunion outfit?\n\nAnd did Naomie ask her hairdresser to make her side-waves hair look like the \u201cafter\u201d to Landon\u2019s \u201cbefore\u201d in a commercial for anti-frizz spray?\n\nBecause it did.\n\nI think I\u2019ve made my case. This was a reunion of people who got very different invitations in the mail.\n\nAnd I haven\u2019t even mentioned Kathryn\u2019s dress.\n\nBut I\u2019m gonna.\n\nLet\u2019s start with other notations from my Big Book of Observations first, though:\n\n\u2014 I had forgotten that Austen showed his Coppertone butt during that first episode. (Likely because I was still confused by his presence on the show.) Holy little lady, that tan line was amazing and impressive. I\u2019m obsessed with it. If I were Chelsea I would\u2019ve begged him to let me fill it in with self-tanner lotion \u201cjust to see what happens.\u201d\n\n\u2014 What a bunch of smirkers, right? Again, I have so many questions. But mostly I just have this one and it needs to be answered: Surely there\u2019s no way Craig and Naomie have been faking their relationship woes this entire time ... or do you think? I could totally be wrong but I thought I saw doubting facial pings on the other cast members as Craig and Naomie talked about their problems. The kind of facial pings that say \u201cOh please.\u201d Also, looking back it really seems like those two offered us an awfully quick and tidy clean-up to their issues in that finale, no? Literally Naomie owned up to everything Craig accused her of being. And I know I\u2019m a sad person for wishing this, but I hope those two weren\u2019t faking it because that would make them gross ... I also hope they make it. Gizmo can\u2019t be going to two houses at Christmas. It\u2019s just not fair.\n\n\u2014 Craig got beaten up and I\u2019m annoyed at myself for kind of enjoying his reactions. It\u2019s so kid brother. One minute he\u2019s giving the camera Dejected Face because they\u2019re busting on his \u201cjack of all trades, master of none\u201d season and his future in gardening law. The next he\u2019s giving the camera Damn It, I\u2019m Smiling Face because they\u2019re making a funny joke about how his blabber would be an asset for a job that bills by the hour and he can\u2019t help but laugh at that incorrigible truth about himself.\n\n\u2014 I\u2019ll say it again, Craig and Austen put some effort into their appearances. Even their skin looked great. That\u2019s all. A-plus, dermatologists of Charleston.\n\n\u2014 Two things. One, Thomas accusing Craig of having \u201ctumbleweed blowing around\u201d between his ears is LOL because Thomas should be so lucky, and two, the proof of that is how proud Thomas looked \u201ccoming up\u201d with that saying. It\u2019s about as original as his inability to have a mature and monogamous relationship.\n\n\u2014 THAT WAS A DEAD LEG! I have to say, I like Shep and all, but I could watch Craig hit him on the leg on repeat for the rest of my life and die happy. Hilarious. The look on Craig\u2019s face when he did it! Shep is so right, though ... Craig is such an easy target.\n\n\u2014 Speaking of, I don\u2019t believe Craig got that cheese-oral sex question from a women\u2019s studies class. I think he got it from Gizmo (who was hoping to stop all the contorted facial atrocities he\u2019s had to witness in that bedroom and, you know, maybe attract a few mice to the joint in the meantime).\n\n\u2014 Thomas\u2019 dumb wink-face when Craig gave Kathryn his handkerchief made me want to drill a spigot into his temple, drain out the contents of his head, bottle it up and sell it under the brand name THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDN\u2019T DATE AN OLDER MAN. THEY\u2019RE SMUG ABOUT THEIR POWER OVER YOU. Sorry. Flashbacks ... I\u2019m putting the spigot down. And this mallet.\n\n\u2014 This week on Sexame Street: \u201cShe\u2019s a manipulative XYZ\u201d and \u201cI would do XYZ\u201d and \u201cHe and I suffer from ABC\u201d ... stay tuned for next week when Big Bird dyes himself red to match a certain dress and the Count gives a rousing enumeration of the Cialis tabs he has left.\n\n\u2014 Exchange of the night: \u201cShould I go to a monastery and collect bees?\u201d \u201cNo. You should just cut down on your drinking.\u201d Shep on the only other alternatives to not partying (?) and Andy Cohen on common freaking sense. Shep at a monastery though ...\n\n\u2014 Edit of the night: \u201cI think people project a lot of things they don\u2019t like about themselves onto other people.\u201d Kathryn about Shep\u2019s angry-drunk persona right as the camera flashes to Landon\u2019s face\n\n\u2014 Most authentic moment of the night: \u201cI hate that I don\u2019t have self-control. I hate that after a few beers everything sounds like a good idea.\u201d Shep on his drinking, which ... at what point do we all worry? He\u2019s going to be OK, right? It\u2019s not as bad as it looks, right? I guess we\u2019ll have to find out on \u201cRelationShep\u201d\n\n\u2014 Things I believe: Landon read about Kathryn\u2019s drug use online before the reunion. Landon also validated it by bringing it up at the reunion. Kathryn ordered that margarita to be like \u201cI\u2019m not a freak. See?\u201d Kathryn drank that margarita.\n\n\u2014 Things I don\u2019t believe: Landon\u2019s strange tears. I want to! I really do. But no. No. Regardless of her sincerity she totally stole that moment from Kathryn. Kathryn was having a genuine emotional moment about her anxiety and \u201cmarijuana addiction\u201d (get real, Thomas) and not being able to trust the people in her life and then Edina Monsoon is like \u201cSquish squish, sweetie. Mama\u2019s crying too, sweetie darling. See? Squish squish.\u201d\n\n\u2014 When Craig handed Kathryn that handkerchief why didn\u2019t Jennifer Snowden use that opportunity to run onto the set and kick in that staircase wall? I would have ...\n\n\u2014 I\u2019m going to hell for this but Jen, your fake tan lady gave you a white hairline stripe. Use that fact to get a year\u2019s worth of free service, though.\n\n\u2014 Thomas to Jennifer: \u201cI did a 180 on you!\u201d The rest of us: \u201cI hope he wiped it off.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Phone calls? Confiding in a supposed friend? Getting stabbed in the back? Where have I heard this before? Oh my God, guys. Jennifer Snowden is Kathryn\u2019s LINDA MOTHER-EFFING TRIPP.\n\nBetter clothes though.\n\nPossibly even less sadness.\n\n\u2014 Remember when Thomas climbed out of the second-floor nursery window in Season 3? It helps to picture that while thinking about his sinister threat to Kathryn at the end of the first part of the reunion. It\u2019s like sucking the lemon after taking the shot.\n\n\u2014 How have I not discussed Kathryn\u2019s hair? That was like \u201cRun Lola Run\u201d meets that epic first episode of \u201cAlias\u201d meets an actual stylist who knows what they\u2019re doing. My compliments to the chef. It was perfect. It was the kind of hair you\u2019d want to have at a face-off with the Enemy. It said \u201cTry me. I\u2019m as lethal as this looks.\u201d\n\n\u2014 All right. Let\u2019s do this. That Dress.\n\nReasons to hate it:\n\n\u25aa It really needs a fruit hat?\n\n\u25aa It looks like Cinderella\u2019s stepsisters already tore it apart in their pre-ball frenzy?\n\n\u25aa I\u2019m sure Elmo already has a drag-queen tribute character dedicated to him?\n\n\u25aa If that dress is here, then what did we bury Madame the \u201cSolid Gold\u201d puppet in?\n\nReasons to love it:\n\n\u25aa Glitter gear, don\u2019t care.\n\nJust like the woman inside it, that Marchesa dress gave zero F\u2019s, a million go F\u2019s and at least a dozen bow down, bishes.\n\nSo what\u2019s not to love?\n\nCatch up on previous episodes of \u201cSouthern Charm\u201d here and \u201cSouthern Charm Savannah\u201d here.", "images": ["https://www.islandpacket.com/wps/build/images/islandpacket/logo.svg", "https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=36501&contextPath=7053-36501&pubId=21&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=160651629&type=article&title=%E2%80%98Southern+Charm%E2%80%99+recap%3A+In+defense+of+Kathryn%E2%80%99s+red+dress+(but+not+Landon%E2%80%99s+very+strange+crying)&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.islandpacket.com%2Fopinion%2Fopn-columns-blogs%2Fliz-farrell%2Farticle160651629.html", "https://www.islandpacket.com/latest-news/qkit8b/picture230138324/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/dgsdgsdgsdg.jpg", "https://www.islandpacket.com/wps/build/images/islandpacket/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.islandpacket.com/latest-news/djox6c/picture211766074/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/gadsenwedDM02.jpg", "https://www.islandpacket.com/latest-news/p2cu5s/picture231570268/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Gruber_KeveanyReportILLIO.jpg", "https://www.islandpacket.com/latest-news/5q4mxi/picture207738594/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Wine.jpeg", "https://www.islandpacket.com/latest-news/ur90tj/picture229478519/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Screen%20Shot%202019-04-19%20at%204.33.41%20PM.png", "https://www.islandpacket.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/liz-farrell/frogvt/picture160651619/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/NUP_178779_1121"], "top_img": "https://www.islandpacket.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/liz-farrell/frogvt/picture160651619/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/NUP_178779_1121", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Farrell"], "canonical_link": "http://www.islandpacket.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/liz-farrell/article160651629.html", "title": "'Southern Charm' recap: In defense of Kathryn Dennis' reunion dress", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/islandpacket/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "islandpacket", "title": "\u2018Southern Charm\u2019 recap: In defense of Kathryn\u2019s red dress (but not Landon\u2019s very strange crying)", "description": "To read the recap for part two of the reunion, click here.", "image": "https://www.islandpacket.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/liz-farrell/frogvt/picture160651619/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/NUP_178779_1121"}, "og": {"site_name": "islandpacket", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Southern Charm\u2019 recap: In defense of Kathryn\u2019s red dress (but not Landon\u2019s very strange crying)", "url": "https://www.islandpacket.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/liz-farrell/article160651629.html", "description": "To read the recap for part two of the reunion, click here.", "image": "https://www.islandpacket.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/liz-farrell/frogvt/picture160651619/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/NUP_178779_1121"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606330409419854, "pages": 120084158072401}, "title": "'Southern Charm' recap: In defense of Kathryn Dennis' reunion dress | Hilton Head Island Packet", "allow-comments": "true", "description": "To read the recap for part two of the reunion, click here.", "keywords": "Southern Charm, recap, reunion, Shep Rose, Landon Clements, Kathryn Dennis, Charleston, Bravo, South Carolina, SC,", "news_keywords": "Southern Charm, recap, reunion, Shep Rose, Landon Clements, Kathryn Dennis, Charleston, Bravo, South Carolina, SC,", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "original-source": "http://www.islandpacket.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/liz-farrell/article160651629.html", "google-site-verification": "2ao-GZvsEZm5gIWn8SChVxk9wgOgFPryVr-cN5XpyIc", "parsely-metadata": "{\"article_id\": \"160651629\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.islandpacket.com", "summary": ""}
