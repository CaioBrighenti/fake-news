He just wanted his daughter back.\" \u2014Eli Mills(src)\n\n\"'Ooh, ah,' that's how it always starts. But then later there's running and screaming.\" This page contains spoilers from an upcoming, or newly released, installment of the Jurassic Park franchise. If you don't want spoilers, leave the page!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLockwood's daughter was the daughter of Benjamin Lockwood, the partner of John Hammond in creation of Jurassic Park and company InGen.\n\nShe was raised by the housekeeper of Lockwood Manor, Iris Carroll.\n\nShe died untimely in a car crash well with her husband before the events of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, causing Benjamin much distress. While Benjamin wanted to bring his daughter back through cloning, Hammond was opposed by the idea. This caused a break in the relationship between the two partners that was seemingly never rekindled. After the death of John Hammond, Lockwood went ahead and cloned her once daughter, resulting in Maisie Lockwood. Lockwood then kept Maisie's past secret to most visitors to the mansion by stating Maisie is his granddaughter, the daughter of his own daughter.\n\nWhile she never makes an appearance in the film, she appears in pictures in Lockwood's scrapbook, and mentioned by Eli Mills when he discovers Maisie by the side of Owen Grady and Claire Dearing.", "images": ["https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jurassicpark/images/6/65/Stegosaurus-header-icon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/100?cb=20150913005617", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kinnikuman/images/7/76/Spotlight_Image_2.png/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20190629204130", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spotlightsimagestemporary/images/4/4c/Glitchtale-en.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20190618182700", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jurassicpark/images/b/b0/Iris_Photograph.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20181112024131", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jurassicpark/images/b/b0/Iris_Photograph.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20181112024131", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/spotlightsimagestemporary/images/d/d2/Habbo-en.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20190618182700", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jurassicpark/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png/revision/latest?cb=20171111223311", "https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb1562940152319/common/extensions/wikia/WikiaBar/images/wikiabarIcon.png"], "top_img": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jurassicpark/images/b/b0/Iris_Photograph.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20181112024131", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://jurassicpark.fandom.com/wiki/Lockwood%27s_Daughter", "title": "Lockwood's Daughter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "generator": "MediaWiki 1.19.24", "keywords": "Jurassic Park wiki,jurassicpark,Lockwood's Daughter,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,Isabella Sermon,Benjamin Lockwood,Eli Mills,John Hammond,Jurassic Park (park),InGen,Lockwood Manor,Iris Carroll,Maisie Lockwood", "description": "Lockwood's daughter was the daughter of Benjamin Lockwood, the partner of John Hammond in creation of Jurassic Park and company InGen.
