She also let us in on her morning routine which includes a VERY early work out and making breakfast for son Romeo.\n\nVictoria finds the time to work out, run a fashion house and still make breakfast for Romeo (CREDIT: Instagram/romeobeckham) \u00a9 Instagram/romeobeckham\n\nShe explained: \u201cI go for a three mile run every morning and I work out for an hour with a PT, which gives me just enough time to get to the kitchen to puree Romeo\u2019s avocados.\n\n\u201cHis toast jumps out of the toaster the minute he comes down for breakfast.\u201d\n\nAnd in terms of facing the aging process she added: \u201cI focus on what I\u2019ve accomplished and I feel blessed.\u201d\n\nWords to live by. It sounds like Victoria really CAN have it all. You go girl.\n\nWhat do you think makes a happy marriage?
