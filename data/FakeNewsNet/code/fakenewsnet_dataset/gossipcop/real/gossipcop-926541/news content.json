But her salary won't compare to his.\n\n\"I'm not making Matt Lauer money,\" Kotb told People. \"Not even close.\"\n\nKotb, who has been with the network since 1998, had been filling in for Lauer since he was fired from NBC in November for \" inappropriate sexual behavior.\" Kotb has also cohosted the fourth hour of \"Today\" with Kathie Lee Gifford since 2008, and will continue to do so moving forward, according to NBC.\n\nPage Six reports (citing \"NBC sources\") that Kotb will make the same as Guthrie: $7 million per year. At the time of his firing, Lauer was making $25 million a year. The salary difference brings to mind the substantial gender wage gap in the United States.\n\nBut Kotb doesn't seem too bothered by the disparity.\n\n\"I think the whole money thing for me, I've always been sort of \u2014 I know it sounds ridiculous that I'm going to say this, but I really have done jobs I liked for the job I liked because I never wanted to be happy every other Friday on pay day,\" she told People. \"Like, I didn't want that to be the happy day.\"", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a4d00c3cf698a253f8b459f-2732-1366.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a4cffae396e3790108b4773-750-500.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a4d00c3cf698a253f8b459f-2732-1366.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carrie Wittmer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/hoda-kotbs-today-salary-reportedly-less-than-a-third-of-matt-lauers-2018-1", "title": "'Today' coanchor Hoda Kotb says NBC isn't paying her close to 'Matt Lauer money' \u2014 and her salary is reportedly less than 1/3 what he made", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-01-03", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-03", "news_keywords": "NBC, Today, Hoda Kotb, Matt Lauer, Carrie Wittmer", "sailthru.tags": "NBC, Today, Hoda Kotb, Matt Lauer, Carrie Wittmer", "description": "According to a Page Six report, Kotb's salary is about $18 million less than Lauer's.", "sailthru.description": "According to a Page Six report, Kotb's salary is about $18 million less than Lauer's.", "title": "'Today' coanchor Hoda Kotb says NBC isn't paying her close to 'Matt Lauer money' \u2014 and her salary is reportedly less than 1/3 what he made", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire, media", "sailthru.title": "'Today' coanchor Hoda Kotb says NBC isn't paying her close to 'Matt Lauer money' \u2014 and her salary is reportedly less than 1/3 what he made", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a4d00c3cf698a253f8b459f-2732-1366.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a4d00ba396e373a028b48b3-2560-1920.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a4d00ba396e373a028b48b3-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "sailthru.author": "Carrie Wittmer", "og": {"title": "'Today' coanchor Hoda Kotb says NBC isn't paying her close to 'Matt Lauer money' \u2014 and her salary is reportedly less than 1/3 what he made", "description": "According to a Page Six report, Kotb's salary is about $18 million less than Lauer's.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/hoda-kotbs-today-salary-reportedly-less-than-a-third-of-matt-lauers-2018-1", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a4d00c3cf698a253f8b459f-2732-1366.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Carrie Wittmer", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/hoda-kotbs-today-salary-reportedly-less-than-a-third-of-matt-lauers-2018-1", "title": "'Today' coanchor Hoda Kotb says NBC isn't paying her close to 'Matt Lauer money' \u2014 and her salary is reportedly less than 1/3 what he made", "description": "According to a Page Six report, Kotb's salary is about $18 million less than Lauer's.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a4d00c3cf698a253f8b459f-2732-1366.jpg", "creator": "@carriesnotscary", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "'Today' coanchor Hoda Kotb says NBC isn't paying her close to 'Matt Lauer money' \u2014 and her salary is reportedly less than 1/3 what he made": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514955600.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
