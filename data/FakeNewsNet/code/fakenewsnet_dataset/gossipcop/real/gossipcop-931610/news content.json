Everywhere you go in L.A. there is a no-carb option. I stayed at that weight because it\u2019s what I thought I should be because I\u2019m already small and I also lost a lot of weight since high school. I used to be a not-healthy 130-lb. girl, all in my stomach, all in my arms so I lost the weight and I stayed there then I became a control freak about the way I was eating and it just became the norm.\u201d\n\nMai says people would also comment on her weight, asking her how she stayed so thin, which felt like a compliment.\n\n\u201cI thought I have what a lot of women want but can\u2019t get so I better stick with it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just think that\u2019s the right thing to do. I fit everything. I fit the model sizes.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Then I had to remind myself, \u2018No, the whole point is to stop over-controlling yourself,\u2019 then I was able to get back on track and eat normally the next day.\u201d\n\nNow Mai says: \u201cI feel more like a woman than I ever have before.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jeannie Mai\n\nShe is also eating many foods she did not dare let herself even take a bite of for over a decade.\n\n\u201cI had the whole burger. I ate the sandwiches. I had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which I haven\u2019t had since I was a kid and that was my favorite basic food,\u201d she says. \u201cI went to Stagecoach and Coachella and stopped at Chick-fil-A. My friends were visiting from Italy and brought pasta. I haven\u2019t had a full plate of pasta in 12 years.\u201d\n\nAlthough she is eating foods that she used to restrict, her main diet focuses on \u201clots of protein, lots of healthy complex carbs, and lots of healthy fats.\u201d\n\nFor her workouts, she goes to the gym 5 times a week to lift heavy weights and goes hiking with her friends for cardio.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to develop curves on my body,\u201d she says. \u201cI never had curves. Now I want to round out my knees, I want my thighs to be just solid and I want a nice good tush, I want to crack walnuts with my butt.\u201d\n\nMai, who separated from her husband of 10 years, Freddy Harteis, in October and has been open about her decision to not have children, adds, \u201cI know one of the blessings of being a mother is getting hips and I\u2019m not going to have that because I chose not to have kids so I believe God is going to give me some hips if I work for it. I\u2019m, literally, every day dedicating a day to a different body part.\u201d\n\nMai says her advice for other people struggling with a similar situation is to look internally.\n\n\u201cYou know yourself if you are at an unhealthy weight, only you would know this. So if you\u2019re that person, what would your body be shaped like if it was the strongest version of you?\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can apply that to a health plan to get it into that shapely, strong indestructible form of you, I think it would look different than the controlled skinny version you\u2019re trying to be.\u201d\n\nHarteis recently announced he is expecting his first child with his girlfriend Linsey Toole.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/alexandra-medina.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bridget-malcolm.jpg",
