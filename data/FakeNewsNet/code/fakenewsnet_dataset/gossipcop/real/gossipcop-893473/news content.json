Cheek stain doubles as lip pigment, and brown eyeshadow helps fill in our brows. But, there's one tube in our makeup bags that could do so much more: concealer.\n\nWhat we normally slather onto zits and undereye circles has many other applications. We tapped makeup artist Tina Turnbow to show us five techniques that turn our old cover-up into a highlighter, brow accent, lip definer, and more.\n\nAhead, find her step-by-step instructions for using concealer to get a gorgeous face. Don't you just love a good multitasker?\n\nHello, Highlighter\n\nIf you haven't plunked down the cash for a contour kit with a shadow powder and highlighter, your concealer could sub in a pinch. \"Make sure you're using one that's about two shades lighter than your skin tone,\" Turnbow says.\n\nImage zoom\n\nStart with your contour powder. Find your cheekbones, and slide the pigment just below them in a downward motion. \"It should end a couple of inches away from the corner of your mouth,\" Turnbow says.\n\nProduct used: Kevyn Aucoin The Sculpting Powder ($44; sephora.com)\n\nImage zoom\n\nNext, apply your concealer. \"It should create a halo effect around your eyes,\" Turnbow says. Use your fingers to pat it on along the tops of your cheekbones. Then, bring it up until it reaches just above the tip of your eyebrows. \"Look for a concealer with a radiant aspect to it,\" she says. \"This will help attract the light.\"\n\nProduct used: NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, ($29; nars.com)\n\nImage zoom\n\nFor your nose contour, use the same shadow you swept under your cheekbones. Focus it along the two edges of the bone. \"Start right under the ends of your brows, and bring it down to the tips,\" Turnbow says.\n\nImage zoom\n\nYour concealer should sit in the center of your nose. Swipe it in a downward motion, to the tip. Then, blend your three lines together. \"When you blend, make sure you're still able to see the product,\" Turnbow says. \"People tend to over-blend and erase the work they just did. Instead, just blur the edges so that they're less noticeable, but still there.\"\n\nImage zoom\n\nThe result is bright, beautiful, and so easy to do. It's contouring that works in real life-not the crazy sculpting you see on the red carpet all the time.
