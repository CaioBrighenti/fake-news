I cannot continue to work with you unless you trust me.\u201d He said, \u201cI need you to take your clothes off. I need you to do this monologue naked.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWhy would my character need to be naked? She is a lawyer in a courtroom.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cBecause I need to see how your body moves. How comfortable you are with your body. This is where I start training you.\u201d\n\nI told him I was uncomfortable. But he continued to coax me\u2014saying that this was in no way a come-on. This was part of training. He wanted to make me a good actress. He wanted to make me comfortable. I thought, \u201cWell, my representation sent me to see him. He must be really important.\u201d I took off my sweater. I was so private about my body. I do remember looking down at the script and seeing my bare chest and not being able to focus on anything but the words and my face being so hot and puffy and feeling so ashamed.\n\nHe commented on my body\u2014said that it was Eastern European. I was just trying to block it all out.\n\nHe said, \u201cWow, you need a lot of work.\u201d\n\nI put my sweater back on. And he proceeded to tell me how much help I needed . . . that I was really just a mess. As I was telling him, \u201cGuess I better get out of here . . .\u201d he sat down on the bed and said, \u201cNo, you have to talk to me.\u201d He started to rub his penis through his pants and asked, \u2018Would you f**k me?\u2019\u201d\n\nI managed to say, \u201cNo. No, I won\u2019t. Are you married? Do you have a wife?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but yes. She\u2019s wonderful. She\u2019s a writer. She\u2019s a teacher. And she\u2019s a wonderful woman. And I have a girlfriend who can\u2019t get enough sex. But I love that. I have to come six or seven times a day or else it really doesn\u2019t work for me to get through my day.\u201d\n\nI felt trapped. I did not know how to get out and save face and not make a scene. Was I imagining it? He dropped some names [of actresses] that he did some really dark sexual things with. These felt like lies and dark gossip and that he would add my name to the list. I went to leave and he got up and blocked the door. He said, \u201cYou have to do this for me. You cannot leave until I have release.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWhat do I have to do? I cannot touch you. I cannot have sex with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s O.K. I can come in my pants. I have to rub up against your leg. You have to pinch my nipples. And you have to look into my eyes.\u2019\u201d I thought, \u201cWell, if I can get out of here without being raped . . .\u201d\n\nHe walked me back to the bed. He sat me down. He got on his knees. And he continued to press so hard against my leg. He was greasy and I had to look into those big brown eyes. I tried to look away, but he would hold my face. So I was forced to look into his eyes. And I felt disgust and shame, and like nobody would ever think of me as being clean again after being this close to the devil. His energy was so sinister.\n\nAfter he finished, he told me, \u201cThere is a girl who went against me. She was going to talk about something I did. I am going to tell you, and this is a promise, if she ever tells anybody, no matter how much time she thinks went by, I have people who will pull up in a car, kidnap her, and throw her in the Hudson River with cement blocks on her feet. You understand what I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f21a0320586235aaecf906/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Embed-Rachel-McAdams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f2219fa923ff0fd178caa2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-selma-blair-rachel-mcadams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d03acff76711f312e7fe6b3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Jeffrey-Katzenberg%25E2%2580%2599s-Quibi.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dec8d5034e986d4cd31532/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/All-the-women-who-have-accused-Harvey-Weinstein.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d03a3b276711f0f057fe6b1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/euphoria-review-hbo.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59ef7eb6556f5850638b4765/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/James-Toback-Sexual-Assault-Accusations.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f21d3b8f85857e9bf60831/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/l-Selma-Blair-Interview.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d090a5cb1f2b435810cf7d4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Harvey-Weinstein-legal-team.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d0263d9ef4f5d344a3a40b2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-lead-jon-stewart.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f2219fa923ff0fd178caa2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-selma-blair-rachel-mcadams.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Yohana Desta", "Hillary Busis", "Sonia Saraiya", "Laura Bradley", "Krista Smith With Julie Mille", "Nicole Sperling"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/selma-blair-and-rachel-mcadams-share-their-stories-of-james-toback-sexual-harassment", "title": "Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams Share Their Stories of James Toback\u2019s Sexual Harassment", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Both women encountered the director early in their careers.
