Demi responded to the question with a laugh and then said, \u201cyou know, something that I always keep to myself is who I write my songs about.\u201d\n\nQuestions from fans about the song\u2019s subject date back earlier this year. Initially, with only the track\u2019s title to go on, fans wondered whether the track could be about one of the Jonas Brothers or Selena Gomez. Only recently did we seem to get more in the way of answers. Following an interview with Demi, Noisey pointed out that the track contains a reference to cigar smoking, a habit notably loved by Nick.\n\nDemi also shared in her interview with Noisey that the track was inspired by frustration with a certain situation.\n\n\"And I was like, 'You know what, I'm just going to write about it.' And so I did, and sent [the songs] to that person, and that was... interesting,\" she continued. \"Any time you send a song about the person, to the person, it's ballsy. It's like, 'Hey! Here's my feelings for you!' \u2026 They knew [about my feelings], but neither of us had acknowledged [them] before. And then it turned out that person had written a song about me, and we exchanged songs.\u201d\n\nFans may never know the true meaning behind the song, but with Demi\u2019s upcoming YouTube documentary* Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated* set to debut on October 17, maybe we\u2019ll get another clue.
