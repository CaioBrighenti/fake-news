And another famous Louis, Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, couldn\u2019t resist sending a friendly tweet to the little prince to let him know that he\u2019s ready to take him \u201cunder my wing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung Louis welcome to the world,\u201d British-born Tomlinson, who is a dad himself to 2-year-old son Freddie, wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll take you under my wing lad. The Adidas tracksuit is in the post!\u201d\n\nYoung Louis welcome to the world. I\u2019ll take you under my wing lad. The Adidas tracksuit is in the post! \u2014 Louis Tomlinson (@Louis_Tomlinson) April 27, 2018\n\nWhile Louis isn\u2019t the most common first name in the British royal family, it has made several appearances over the years as a middle name: It\u2019s one of William\u2019s middle names, as well as one of Louis\u2019s big brother Prince George\u2019s. Louis is also one of Prince Edward\u2019s middle names.\n\nImage zoom Louis Tomlinson\n\nWatch the full episode of Raising a Royal streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nWatch the full episode of Raising a Royal streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nThe feminine version of Louis, Louise, is also a go-to for the family: William\u2019s cousin and the daughter of Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, is named Louise, and it\u2019s one of Princess Anne\u2019s middle names, too.\n\nImage zoom Papixs/Abaca/Sipa/AP\n\nLouis, which means \u201crenowned warrior\u201d in French, is likely a tribute to Prince Philip, whose grandfather was Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg. Louis is also part of Prince William\u2019s full name of William Arthur Philip Louis and Prince George\u2019s full name of George Alexander Louis. The name holds great meaning to William\u2019s own father, Prince Charles, whose beloved great-uncle and mentor, Earl Louis Mountbatten, was assassinated by the IRA in 1979.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Prince William and Kate Middleton Begin Life as a Family of 5: \u2018It Completes Them\u2019\n\nAfter the royal baby\u2019s birth, Charles released a humorous statement on behalf of himself and wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.\n\n\u201cWe are both so pleased at the news,\u201d Charles said in a statement. \u201cIt is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don\u2019t know how I am going to keep up with them.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-631934206.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630",
