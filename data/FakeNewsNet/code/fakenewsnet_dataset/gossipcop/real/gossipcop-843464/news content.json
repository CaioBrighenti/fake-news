But how well do you know her?\n\n1. She started modelling to become an actress\u2026 and still wants to act.\n\n\u201cIn Portugal, my modelling agency represents actors as well. My goal was getting into acting but I start modelling and it started working out just fine\u2026 I\u2019ve actually started acting classes and doing some auditions so we\u2019ll see. It\u2019s what I wanted to do, so this year I\u2019m going for it.\u201d\n\n2. She climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in six days.\n\n\u201cWe were meant to do it in seven but by the last day we were done being there and went all the way down in the same day because we just wanted to go to a hotel. But it was an incredible experience but definitely the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It was physically and mentally so challenging \u2026 You can only stay up [at the summit] for 20 minutes because of the altitude and then you have to start coming down. Believe it or not coming down is as hard as going up and we decided to go down all in one day so on that day we did 17 hours of hiking and by the end I thought I would need surgery on my knees\u2026 but everything was fine.\u201d\n\n3. Her New Year\u2019s resolution is less social media, more time off\n\n\u201cThis year I really want to enjoy my life. Especially on social media you get very caught up on what people say about you and what people think you should be doing. This year I want to let that go and focus on what I want for my life and what I want for my career and really appreciate the things that I have accomplished and start doing those things that I\u2019ve always wanted to do. I want to be more proactive, that\u2019s my goal\u2026 I said want I to be an actress, so I started classes and going to auditions to start the whole process. There are things I want to do and places I want to go. Modelling gave me the travel bug\u2026 Maybe next New Year's I\u2019ll come to Australia for three weeks to explore. I want to do stuff instead of saying I want to.\u201d\n\n4. She lived in Paris before New York.\n\n\u201cI lived in Paris for about nine months. It was an experience. I love Paris but it\u2019s not a city I would like to live in. It\u2019s one of my favorite cities but just in small doses.\u201d\n\n5. She has a longhaired Chihuahua named Luigi, who she has had since Paris.\n\n\u201cHe is the love of my life. He\u2019s like my companion. He usually stays with friends when I travel. Right now he\u2019s at a doggy hotel. I don\u2019t really like him staying at doggy hotels but my friends have not been back to New York yet so he had to go to one.\u201d\n\n6. She is multilingual.\n\n\u201cI can speak English, Portuguese and a bit of Spanish, or Sportugal. It\u2019s a mix of Portuguese and Spanish. I understand French and Italian but I can\u2019t speak them.\u201d\n\n7. She is a Gossip Girl fan\n\nDo you think you are more Blair or Serena? \u201cBlair.\u201d\n\n8. She binge-watches The Royals\n\n\u201cThis is going to be bad. I\u2019ve been very obsessed with The Royals. It\u2019s not going to win any Oscars or Golden Globes or whatever but I really, really enjoy it. I just binged watched the season two.\u201d\n\n9. She is a homebody but not a homemaker\n\n\u201cIf I go to a club, five minutes later I just want to go home so I haven\u2019t really gone out much because I don\u2019t really enjoy it. I\u2019d rather do stupid stuff with my friends at home\u2026 I can\u2019t decorate. I\u2019m very bad at it. I like staying at home but I don\u2019t know how to make a home a home.\u201d\n\n10. She was star struck by Taylor Swift\n\n\u201cI remember the first time I met the second time. I probably still am. I try to act normal but I can\u2019t.\u201d", "images": ["https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/billie_cover1_web-3.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red.svg", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a08a8064a8de23a7a38411a6a58c7281", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/937219620a5a4dd49f05c030a9d38e60", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/nav-close.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2953d27c2f54cc587cfdd5c73c34928d", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5c23defc0c7bb84767c0485f80409b5d", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/vogue-au-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/af5c9f2e5bb7c1610b5db1d50597cd46", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red-mobile.svg", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/6fe084e060c019904ba3c09e5cd9555d", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/google-play.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80bf4d4f4840daab4f18df57aa7ee0a5", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/app-store.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/1c859392cf1ae3ea4390f982c537a833", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1147426885.jpg", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/0413e1da0f8021366dea4988695e6ef0", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f7aef56bf5aa3e4d4f8138e45413757c", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5e1a8165c54af1fe71c251dbf4f9bbe9", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ab65a9ab055400f7b5ffa32b65536b69", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/1ef51ff42f7222f741806ff956e198de", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/096021cce884c09e3e2918767d9ce3f9", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/94446a74517eaab7936ab2ad1e83051c", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f94f24e9787758420dd759b63f10d193"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f94f24e9787758420dd759b63f10d193", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com.au/fashion/news/10-things-you-never-knew-about-victorias-secret-angel-sara-sampaio/news-story/63187e5c9da183fe150da8a1f4c2475f", "title": "10 things you never knew about Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel Sara Sampaio", "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "Vogue Australia", "type": "article", "title": "10 things you never knew about Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel Sara Sampaio", "description": "Millions of people follow 24-year-old Portuguese model Sara Sampaio.
