The ladies gave \u201cDown\u201d its television debut when they performed during Good Morning America\u2018s summer concert series Friday, where they were joined by the rapper.\n\nUnfortunately Kordei took the song title a bit too literally, falling to the stage mid-Gucci rap. (See it at 2:15 in the video above.) \u201cLeave it to Normani to eat the stage,\u201d she joked after the performance. \u201cHella went down! I\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\nLEAVE IT TO NORMANI TO EAT THE STAGE PERFORMING ON @GMA THE FIRST LOOK FOR OUR NEW SINGLE. HELLA WENT DOWNN \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude4a IM DEADDDDD AAKZJZKA lmao \u2014 Normani (@NormaniKordei) June 2, 2017\n\nFROM COINAGE: What Is The Grammy Bounce?

We\u2019re not even the same people we were two months ago,\u201d Kordei, 21, told PEOPLE about the four-part harmony in May.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear our growth and maturity reflected in the music we\u2019re creating. We\u2019ve been working really hard,\u201d the season 24 Dancing with the Stars finalist added. \u201cAnd this is the first time personally that I\u2019ve vibed out and turned on Fifth Harmony on my own because I love the songs so much. We\u2019ve literally been vibing out to our own album.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/camila-cabello-2.jpg",
