According to court documents obtained by Us, the actress, 48, has filed a petition to establish custody and child support. Heche is seeking joint custody and \u201creasonable visitation\u201d rights for both parents and is also asking that Tupper, 52, pay her legal fees during the court battle.\n\nThe former couple first met when they costarred in the ABC series Men in Trees in 2006, while she was married to ex-husband Coleman Laffoon. Heche then ended her marriage to the cameraman, and she began dating the Big Little Lies actor shortly after. The couple moved in together in 2007 and Heche\u2019s rep confirmed that The Brave actress was expecting a child with Tupper in December 2008. During their relationship, the duo worked together on different projects, including the Syfy network\u2019s show Aftermath and NBC\u2019s The Brave.\n\nAlthough they were together for more than a decade, the pair never married. In a 2011 interview with The Telegraph, Heche described herself as \u201ceternally engaged\u201d to Tupper, and said that she was in no rush to make things official. \u201cI\u2019ve already said yes. When I\u2019m 60 I\u2019m happy to walk down the aisle,\u201d she said, also revealing that he bought her a new ring every year they didn\u2019t tie the knot.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s given me a ring every year so I don\u2019t want to stop that. I have quite a collection,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve been married before and so has he. I don\u2019t know what either of us would gain or what would change that would benefit us.\u201d\n\nHeche also shares son Homer, 15, with her ex-husband. Prior to that marriage, the actress was in a high profile relationship with Ellen DeGeneres from 1997 until their split in 2000. Tupper was married to Kate Mayfield, but they divorced in 2006.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
