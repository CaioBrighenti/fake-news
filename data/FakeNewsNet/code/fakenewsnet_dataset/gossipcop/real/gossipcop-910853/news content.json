She also said she \u201csees things\u201d when asked about the spies Weinstein allegedly sent to quiet her.\n\nIn the strange interview spanning the Bible, George W. Bush, and khakis, McGowan, wearing an orange hoodie, also addressed her recent arrest on drug charges, saying, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve had handcuffs on me, but no one else in this situation. Isn\u2019t that grand?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we can do better, societally,\u201d she added during another segment of the interview. \u201cI think we can be looser, 10%, have more fun, be better, see more colors, run, and what are we doing? It\u2019s not working out so well here. Am I wrong? There\u2019s a bus on fire with a madman and a blindfold, and everyone\u2019s still talking about it as if it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s not nice. It\u2019s f\u2014ing weird, right? Whoa. Shake it up because otherwise we\u2019re all maybe gonna die sooner than we think.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, McGowan defended herself on Twitter from those criticizing the interview, tweeting \u201cI just have a different personality than you. I don\u2019t follow protocol. And I will talk about WHAT I WANT. I requested a Dick Cavett free form hangout.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am unusual, that IS the point. I do not care for formats or traditional thought. Every interview of mine is different, just like a mood. A lot of you are meeting me for the first time. Don\u2019t compare me to what you would do or be. Be free,\u201d she said in another tweet.\n\n2) I am bored of formats and questions. I am done with traditional structure. If you\u2019re not with the fake tradition of traditional promotional \u201cappearances\u201d then by all means, stay in your square, but DO NOT APPLY TO ME . @TheAVClub \u2014 rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) February 1, 2018\n\nI am unusual, that IS the point.

After a woman in the audience criticized her for not doing enough for transgender women, she responded, \u201cSo f\u2014ing shut up. Please systemically. For once. In the world. You know what I\u2019m talking about. Just tell the God damned truth. Stop boxing everybody into s\u2014. I didn\u2019t agree to your cis f\u2014ing world. Ok?
