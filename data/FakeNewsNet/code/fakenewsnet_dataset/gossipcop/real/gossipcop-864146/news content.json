Hilton was arrested on May 6 after allegedly stealing a car belonging to the father of his ex.\n\nHilton was picked up by police shortly before 5 a.m. in early May at a home in the Hollywood Hills, according to the Associated Press. The 23-year-old was snagged in a Bentley owned by his ex-girlfriend\u2019s father.\n\nRELATED: Paris Hilton Talks Growing Up With Ivanka Trump\n\nOn Thursday, Hilton appeared at his arraignment in court which was originally postponed due to the hotel heir\u2019s bizarre behaviour. Hilton\u2019s attorney, the famed Robert Shapiro, spoke on his behalf, telling the judge his client had undergone treatment at a psychiatric clinic, per court order after several outbursts in a Los Angeles court.\n\nLast month, Hilton\u2019s hearing was delayed after he showed up in court in a jail smock meant to prevent self-harm and made several bizarre outbursts including mouthing the words \u201cf*** you\u201d and \u201cI hate you\u201d to his parents, Rick and Kathy Hilton and his brother Barron.\n\nThe judge ordered Hilton released on $600,000 bail and required him to be treated at a psychiatric clinic until today\u2019s court date. He appeared calm in court next to Shapiro, wearing a navy suit and velvet shoes, according to E! News. The judge scheduled Hilton\u2019s next hearing for August.\n\nRELATED: Paris Hilton Changes Science Forever In April Fools\u2019 Day Prank\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Hilton has been in trouble with the law.\n\nJust two years ago, Hilton was arrested two years ago inside his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home.\n\nHe also received probation for threatening British Airways flight attendants and spent two months in jail last year for violating that probation by using cocaine and other drugs.", "images": ["https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10332590b_huge.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_9307069en_huge.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C3222px%2C2153px&resize=145%2C97", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/33884b32ba91d0d15b7e3c806c45d26e.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=628&h=480&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/gettyimages-1138920604.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C254px%2C2466px%2C1650px&resize=145%2C97", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/383/787/ETC071219RKellyMoreChargesJacobHoggardPreliminaryHearingDay2ONLINES.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/558/587/GLOB0055739960000011_1_thumbnail_711x400_1570397251897.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/384/763/ETC071219SethRogenBillyEichnerTheLionKingONLINE.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10333493g_huge.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/384/263/ETC071219SwordOfTrustCast2019SXSWONLINES.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/c03-chris-crippin-in-studio.png?w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/et.png?w=90", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10216925bv_huge.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://media.globaltv.com/videostatic/417/471/ETC171219EDSHEERANNEWMUSIConlines.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/et.png?w=82", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_9970434y_huge-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/20577679.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C49px%2C2476px%2C1657px&resize=145%2C97", "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-803399844.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://shawetcanada.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-803399844.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shakiel Mahjouri"], "canonical_link": "http://etcanada.com/news/223691/conrad-hilton-pleads-not-guilty-to-disobeying-restraining-order-after-undergoing-psychiatric-treatment/", "title": "Conrad Hilton Pleads Not Guilty To Disobeying Restraining Order After Undergoing Psychiatric Treatment", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Conrad Hilton Pleads Not Guilty To Disobeying Restraining Order After Undergoing Psychiatric\u00a0Treatment", "author": "Shakiel Mahjouri", "description": "Paris Hilton's little brother, Conrad Hilton, pleaded guilty on Thursday after violating an ex-girlfriend's restraining order.
