I just feel like I\u2019m trickling down a little bit with the relationship, I\u2019m slowly going down as he treats me like s\u2014.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI\u2019m just kind of feeling my way through this right now, in any way that I can. It\u2019s nothing but stress.\u201d\n\nWhen a friend who was with her asked if Portwood was afraid to be alone, the reality star said, \u201cI\u2019m scared that I developed this relationship with this guy that I loved and am I making a mistake if I let him go?\u201d\n\nReturning to the home she shares with Baier, he tried to make amends with Portwood after the various arguments they had in season 6 including the rift between them that began when Baier, a recovering addict, offered Catelynn Lowell Baltiera a Xanax during the previous season.\n\nImage zoom Amber Portwood and Matt Baier Matt Baier/Instagram\n\n\u201cThe first two years of our relationship we were really, really good at not letting people get to us,\u201d Baier said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s been dealing with this s\u2014 for three years \u2014 since the beginning with all the lies,\u201d Portwood said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand I am going to have trust issues.\u201d\n\nBaier responded with, \u201cMe too,\u201d which caught Portwood by surprise as she asked, \u201cDid you say, \u2018Me too?'\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the same way,\u201d he quickly said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you f\u2014ing high right now?\u201d Portwood asked him.\n\nBaier jokingly said, \u201cI wish. I do.\u201d\n\nPortwood didn\u2019t appreciate his sense of humor, saying, \u201cExcuse me? Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would you ask me if I\u2019m high? Yeah I did drugs,\u201d he said, turning to directly face MTV cameras. \u201cAnd yeah, if you want me to say it on camera, I relapsed the year and I\u2019m not ashamed of it.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWhy did I relapse? Because of all this bulls\u2014. You can only take so much of this s\u2014 and I relapsed pretty f\u2014ing hard. I was going through a really tough time.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amber Portwood\u2019s Ex-Fianc\u00e9 Matt Baier Says He Wants Her \u2018to Be Happy and Safe\u2019 as She Is Seen Kissing a New Man\n\nBaier suggested he and Portwood \u201cgo back to our life, get back to counseling and f\u2014 the world.\u201d\n\nPortwood had a different suggestion in mind.\n\n\u201c[Let\u2019s] go slow right now, I think the wedding needs to be \u2026 completely \u2026 done right now,\u201d she said. \u201c[I\u2019m] not even thinking about the wedding or anything, or being engaged.\u201d\n\nBaier, shocked, asked, \u201cAnd what?\u201d\n\nThe other moms on the show also faced their own life changing moments, with Farrah Abraham\u2019s mother, Debra, trying to be a mediator in the tenuous relationship between her fianc\u00e9, David, and her daughter.
