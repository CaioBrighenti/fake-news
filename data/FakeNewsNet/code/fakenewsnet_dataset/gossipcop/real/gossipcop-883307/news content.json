I shopped for weeks and this really is the best bed for the best price. The headboard is about shoulder height (I\u0092m 5\u00923\u0094) and the way I rigged it, the mattress does look like it\u0092s sitting on a platform, so plenty of it shows. Overall I'm happy but this was a hell of an experience which I have tediously documented here: The delivery was fast. I came home like 4 days after I ordered it and there were two massive boxes on my porch. One was almost the size of a twin bed (headboard, not heavy), the other was seriously like 8 feet long and two feet wide and pretty heavy (side rails, slats, foot board) and I had to drag it inside. I'm a petite woman but extremely stubborn -- I refuse to be bossed around by assemble-yourself furniture. At 8 pm, I tore into the boxes. Each box has separate instructions. The instructions are mostly useless for anything but a good laugh. The Chinese -to- English translation is pretty confusing, especially regarding quantities of parts (planks: 1. Slat: 13). And there were real head scratchers like, \"resistant to scratches but not scratch resistant.\" So I put the headboard together fine (I thought), and then the footboard and the siderails attached together once I used logic and wadded up the instructions and threw them across the room (the arrows made it look like the hooks on the side boards attach to the bolts on the footboard somehow, but they really just slide down the crack between the leg part and the foot part and hook onto something inside). Then it was time for the slats. They are supposed to be strung together with two black fabric strips but several of mine had come off the fabric strips, and got tangled. They are made of the sh1ttiest wood, and scratched up my arms and even gave me splinters. I couldn\u0092t figure out how the one plank was supposed to attach to the slats, where it was supposed to be attached to the frame, what all the screws were for, and how on earth the telescoping plastic legs were supposed to support this one plank. Also, the slats, when pulled over the frame, seemed to be the wrong size. They fit at the foot, but not at the head of the frame?? I had remembered that one reviewer said he just put his box spring on the ground and didn't use the slats at all, so in frustration I threw the slats in the dumpster and I tried this too. When I went to put the box spring in, I realized the frame was shaped like a triangle: skinnier at the top. I finally realized that I had screwed the rectangular head frame support pieces on the wrong sides of the headboard. It took 30 minutes to fix this, as the screws are very long and the allan wrench is very annoying. The box spring fit inside the frame on the floor, but when I put my mattress on top, it got stuck on the side rails, making my bed a soft taco. So I went back out to the dumpster and muscled the slats out and whimpered as I carried them back to my bedroom with nearly bloody arms. I then put the slats on top of the box spring. But there was a 5\u0094 gap between them because I didn\u0092t use the plank. So I went to my book shelves and found all of my literature anthologies from college (I knew I was hanging onto them for a reason!!). Most of them were exactly the right thickness. I placed them under the slats, in a row down the middle, where I guess that damn plank should have gone. Satisfied with my McGyvering genius, I then slid the mattress over my rigged contraption. I suggest you do not slide anything over the delicate pleather as mine now has many small gouges and black scuffs from my retardo struggles. Finally, I made my bed and was pleased and relieved. I cleaned up the massive packing mess\u0097styrofoam, plastic, and silica gel beads everywhere -- and broke down the boxes and vacuumed, which took another hour. Then I took some photos to brag to my coworkers. At about 1:30 a.m. I finally went to sleep. In the morning, from the vantage point of my toilet, I saw my hideous box spring peaking out under my side rail. I might have to use that f*&%ing plank after all.", "images": ["https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/13776122/P20428865.jpg?impolicy=medium&imwidth=200", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-782f2ef1-df12-4ce6-8fa8-9c3bda6e61c7_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/9598443/P16784053.jpg?impolicy=medium&imwidth=200", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-3e63f447-14f7-4c7e-99e0-038e84a7a12a_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/20603123/P16557335.jpg?impolicy=medium&imwidth=200", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/is/images/direct/2ab2e443ecf98d59fe2e1e2cdf324675220d9dc2/Sophie_Tufted_Upholstered_Platform_Bed_by_iNSPIRE_Q_Classic.jpeg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-b8ef7a23-25b4-470b-94df-6a0b57715340_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/19511636/P25504541.jpg?impolicy=medium&imwidth=200", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/P13915497.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-26b8e53a-d248-4513-86e2-0829e0b169d5_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/17783850/P23980368.jpg?impolicy=medium&imwidth=200", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-721e98e8-beb6-4813-a477-aaa6e5899844_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-e523c446-8c99-4808-9441-8799d9d74079_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-a958a702-b98f-4c9f-9b7b-1136776baf80_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/13777960/P20430446.jpg?impolicy=medium&imwidth=200", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/img/mxc/intFlag_US.gif", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-0a0ea0f6-b80e-46ad-beb9-8d4db6941943_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-c7e0bcd4-2bfb-445a-a18c-cf67765cadec_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/is/images/direct/9fc3e458d5cf979fa6325e42e41dd5d979a438bb/Sophie_Tufted_Upholstered_Platform_Bed_by_iNSPIRE_Q_Classic.jpeg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-8147bec5-cdc4-4a8d-b4c4-8ec4e2239afa_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/is/images/direct/3bfcece62300f30f150035689396da1e3501707c/Sophie_Tufted_Upholstered_Platform_Bed_by_iNSPIRE_Q_Classic.jpeg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-97a00df2-6bbc-438f-8a99-9d261cf8ad32_80.jpg", "https://www.overstock.com/dlp?cci=NG6M5ZBKIKN2FTCOOB64KUMD5Q", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-becf36cf-8ceb-4262-823b-2cef4a9830a3_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/9477532/P16659692.jpg?impolicy=medium&imwidth=200", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/is/images/direct/09e63bdcf2b43de599d807c6444053b92ee71e1a/Sophie_Tufted_Upholstered_Platform_Bed_by_iNSPIRE_Q_Classic.jpeg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-b66a1564-179d-493b-88b3-b7e0a5316fd1_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-70ebccd4-cf10-4254-b3e8-9d7f8d923b96_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-782f2ef1-df12-4ce6-8fa8-9c3bda6e61c7_600.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/10170659/P17298690.jpg?impolicy=medium&imwidth=200", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic-6f4bc4ab-73fa-4e96-b292-26458ee626bc_80.jpg", "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/is/images/direct/5c86186bc034bc53a302407ba824b0c35c082aef/Sophie_Tufted_Upholstered_Platform_Bed_by_iNSPIRE_Q_Classic.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://ak1.ostkcdn.com/images/products/6281640/P13915497.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Overstock"], "canonical_link": "https://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Sophie-Tufted-Upholstered-Platform-Bed-by-iNSPIRE-Q-Classic/6281640/product.html", "title": "Shop Sophie Tufted Upholstered Platform Bed by iNSPIRE Q Classic", "meta_data": {"description": "Shop for Sophie Tufted Upholstered Platform Bed by iNSPIRE Q Classic.
