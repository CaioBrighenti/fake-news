{"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/bootcut-jeans-revival-classic-denim-trends", "text": "A cursory glance at the Spring \u201916 collections reveals that fashion is in the midst of a major shift. The minimalism that ruled the runways (and our wardrobes) for the better part of five years has been replaced by a cobbled-together, anything-goes sensibility; now more than ever, women are being encouraged to mix, match, and wear only what they love. To many of us, Gucci\u2019s glittering knits and Vetements\u2019s tablecloth boots are an invitation to get creative\u2014but to the uninitiated, it could all simply read as tacky. The concept of \u201cgood\u201d vs. \u201cbad\u201d taste has been of recent debate here in the Vogue offices\u2014how do you determine what\u2019s chic and what isn\u2019t? Or is some degree of tackiness the secret to inspired style?\n\nThe continued \u201990s revival indicates the answer is yes\u2014and that counts for denim, too. Super-wide \u201970s flares and faded Levi\u2019s 501s are great, but those looking to make a quieter, less literal statement may want to consider the oft-forgotten boot-cut jean. More curve-hugging than a flare but longer and leaner than a straight-leg, it nails the tricky middle ground between familiar and au courant. \u201cThe boot-cut is back!\u201d says Kelly Connor, Vogue.com\u2019s resident denim expert. \u201cThey\u2019re flattering, lengthening, and perfect for those who aren\u2019t so into the full, high-rise flares we\u2019ve been seeing everywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\nJane Birkin Photo: Getty Images\n\nWhile images of denim icons like Fran\u00e7oise Hardy and Jane Birkin instantly spring to mind, Connor\u2019s personal boot-cut muses might surprise you. \u201cI love the boot-cut jeans of the early \u201900s\u2014Britney Spears, Halle Berry, and all those glossy blondes from The Hills and Laguna Beach,\u201d she says. \u201cIn retrospect, Kristin Cavallari was quite chic and ahead of her time!\u201d\n\nPerhaps boot-cut jeans are refreshing because they are considered a tad tacky. Or maybe it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t worn them in a while; chances are you\u2019ve got a pair tucked away in the back of your closet. Either way, there\u2019s no denying the thigh-slimming, rear-lifting powers of a fitted, dark-rinse, mid- or high-rise jean that kicks out just below the knee. The sharp, sleek silhouette will quickly upgrade the chunky sweaters, lace blouses, and anything else you\u2019re buying this fall\u2014not to mention the obvious choice: a great pair of boots.", "images": ["http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/02/denim-article-banner.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5891c94a8c64075803ad28eb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/embed-bootcut-jeans.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d0817bf4593fd31ec139815/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/Heidi%2520Schreck%2520promo.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d026468ef56f801ad9a34ca/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/BGUS_1622210_015%2520(1).jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d13d6b33ef3b50008fb4e92/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/00-vw-city-totes-beach-bags.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d013782ad2de30ddf2f2b8a/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/00-vw-summer-lingerie.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d01495a52bf062194bfe5cf/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/01-wildest-dreams-vogue-july-issue-2019.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.e59a2fba3f338152fef5e68bdd8de503b13ab406.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5891c94cb4a4bd4660129917/master/w_1280%2Cc_limit/holding-boot-cut-jeans.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d1b9cf980c51b0009cfbe58/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/00-vw-anklets%2520copy.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d0a48e9c029068e5047b412/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/01-thong.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d14f35c942e8700082f3c64/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/00-story-best-one-piece-tops.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.e33072deca0cf93bb836ebae5f1a13228ccd143f.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d139a6dd2420d00088be87b/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/00-story-menss20-trends.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b2a8c0b7357fe57e6f17145/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/00-story-flipflops.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5891c94cb4a4bd4660129917/master/w_1280,c_limit/holding-boot-cut-jeans.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5891c94cb4a4bd4660129917/master/w_1280,c_limit/holding-boot-cut-jeans.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christian Allaire", "Janelle Okwodu", "Liana Satenstein", "Emily Farr", "Emily Farra", "Anny Choi", "Madeline Fass", "Sophie Kemp"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/bootcut-jeans-revival-classic-denim-trends", "title": "The Boot-Cut Is Back!
