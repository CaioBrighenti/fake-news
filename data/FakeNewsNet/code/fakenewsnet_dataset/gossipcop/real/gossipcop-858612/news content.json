(April 11) AP\n\nJustina Machado, lower left, stars in Netflix's 'One Day at a Time,' with, clockwise, Isabella Gomez, Rita Moreno and Marcel Ruiz. The 1970s reboot is still breaking new ground,dealing with PTSD, pay inequality and LGBTQ issues. (Photo: Adam Rose/Netflix)\n\nAnother day, another TV reboot.\n\nOur television screens are filled with revivals and remakes these days, including Roseanne, which returned on ABC with blockbuster ratings, the GIF-able Fab Five of Queer Eye on Netflix and the latest, Netflix's Lost in Space, a big-budget reboot of the 1960s sci-fi adventure.\n\nWith so many classic TV shows coming back, it can be hard to keep track. We've definitively ranked 11 of the biggest, from the highs of One Day at a Time to the lows of Fuller House.\n\n1. One Day at a Time (Netflix)\n\nNetflix's new take on Norman Lear's 1970s CBS sitcom is the model all others should follow. Fresh but also familiar, with sublime casting and a perfect blend of comedy and tragedy, One Day manages to feel as relevant in 2018 as it did in 1975. Renewed.\n\n2. Twin Peaks (Showtime)\n\nFBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) is back in Showtime's revival of the David Lynch-Mark Frost classic \"Twin Peaks.\" (Photo: SUZANNE TENNER/SHOWTIME)\n\nDirector David Lynch ran with the revival of the 1990s ABC drama to create something weirder, wilder and ultimately more wonderful than what came before. Not expected to return.\n\n3. Queer Eye (Netflix)\n\nThe Fab Five of the new \"Queer Eye': Bobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness and Tan France. (Photo: Gavin Bond/Netflix)\n\nThe new Fab Five are fabulous, indeed. Bobby Berk (design), Karamo Brown (culture), Antoni Porowski (food and wine), Jonathan Van Ness (grooming) and Tan France (fashion) have revitalized the early 2000s Bravo staple. The new series, set in the Atlanta area, is addictive and moves beyond some of the cartoonish elements of the original series. Renewed.\n\n4. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Netflix)\n\nLorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) contemplate their quirky Connecticut town in Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.' (Photo: Saeed Adyani/Netflix, Saeed Adyani/Netflix)\n\nWhatever you think of the controversial \"final four words\" of the WB series, it was lovely to visit Stars Hollow again and check in with Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) after the original signed off with a dissatisfying finale.\n\n5. Lost in Space (Netflix)\n\nThe Robinsons, from left, John (Toby Stephens), Penny (Mina Sundwall), Judy (Taylor Russell), Will (Maxwell Jenkins) and Maureen (Molly Parker), huddle in the presence of a powerful robot in Netflix's \"Lost in Space.\" (Photo: Netflix)\n\nWill Robinson (Maxwell Jenkins) is still in danger. TV's latest remake is one of its most expensive, a CGI-filled space epic that turns the cheesy 1960s sci-fi series into a tense, twisty action-adventure. Sometimes it's a little too self-serious, but most of the time it's a fun romp. Streaming now.\n\n6. Will & Grace (NBC)\n\nWill (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) have returned and 'Will & Grace' is sparking chatter. (Photo: Chris Haston/NBC)\n\nEric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally slid easily back into their roles as Will, Grace, Jack and Karen on the NBC sitcom. Although it sometimes feels a little dated, their chemistry and timing haven't lost anything since the series went off the air in 2006. Renewed for two more seasons.\n\n7. Dynasty (CW)\n\nElizabeth Gillies as Fallon and James Mackay as Steven on 'Dynasty.' (Photo: Mark Hill, The CW)\n\nSet in Atlanta, the splashy, steamy reboot of ABC's nighttime soap isn't quite as juicy as the original, but it still has plenty of fun family drama and catfights. Renewed; airs Fridays (8 ET/PT).\n\n8. The X-Files (Fox)\n\nMulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) are back investigating cases in Season 11 of \"The X-Files\" on Fox. (Photo: Shane Harvey/Fox)\n\nFox's revival of the 1990s sci-fi hit has been up and down in quality. Its first season was lackluster, but this year the show found some more exciting, simply scary stories to tell, though it's not expected to return.\n\n9. Roseanne (ABC)\n\nRoseanne (Roseanne Barr) and Dan (John Goodman) share a hug on ABC's 'Roseanne.' (Photo: Adam Rose/ABC)\n\nControversial, political and a bona fide hit, Roseanne didn't exactly return quietly. New episodes don't reach the height of the old favorites, but there's something special when the series stops posturing and focuses on the Conner family, especially Darlene (Sara Gilbert), who's the real heart of the new show. Renewed; airs Tuesdays (8 ET/PT).\n\n10. American Idol (ABC)\n\nNew 'American Idol' judges Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Luke Bryan have a diverse group of singers for the rebooted series. (Photo: Eric Liebowitz/ABC)\n\nBrought back just two years after it signed off on Fox, ABC's version of the once-gigantic singing competition is fluffier, hammier and more Disney-fied. Lionel Richie makes a strong effort on the judging panel, Luke Bryan is mostly harmless, but Katy Perry is a distraction. Airs Sundays and Mondays (8 ET/PT).\n\n11. Fuller House (Netflix)\n\nD.J. (Candace Cameron Bure, left), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Kimmy (Andrea Barber) share a moment with the Tanner and Gibbler kids in \"Fuller House.\" (Photo: Michael Yarish/Netflix)\n\nToo corny, too stuck in the '90s, Netflix's return to the Tanner family of ABC's 1987-95 Full House is a valiant effort that has nothing but nostalgia going for it. And that's just not enough. Renewed.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2qDQsht", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2cc5227071738aee56fa3a59100718ea452f7cf/c=0-12-2398-1815/local/-/media/2018/03/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636580176556119229-147831-6302.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-nav-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/40b7c41663d333388c5ebf9548c20e1013adefee/c=250-0-3442-2400/local/-/media/2017/05/17/USATODAY/USATODAY/636305762541886400-Twin-Peaks-MacLachlan.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5005.62.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67d77b70969a0c005d4a65ab900483945262d9b8/c=170-0-2830-2000/local/-/media/2017/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636423172633211835-NUP-179312-3332.JPG?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/034b1e529ad8690522230402c064285fd578b500/c=549-0-4890-3264/local/-/media/2017/07/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636349523171711556-XXX-IMG-031-GILMOREGIRLS-101-3-1-SCH68NKT-88415490.JPG?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5005.62.0/images/indicators/facebook-loading.gif", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f85982cecef20f3cdd3bf5a0abdb22c26a3610c/c=259-0-4242-2250/local/-/media/2018/04/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/636590032938097151-LIS-101-SG-a00021R2.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-masthead-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67d77b70969a0c005d4a65ab900483945262d9b8/c=170-0-2830-2000/local/-/media/2017/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636431670301649344-DYN102a-0350b.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f98250aae668358219cd2d6d5dede15268e2dba5/c=221-0-3679-2600/local/-/media/2017/12/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/636502675511210161-XF-S2-202-Sc-14-SH-0736-hires2.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3335ed16df9b310cd3f8ed957f4998c3e0eeca93/c=1099-0-4092-2250/local/-/media/2018/04/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/636590032938097151-LIS-101-SG-a00021R2.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41598ef25bb01ea9fc27b928126fa10aa1574bfb/c=139-0-2799-2000/local/-/media/2018/04/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636592186273161099-147800-0793.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/033ad49c5d0519610f9ee641ebaaa62d054d8628/c=204-0-3396-2400/local/-/media/2018/01/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636524214042033789-ODAAT-202-Unit-00033R.jpg?width=534&height=401&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/033ad49c5d0519610f9ee641ebaaa62d054d8628/c=204-0-3396-2400/local/-/media/2016/02/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635923611071756473-FH-105-00872r2.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/833a698f3dc80509e05dd735a4c8f4933a7d040b/c=405-0-3194-2097/local/-/media/2018/03/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636567947305053643-QESI-GB-POP-GROUP-3859R.jpg?width=540&height=405&fit=crop"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f85982cecef20f3cdd3bf5a0abdb22c26a3610c/c=259-0-4242-2250/local/-/media/2018/04/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/636590032938097151-LIS-101-SG-a00021R2.jpg?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelly Lawler", "Published A.M.
