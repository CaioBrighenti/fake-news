On this week\u2019s episode, the cast deals with the aftermath of the fight, which of course leads to another \u2014 this time, between Abraham and Kendra Wilkinson Baskett. The Teen Mom OG star makes some racially insensitive comments towards Paula, but it doesn\u2019t sit too well with the former Playboy model, who shares two children with her African-American husband Hank Baskett.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t throw out the f\u2014ing race card like that. This bitch didn\u2019t just offend Paula, she offended my husband and my kids, me,\u201d says Wilkinson Baskett, 32, in a confessional. \u201cYou\u2019re going f\u2014ing down, dude.\u201d\n\nIn a conversation about the finale, the Kendra on Top also says there were more sinister motivations behind the fight.\n\n\u201cFarrah was supposed to have self-control and she voluntarily picked on [Paula] for her own amusement and for her own rating or whatever and I didn\u2019t like it all,\u201d she tells PEOPLE. \u201cYou\u2019re picking on someone who\u2019s highly vulnerable and who\u2019s highly not in self-control. I didn\u2019t like it all. I spoke my mind.\u201d\n\nPrior to the comments made by Abraham, Wilkinson Baskett says she \u201cdidn\u2019t even know Farrah existed,\u201d but now that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the type of person to mind my own business and focus on my own issues, but at that moment I felt really uncomfortable,\u201d she says. \u201cI spoke what I felt was right, and both of them should be held accountable.\u201d\n\nMarriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars \u2014 Family Edition airs Fridays (9 p.m. ET) on WE tv.", "images":
