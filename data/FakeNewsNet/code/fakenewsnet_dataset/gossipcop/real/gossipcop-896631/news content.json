I think you'd have to watch all 96 hours to get the final verdict. That's her thing, man - to go big and bold. Yeah, I checked in with it. It's definitely odd to watch your ex-girlfriend asleep.\"\n\nBut the 'Your Body is a Wonderland' hitmaker has no qualms about admitting to tuning in to the footage, and he has even encouraged people to admit to their actions.\n\nHe added: \"The way I see things now, I call it 'stand in the middle of the boat.' If someone says, 'I don't watch that,' it's like, 'Yes, you do.' You know? Watch when you want to watch it. Be human about it.\"\n\nAnd while John was honestly opening up about his activities, he also revealed he texted the 33-year-old artist to wish her Happy Birthday last month.\n\nHe said: \"It's like, if you want to text someone ... I texted Katy happy birthday. It was four in the morning. It was like a post-midnight, haven't-gone-to-sleep-yet, it's-technically-your-birthday send. Because how weird is it to be like, 'I want to say happy birthday now, but I'm going to wait until tomorrow afternoon?'. Be a person, man.\"\n\nAlthough Katy has hailed John as the greatest lover out of all the men she has been romantically linked to, including ex-husband Russell Brand and Orlando Bloom, the 'Gravity' rocker has not reciprocated the complement, but agrees with the 'Swish Swish' artist.\n\nHe said: \"Right here [pointing to his head]. So far, it's on a little SD card, I've been creating it myself. I've been my best lover so far.\"", "images": ["https://www.thespec.com/Contents/Images/Communities/TheSpec_1200x630.png", "https://www.thespec.com/Contents/Images/news-icon.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thespec.com/Contents/Images/Communities/TheSpec_1200x630.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/7968410-john-mayer-still-keeps-tabs-on-ex-girlfriend-katy-perry/", "title": "John Mayer still keeps tabs on ex-girlfriend Katy Perry", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 374180572246}, "robots": "index, follow", "description": "John Mayer still keeps tabs on his ex-girlfriend Katy Perry and tuned into her four-day live stream and watched her sleep, although it felt", "og": {"title": "John Mayer still keeps tabs on ex-girlfriend Katy Perry", "url": "https://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/7968410-john-mayer-still-keeps-tabs-on-ex-girlfriend-katy-perry/", "description": "John Mayer still keeps tabs on his ex-girlfriend Katy Perry and tuned into her four-day live stream and watched her sleep, although it felt \\", "type": "Article", "site_name": "TheSpec.com", "image": "https://www.thespec.com/Contents/Images/Communities/TheSpec_1200x630.png"}, "article": {"section": "WhatsOn-Celebrity", "published_time": "2017-11-28T12:00:11Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-28T13:34:41Z"}, "parsely-title": "John Mayer still keeps tabs on ex-girlfriend Katy Perry", "parsely-link": "https://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/7968410-john-mayer-still-keeps-tabs-on-ex-girlfriend-katy-perry/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "http://media.zuza.com/e/d/ed7ec06b-3c7b-4f5c-8b8e-118235e11d84/BS2BS1484752_Image1_Thumbnail.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-11-28T12:00:11Z", "parsely-section": "whatson|celebrity", "parsely-tags": "subcategory:whatson|celebrity,category:whatson,news_source:bangshowbiz,primary_publication:bramptonguardian,video:no,images:1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Communities/thespec/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511870411.0, "source": "https://www.thespec.com", "summary": ""}
