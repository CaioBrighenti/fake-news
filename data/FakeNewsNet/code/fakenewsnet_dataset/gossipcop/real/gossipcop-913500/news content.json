The photo spread, labeled \"In Her Own Words,\" also includes models Sailor Brinkley Cook, Paulina Porizkova and Robyn Lawley among others.\n\nRaisman includes such words and phrases as \"trust yourself,\" \"live for you\" and \"abuse is never okay.\"\n\n\"I would like to remind everyone that being a survivor is nothing to be ashamed of, and going through a hard time does not define you,\" Raisman told the magazine. \"I hope that we can one day get to a point where everyone realizes that women do not have to be modest to be respected. We are free to draw confidence and happiness in our own way, and it is never for someone else to choose for us or to even judge us for that matter.\"\n\n\"Women can be intelligent, fierce, sexy, powerful, strong, advocates for change while wearing what makes them feel best,\" Raisman said. \"The time where women are taught to be ashamed of their bodies is OVER. The female body is beautiful and we should all be proud of who we are, inside and out.\"\n\nThe series of pictures was shot and managed by an all-female team.\n\nI believe that everyone is a survivor of something,\" she told the magazine. Often times, we feel pressure to keep things in, and being a part of the social media age, we sometimes want to act like everything is perfect,\" Rasiman said.\n\nThe magazine's annual swimsuit issue also includes the more traditional photo shoots and features Danielle Herrington as the cover model.\n\nWatch Raisman discuss the photo shoot:\n\n\"I want to help change the conversation where we encourage people to trust themselves and use their voice. I encourage anyone out there to remember that you deserve to feel safe, everyone has a story, and everyone deserves to be heard. \"\n\nCheryl Wray covers sports for the Alabama Media Group.
