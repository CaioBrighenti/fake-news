Of course, their parts were originally played by Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze in the 1987 classic.\n\n\u201cCasually dancing around a fireplace, as one does,\u201d Breslin, 20, captioned one photo. \u201cAND just casually dippin\u2019 around a fireplace. As one also does,\u201d the actress wrote in her follow-up post.\n\nModern Family star Sarah Hyland also posted about her character Lisa Houseman, Baby\u2019s older, extroverted sister who falls in love with a womanizing waiter during their family\u2019s vacation at a Catskills resort. In the original movie, Lisa was played by Jane Brucker.\n\nHyland\u2019s boyfriend, Dom Sherwood, showed his support by posting another photo of the actress\u2019 musical skills. \u201cVery proud of ya! Learned ukulele and everything,\u201d the Shadowhunters actor captioned his post.\n\nWill & Grace star Debra Messing, who was cast to play Baby\u2019s mother, shared a collage of the festivities inside Catskills resort, revealing the first photos of actors Bruce Greenwood, Nicole Scherzinger and Billy Dee Williams in character.\n\n\u201cI am very excited,\u201d Messing tells PEOPLE. \u201cThe original movie was incredibly special to me. I remember seeing it when I was a kid with my mother and just falling in love with everything about it.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Top 5 Most Expensive Movies of All Time\n\nAs for what fans can expect from this new version, Messing tells PEOPLE, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a replica of the original. This takes some liberties. It has the DNA of the original, but you are going to find out what happened to Baby and Johnny after that summer ended. So there\u2019s some additional surprises in there that are new.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cMy hope is that people who loved the movie are going to be happy with all the things that are iconic with the movie, that they\u2019ll appreciate the things that are new and modernized with this version.\u201d\n\nDirected by Wayne Blair and choreographed by Hamilton\u2018s Andy Blankenbuehler, the remake will feature songs from the original Dirty Dancing as well as additional musical performances.\n\nThe three-hour film airs Wednesday, May 24, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images":
