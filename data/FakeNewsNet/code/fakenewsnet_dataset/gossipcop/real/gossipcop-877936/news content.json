Phan clearly connected with one of the young girl\u2019s stories, posting the sweet Instagram below.\n\n\u201cEddah\u2019s smile sums up the most beautiful week in Kenya,\u201d she writes. \u201cShe\u2019s holding leaves from an oleleshwa tree, which flourishes even in drought.

Jonathan Scott Weighs in\n\nThe oldest Scott brother shared his own photos from the trip, writing, \u201cWhat a week it\u2019s been in Kenya!\u201d alongside a photo collage.\n\nDrew\u2019s twin brother Jonathan was noticeably missing from the squad, but only because he had already traveled to Africa a few weeks prior with girlfriend Jacinta Kuznetsov.\n\nJonathan and Jacinta made their way through Uganda and Kenya, stopping at the United Nations and the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust along the way.\n\nRELATED: Property Brothers\u2018 Drew and Jonathan Scott on Filming in Louisiana During Devastating Floods: \u2018It Was Tragic\u2019\n\nWith their ongoing book tour and recently released furniture line, the Scotts are back in the states and as busy as ever. But they won\u2019t soon forget their trip.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all come home with bigger hearts, higher hopes and more fuel in our passion to be part of the change,\u201d Phan continued on her post.
