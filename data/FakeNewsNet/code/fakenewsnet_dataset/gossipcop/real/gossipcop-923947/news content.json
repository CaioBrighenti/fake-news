Shannon's Nisson Xterra was one of the cars targeted.\n\nPumpkin, Mama June's second youngest child, told police she had two guns stolen from her car \u2014 both were Ruger P-Series handguns. She says the firearms were located in a holster that was stashed under her seat.\n\nBoth weapons, she said, were fully loaded. For those that didn't know, Georgia is not a traditional open carry state, however it is legal to openly carry a firearm without a permit in a motor vehicle.\n\n\n\nTheBlast.com\n\nIn addition to the guns, Pumpkin told police her wallet was stolen. In her wallet, Pumpkin had her social security card and the social security card of her dead grandmother, Mary Francis Thompson.\n\nA few other hotel guests had items stolen as well, most notably an Apple MacBook Pro (see above).\n\nThe police have no suspects at this time and the investigation remains ongoing.", "images": ["https://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0328_Lauryn-Shannon.jpg?auto=format", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035223&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://theblast.com/static/theblast/logo.svg", "https://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0328_pumpkin_gun_report-1024x472.jpg"], "top_img": "https://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0328_Lauryn-Shannon.jpg?auto=format", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/mama-june-daughter-pumpkin-stolen-gun", "title": "Mama June's Daughter 'Pumpkin' Had Two Guns Stolen from Her Car", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "theme-color": "#f60", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mama June's Daughter 'Pumpkin' Had Two Guns Stolen from Her Car", "url": "https://theblast.com/c/mama-june-daughter-pumpkin-stolen-gun", "site_name": "The Blast", "description": "Lauryn Shannon (aka Pumpkin) had her car broken into last week and the list of items she had stolen includes two loaded firearms.", "image": {"identifier": "/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0328_Lauryn-Shannon.jpg?auto=format", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2018-03-28T20:48:19.000+00:00"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2019-06-10T22:45:31.000+00:00", "published_time": "2018-03-28T20:48:19.000+00:00", "section": "The Law", "tag": "Pumpkin", "publisher": "https://facebook.com/theblastnews"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBlastNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mama June's Daughter 'Pumpkin' Had Two Guns Stolen from Her Car", "description": "Lauryn Shannon (aka Pumpkin) had her car broken into last week and the list of items she had stolen includes two loaded firearms.", "image": "https://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0328_Lauryn-Shannon.jpg"}, "description": "Lauryn Shannon (aka Pumpkin) had her car broken into last week and the list of items she had stolen includes two loaded firearms.", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/theblast/icon-270.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522270099.0, "source": "https://theblast.com", "summary": ""}
