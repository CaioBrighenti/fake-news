Ariana Grande resurfaced on Twitter on Tuesday (April 17) night to tease brand new music.\n\nThe singing superstar hasn't been very active on social media since the new year started. In fact, Grande's last posts on both Twitter and Instagram were published on New Year's Eve (Dec. 31) 2017. So, imagine all of her diehard fans' surprise when she popped back up, out of nowhere, to announce that she's about to drop new music.\n\nBefore she made the announcement, Grande posted a rain drop emoji. Then, she tweeted, \"missed you.\" We guess this was the star's way of getting everyone's undivided attention, at first. Immediately after posting those two previously mentioned messages, Grande tweeted out, \"\u028e\u0279\u0254 o\u0287 \u0287\u025f\u01ddl s\u0279\u0250\u01dd\u0287 ou 4.20.\" Yes, we know how weird this looks. But, if you look at the upside down words, you can see that they say, \"no tears left to cry\" in reverse.\n\nNaturally, Grande's fans began crying tears of joy when they saw these tweets. Take a look at them below.", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/f605914f7a6afcb6da7f6bb47caa1afa?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(158,100),quality(90)", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270798540384083&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/icon_assets/YAC_Icon.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ad745843e4beffdd918ea4a?ops=max(650,0),quality(80)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ad745843e4beffdd918ea4a", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/f605914f7a6afcb6da7f6bb47caa1afa?ops=gravity(%22center%22),maxcontain(96,60)"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5ad745843e4beffdd918ea4a", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isha Thorpe"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-04-18-ariana-grande-resurfaces-to-tease-new-music-dropping-soon/", "title": "Ariana Grande Resurfaces To Tease New Music Dropping Soon", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Surprise, surprise!
