But the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson\u2018s dress was finally revealed on Friday as she walked down the aisle of St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle wearing a custom Peter Pilotto gown.\n\nSo how does her Peter Pilotto dress compare to her cousins\u2019 Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle\u2018s gowns?\n\nImage zoom Getty; AP (2)\n\nImage zoom Press Association via AP Images\n\nThe 28-year-old royal cousin of Prince William and Prince Harry chose a long-sleeve, low-back design from the London-based label, which was founded in 2007 by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos.\n\nImage zoom YUI MOK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe dress features a neckline that folds around the shoulders to a low back that drapes into a flowing full length train. The low back feature on the dress was at the request of Eugenie, who had surgery at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis.\n\nImage zoom Press Association via AP Images\n\n\u201cI think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it\u2019s really special to stand up for that,\u201d she told the U.K.\u2019s This Morning.\n\nPilotto and De Vos worked with Eugenie to research previous dresses worn by members of the royal family to identify the right silhouette for her wedding.\n\nImage zoom James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe fabric of her gown features a number of motifs that hold particularly special meaning to Eugenie. The symbols include a thistle for Scotland, to acknowledge her and Jack\u2019s fondness for Balmoral, a shamrock for Ireland as a reflection of her maternal family, the York rose and ivy to represent the couple\u2019s home.\n\nThe only bit of information she revealed before her big day was that she wanted to pick a designer from her home country. \u201c[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about,\u201d she told British Vogue. \u201cAs soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought I\u2019d be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I\u2019ve been pretty on top of it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Celebrity Guests Arrive at Princess Eugenie\u2019s Wedding\n\nUnlike Kate and Meghan, however, Princes Eugenie chose not to wear a veil.\n\nFor Kate\u2019s 2011 wedding to Prince William, she stuck with a British-based designer too, wearing a custom Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen lace long-sleeve, V-neck gown.\n\nImage zoom Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nBut it was Meghan\u2019s long-sleeved, unembellished gown that switched-up the British designer trend. U.K. designer Clare Waight Keller designed her custom creation, but for the brand, Givenchy, which is a French fashion house.\n\nImage zoom Meghan Markle\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

The tiara is made of brilliant and rose cut diamonds pav\u00e9 set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side and was bequeathed by Mrs. Greville to Queen Elizabeth in 1942.\n\nBoth Kate and Meghan also wore tiaras straight from the Queen\u2019s jewelry vault. Kate wore the Cartier Halo tiara and Meghan wore the Queen Mary Diamond Bandeau.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/684440673e7de9e6288f8fd2fb40dc8a?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/newsletter.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2075px%2C1089.375px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/kate-pippa-3-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/kate-eugenie-meghan.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1024px%2C537.6px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/duchess-cambridge-sussex-7-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C699.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/duchess-cambridge-sussex-4-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/victoria-beckham-a.jpg?crop=0px%2C28px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/princess-eugenie-6-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/princess-eugenie-8-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/dress-tout.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/kate-eugenie-meghan.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/idris-split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/polo-15.jpg?crop=0px%2C273px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/royals-double-date-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-kate-split.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/meghan-markle4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mehgan-split.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/polo-0.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/princess-eugenie-1-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/meghan-kate-pippa-6-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mr-mrs-jonas-1-1200.jpg?crop=66px%2C210px%2C931px%2C488px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/getty-lazzarato-wedding-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/princess-eugenie-1-20001.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/duchess-cambridge-green-1-1200x1200.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/trooping-the-colour-28-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C250px%2C1795px%2C941px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kat-mcphee.jpg?crop=0px%2C117px%2C1080px%2C568px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/polo-17.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/meghan-markle-handbag.jpg?crop=290px%2C0px%2C2291px%2C1202px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/demi-moore.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1372px%2C720.3px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/da5e7d01afedc1c31666e045b98aacc4?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kate-tout.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/kate-eugenie-meghan.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1024px%2C537.6px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil", "Kaitlyn Frey"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/princess-eugenie-royal-wedding-dress-compared-to-kate-middleton-meghan-markle/", "title": "Princess Eugenie's Wedding Dress Compared to Kate and Meghan's", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Jack Brooksbank,Kate Middleton,Meghan Markle,Princess Eugenie,Royal News,Royal Style,Royal Wedding,Style,Style News,Wedding Dresses,Wedding Style,Weddings", "news_keywords": "Jack Brooksbank,Kate Middleton,Meghan Markle,Princess Eugenie,Royal News,Royal Style,Royal Wedding,Style,Style News,Wedding Dresses,Wedding Style,Weddings", "description": "All the similarities (and major differences!) between Princess Eugenie's wedding gown compared to Kate Middleton's and Meghan Markle's", "og": {"title": "Royal Brides!
