I totally disavow this horrendous behavior and will have nothing to do with her,\u201d he wrote Sunday night.\n\nRavenel then commented on his own post, saying he \u201cbegged\u201d Jacobs to stop talking about Dennis.\n\n\u201cI begged her over and over to no avail. So hateful. Hope she gets help,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe former politician deleted the post just minutes later.\n\nImage zoom Thomas Ravenel Instagram Thomas Ravenel/Instagram\n\nDays earlier, Ravenel and Jacobs were spotted getting cuddly while out in downtown Charleston on Friday evening. Ravenel was seen walking with his arm around Jacobs as they entered Vintage Lounge on King St., where they mingled with friends and listened to live music throughout the night.\n\nThe post comes as Ravenel and Dennis continue to fight over the custody of their two children: daughter Kensie, 4, and son Saint, who turns 3 on Nov. 17.\n\nDennis, 27, filed documents in Charleston, South Carolina, on Oct. 25 seeking to obtain primary custody of the two children.\n\nIn her filing, obtained by PEOPLE, Dennis accused Ravenel, 56, of relying \u201cupon the use of full-time nannies,\u201d referenced the sexual assault allegations brought against him and his recent arrest, and alleged he \u201chas drunk alcohol to excess, mixed with prescription drugs, that has caused him to be impaired during periods of time in which he had custody of the children.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Thomas Ravenel Accuses Kathryn Dennis of Seeking Primary Custody for a Southern Charm Storyline\n\nDennis accused her ex of exhibiting \u201cperiods of impulsive and uncontrollable bouts of anger\u201d and \u201cextreme narcissism and anger management problems.\u201d Additionally, Dennis alleged that Ravenel encouraged Jacobs to \u201cverbally assault and attack\u201d her on the Bravo show.\n\nImage zoom Thomas Ravenel and Kathryn Dennis Kathryn Dennis/Instagram\n\nOn Nov. 6, Ravenel filed a counterclaim, vehemently denying all of Dennis\u2019 allegations and accusing her of filing her complaint \u201cin bad faith, for the purpose of garnering media attention, creating material for her storyline on Southern Charm and ensuring her marketability as a \u2018reality TV star.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIn his filing, obtained by PEOPLE, Ravenel alleged that Dennis\u2019 attempt to seek primary custody was \u201cfor the sole and/or primary purpose\u201d of securing her role on the show and \u201cprogressing her storyline as the \u2018rehabilitated mother who regains possession of her minor children.\u2019 \u201d (Dennis previously lost custody of the kids and entered rehab in 2016 after she failed a drug test. She has since earned back 50/50 custody.)\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Southern Charm\u2019s Ashley Jacobs Posts About \u2018Difficult Roads\u2019 Amid Thomas Ravenel Breakup Rumors\n\nAdditionally, Ravenel alleged that Dennis initiated her suit \u201cwith the encouragement, condonation and/or express or implied permission of the producers of Southern Charm, for the purpose of providing dramatic material for the next season.\u201d\n\nAlthough the photo blasting Jacobs was deleted, it marked the first time Ravenel has posted to social media since he was arrested and charged with assault and battery in the second degree in September following allegations of sexual assault brought against him by \u201cnanny Dawn,\u201d who was featured on the show caring for his children.\n\nEarlier this month, a South Carolina judge found probable cause for second-degree assault and battery charges against Ravenel in a preliminary hearing, ruling that the case will head to trial.\n\nFollowing his arrest, Bravo confirmed to PEOPLE that Ravenel will not be returning as a cast member for season 6. Jacobs also said she will not film again.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/kathryn-dennis-life-6.jpg",
