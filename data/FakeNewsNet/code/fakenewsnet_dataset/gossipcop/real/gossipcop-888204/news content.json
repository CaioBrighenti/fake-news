Wolfpack completed with a 9lb, lean, eating machine (and a Decker bucket head)! Mommy sure knows how to grow some babies!!\u201d\n\nThe Deckers first revealed they were expecting back in October, and shortly after, got the whole family in on a video to reveal that they\u2019d be having another boy. New baby Decker boy joins big sister Vivianne Rose, 4, and brother Eric Jr., 2.\n\nLast month, Eric shared a still from the iconic film Forrest Gump, which fans are now realizing they should have taken as a naming sign. In the last Instagram update from Jessie before giving birth, she said that the third would be their last. Congrats to the Decker family!\n\nWhat do you think of the name Forrest?
