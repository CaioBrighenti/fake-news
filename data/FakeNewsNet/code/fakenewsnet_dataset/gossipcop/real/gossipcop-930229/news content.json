Though there has been official speculation that the prince will receive the title of either Albert or Arthur, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been mum on his moniker\u2014until now. While arriving at the opening of the Greenhouse Centre in London with Prince Harry , Prince William responded to a reporter's direct question about the name. \"I\u2019m working on it, I\u2019m working on it,\" he said. Sounds like Wills is just as stressed as the rest of us!\n\nDespite all the secrecy, there may have been a big break in the Mystery of the Unnamed Prince on Thursday. Some eager code-crackers over at The Daily Mail may have found a secret landing page on the royal family's website reserved for a Prince Albert. Though this seems like it could be the strongest evidence yet to support Team Albert, there is an existing member of the royal family, Queen Victoria's husband , with the same name. It seems impossible to tell if the secret site is reserved for a younger Albert, or merely a duplicate link for the one who lived in the 1800s.\n\nSee more: Prince William Dozing Off at Westminster Abbey Is Peak New Dad\n\nUntil we get the official word from William and Kate themselves, the public will just have to keep speculating about the new addition to the royal family. But luckily, Prince William offered up some other news on Thursday to keep us busy: The 35-year-old responded to the official news that he will serve as Prince Harry's best man at the royal wedding next month. As for his speech , William simply revealed, \"Revenge is sweet.\" Let's hope baby Albert (or whatever his name will be!) makes an appearance during the toast.", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5d2616e66923c40008df6127/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-925301266.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5ae230d502425305f8762032/master/pass/prince-william-kate-middleton-havent-selected-a-baby-name.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5ae230d502425305f8762032/1:1/w_767/prince-william-kate-middleton-havent-selected-a-baby-name.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5ba913ea2d0b7d466eb6cb38/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1040501362.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5bc49605a9dc642d7745b9b3/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1051952284.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5ae230d502425305f8762032/master/pass/prince-william-kate-middleton-havent-selected-a-baby-name.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/prince-william-working-on-name-royal-baby", "title": "Prince William Says He Is Still \"Working On\" a Name for the New Royal Baby\u2014But It May Have Accidentally Been Revealed", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Three days after the birth of his newborn son, Prince William says he and Kate Middleton are still \"working on\" a name for the youngest prince.", "og": {"description": "Oops!", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5ae230d502425305f8762032/master/pass/prince-william-kate-middleton-havent-selected-a-baby-name.jpg", "title": "A Glitch on the Royal Family's Website Might Have Revealed the Royal Baby's Name", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/prince-william-working-on-name-royal-baby", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oops!", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5ae230d502425305f8762032/master/pass/prince-william-kate-middleton-havent-selected-a-baby-name.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "A Glitch on the Royal Family's Website Might Have Revealed the Royal Baby's Name", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/prince-william-working-on-name-royal-baby", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "snd,News,Kate Middleton", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,snd,News,Kate Middleton"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
