Reaching,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann said in her defense. \u201cDon\u2019t try it. It has nothing to do with the projects or none of that s\u2014. A roach is a roach.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Moses Robinson/Bravo\n\nRELATED: \u2018Close Your Legs to Married Men\u2019: A Brief History of Kim Zolciak-Biermann & NeNe Leakes\u2019 Rocky Friendship\n\nThough she appeared to shrug off the negativity during the ferocious fight, rolling her eyes and calming walking off set after it was done, Zolciak-Biermann broke down in tears while talking to Cohen after the show\u2019s wrap.\n\n\u201cThat bitch knows I\u2019m not racist. NeNe knows I\u2019m not racist,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann told Cohen. \u201cYou know why you have not found another white woman to [join the cast]? Because nobody is dumb enough to do that! Put yourself in my shoes \u2014 five African-American women \u2014 just hammered! I couldn\u2019t even speak, my mind\u2019s a f\u2014\u2014 whirlwind!\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Everyone of those m\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 on that couch owe this world a f\u2014\u2014 apology for this racism s\u2014,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann said. \u201cThey already tried to claim that s\u2014 long ago. Nobody bought into it then because the social media wasn\u2019t there and racism wasn\u2019t f\u2014\u2014 all that real. You know it.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images; Paras Griffin/Getty Images\n\nIn the wake of #RoachGate, as it was come to be known, Leakes had responded with her own slams \u2014 calling Zolciak-Biermann \u201cracist\u201d and claiming she and her daughter Brielle \u201cdon\u2019t like black people.\n\n\u201cKim & her daughter oops whole family are racists! What her daughter did at my home\u2026 was racist, learned behavior etc,\u201d Leakes, 50, alleged in a comment on Instagram, adding, \u201cKim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat word \u2018roach\u2019 just ain\u2019t the word I needed to hear her saying,\u201d Leakes said on a RHOA episode. \u201cIt sounds very racial when you are speaking to an African-American person and talk about roaches. Because people feel like you associated that with the ghetto or trash. Black people do not receive that very well.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: RHOA\u2018s Kim Zolciak Says She Received Death Threats After NeNe Leakes Called Her \u2018Racist\u2019\n\nZolciak-Biermann didn\u2019t take Leakes\u2019 claims lightly. As #RoachGate played out on social media, the \u201cTardy for the Party\u201d singer obtained legal counsel against Leakes.\n\n\u201cShe put #KKK on the Instagram post. I\u2019ve hired legal counsel at this point. It\u2019s just that bad,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann told Larry King on Larry King Now in October. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate. In this day and age, people are dying over racism. I\u2019m on a show with all African-American women and I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s ever been on the show that\u2019s Caucasian, so it\u2019s the card that sometimes they play and it\u2019s gross. And I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nThe Don\u2019t Be Tardy star later revealed on RHOA that she received death threats after Leakes\u2019 racist claims. \u201cShe wants to pull the race card. That\u2019s the devil, bitch,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. Not me, my husband, or my children see color. Never have.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Moses Robinson/Bravo\n\nApologies and cease fire requests have since been made by Zolciak-Biermann, though Leakes hasn\u2019t accepted them.\n\nBy episode\u2019s end on Sunday, it was clear the two would never be mending their relationship and that Zolciak-Biermann\u2019s time on RHOA was done for good (Zolciak-Biermann confirmed the latter recently, saying she was never returning again).\n\nIt was sad to see for fans of the show, who remember Zolciak-Biermann giving RHOA some of its most iconic moments when it first premiered in October 2008.\n\nBut as Zolciak-Biermann claimed when she left RHOA halfway through season 5, the show became too negative. And judging from the way season 10 went, that never fixed itself.\n\nImage zoom Alex Martinez/Bravo\n\nWho\u2019s to blame for that? In the Atlanta Housewives eyes, it was Zolciak-Biermann.\n\nAt the reunion, Leakes, Burruss, Moore, and Bailey all slammed her for starting feuds and spreading hate. \u201cIt\u2019s all me, it\u2019s all me,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann shrugged off. \u201cSure. Sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much can a person take?\u201d Zolciak-Biermann asked Cohen in the show\u2019s final moments. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even one positive question for me. I was hammered! \u2026 There wasn\u2019t a positive question. I have a very success marriage, I have beautiful children, there was nothing positive.\u201d\n\nCohen, though, appeared to agree with the RHOA cast.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing positive, unfortunately, in your story from the season,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt was all combative, it was. Because your whole time on the show as combative, it was.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/nene-leakes-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/nene-leakes-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kim-zolciak1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/nene-leakes1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/nene-leakes-2.jpg?crop=381px%2C432px%2C1619px%2C849px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59d6486f5205aabdbf65fd1a39fa97ee?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/nene-leakes-2.jpg?crop=381px%2C432px%2C1619px%2C849px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-zolciak-biermann-claims-racism-wasnt-real/", "title": "RHOA Reunion: Kim Zolciak-Biermann Angry Over Racist Claims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Andy Cohen,Cynthia Bailey,Kandi Burruss,Kenya Moore,Kim Zolciak Biermann,NeNe Leakes,News,Porsha Williams,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of Atlanta,Sheree Whitfield", "news_keywords": "Andy Cohen,Cynthia Bailey,Kandi Burruss,Kenya Moore,Kim Zolciak Biermann,NeNe Leakes,News,Porsha Williams,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of Atlanta,Sheree Whitfield", "description": "Kim Zolciak-Biermann\u00a0was far from happy with how her appearance on the\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta\u00a0reunion went", "og": {"title": "RHOA's Kim Zolciak-Biermann Claims Racism 'Wasn't Real' and Is Magnified by Social Media", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-zolciak-biermann-claims-racism-wasnt-real/", "description": "Kim Zolciak-Biermann\u00a0was far from happy with how her appearance on the\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta\u00a0reunion went.", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/nene-leakes-2.jpg?crop=381px%2C432px%2C1619px%2C849px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-zolciak-biermann-claims-racism-wasnt-real/", "description": "Kim Zolciak-Biermann\u00a0was far from happy with how her appearance on the\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta\u00a0reunion went", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/nene-leakes-2.jpg?crop=381px%2C432px%2C1619px%2C849px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-zolciak-biermann-claims-racism-wasnt-real/", "title": "RHOA's Kim Zolciak-Biermann Claims Racism 'Wasn't Real' and Is Magnified by Social Media", "description": "Kim Zolciak-Biermann\u00a0was far from happy with how her appearance on the\u00a0Real Housewives of Atlanta\u00a0reunion went", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/nene-leakes-2.jpg?crop=381px%2C432px%2C1619px%2C849px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
