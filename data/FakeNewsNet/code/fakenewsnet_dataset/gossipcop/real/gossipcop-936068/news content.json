But please don\u2019t,\u201d wrote Hyland. \u201cThank you for being the @stevehowey to my @katehudson in #bridewars \u2026 Now, let\u2019s get tan again and drink all the ros\u00e9.\u201d\n\nAdams also shared a slideshow of candid selfies of the couple smiling and kissing.\n\n\u201cA couple hours after we took these pics, @sarahhyland said \u2018when are you going to ask me to be your girlfriend.\u2019 I said, \u2018right now,\u2019 \u201d he revealed. \u201cI then doubled down and said \u2018I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u2019 She responded with, \u2018I can\u2019t say that yet.\u2019 And then like 15 minutes later she did.
