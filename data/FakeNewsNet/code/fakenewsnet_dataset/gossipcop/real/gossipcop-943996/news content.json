News reports.\n\nThe Goldbergs actor was found dead in a Los Angeles sober living home on Friday, the L.A. County Coroner\u2019s Office told PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cThere was no paraphernalia or legal drugs found on the scene,\u201d Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cHe was found unresponsive.\u201d\n\nOdell\u2019s cause of death is pending an autopsy. His family released a statement on his Twitter page following his death.\n\n\u201cThe Odell family has lost our beloved son and brother, Jackson Odell, on Friday,\u201d the statement read. \u201cHe will always be a shining light and a brilliant, loving and talented soul. He had so much more to share. Our family will always carry that truth forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur wish is that the rest of the world who knew and loved him does as well,\u201d the family continued. \u201cWe are now going to try to make sense of our immeasurable loss privately. We will not be making anymore statements.\u201d\n\nBrett Boyett, a music producer who met Odell when he was 17 and who worked extensively with the actor for the past three years, shared a heartfelt tribute to the late actor on Facebook.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until he played the guitar and sand that I was completely blown away,\u201d Boyett wrote. \u201cThis kid could sing, write, and play the guitar like I could only have dreamed of at 17. I mean, he could do it all, and he was really, really good at all of it.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jackson Odell Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty\n\n\u201cHis voice carved a story into your mind with every word that he sang while playing the guitar with the precision of a seasoned professional musician,\u201d he continued. \u201cI wanted so badly to see him become successful, the world needed to know how much talent was inside of this kid and how rare of a find he was.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Goldbergs Actor Jackson Odell, 20, Was Found Dead in a Sober Living Home\n\n\u201cThe world has lost an artist with literally some of the most God given talent I have ever seen,\u201d Boyett added. \u201cHis family and friends have lost a son, a brother, and a friend. I\u2019ll miss you, buddy. Thank you for sharing your talent with me. He was 20 years old. He was brilliant. I don\u2019t really know how else to say it.
