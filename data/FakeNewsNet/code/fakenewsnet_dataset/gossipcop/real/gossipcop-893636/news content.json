The star-studded event marked Williams\u2019 first post-baby red carpet appearance since welcoming her first child with fianc\u00e9 Alexis Ohanian in September.\n\n\u201cGigi, you are one of the few people on this planet I would leave my baby for \u2014 for one night \u2014 but for you, it shows how much you mean to me. And I want you to imagine the effect you have on the world,\u201d the mother of one, 36, said before giving the award to the 22-year-old supermodel.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Not only beautiful on the outside but totally stunning most importantly on the inside,\u201d the 23-time Grand Slam champion also said during her presenter\u2019s speech. \u201cShe understands in order to be the best you have to think like you are the best. You have to work the hardest and you have to make sacrifices.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Serena Williams Reveals She\u2019s Back in Her Jean Shorts Just 2 Weeks After Giving Birth\n\nAdding, \u201cShe\u2019s inspirational to me and she\u2019s inspirational to all women. Most of all she is my friend. When I see her I sometimes still see that blushing kid with big dreams and big hopes.\u201d\n\nSince her daughter\u2019s birth, Williams has been sharing shots of her sweet baby girl on social media, most recently an adorable video of Alexis Olympia boarding a private plane.\n\nWhile Tuesday marked her first public appearance since baby, Williams recently celebrated her upcoming nuptials to Ohanian \u2014 who proposed to her in December 2016 \u2014 by throwing a luxurious girls\u2019 weekend in New York City, which included five-star spa treatments, trapeze-ing, tea brunches, and dancing out on the town with famous friends Lala Anthony and Ciara as well as sister Venus Williams.", "images":
