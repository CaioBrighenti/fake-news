The former couple\u2019s divorce has yet to be finalized.\n\nThe July 4th visit comes just a week after the president\u2019s eldest son and the Fox News host went on a fishing trip together in Montana.\n\nTrump Jr. also gave his father a series of bizarre shoutouts on social media for the July Fourth holiday, sharing a series of patriotic fan-created images on Instagram.\n\nIn one image, Trump is depicted wearing an old-fashioned uniform while holding a massive weapon in one hand. Meanwhile, a bald eagle is perched on his other arm, while an American flag waved in the background amid battle imagery.\n\n\u201cThis is amazing. #fourthofjuly #4thofjuly #trump #maga\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\u201d his son captioned the image.\n\nThe second post appears to depict his father as Salt Bae, only instead of salt, \u201cFreedom Bae\u201d is sprinkling red white and blue stars.\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered footage of Freedom Bae!!!
