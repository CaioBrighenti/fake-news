Ros\u00e9 is probably the oldest known type of wine, dating back as far as 600 BC. Ros\u00e9 wines are generally made from red grapes and are very versatile wines that complement many types of food. Ros\u00e9 is lighter than red wine and deeper than white wine. The pink color of ros\u00e9 wine depends on the time the grape skin stays in contact with the juice, also known as maceration. There are ros\u00e9 wines that are semi-sparkling or sparkling, with different intensities of sweetness levels and dryness.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\n\nCelebrate National Ros\u00e9 Day by having a bottle of Ros\u00e9 wine with dinner or simply invite friends over for h\u2019orderves and enjoy each other\u2019s company.
