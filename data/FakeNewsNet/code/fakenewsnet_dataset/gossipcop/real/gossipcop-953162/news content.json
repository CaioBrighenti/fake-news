Here We Go Again this weekend, fans of the ABBA-inspired musical can now add Amanda Seyfried's Wednesday night (July 18) appearance on The Tonight Show to their list of reasons to be super hyped for the sequel.\n\nThe actress stopped by to hang with Jimmy Fallon and promote the film, so of course she was invited to play a game with the always-playful talk show host. And Seyfried was more than game to be the latest victim of Fallon's Google Translate Song Challenge bit, which this time reworked the 1970s Swedish supergroup's pop nuggets into Slovenian and then back into English for, yes, hilarious results.\n\nSeyfried sang an all-new version of \"Dancing Queen\" called \"Hula Prince\" that had a twist ending that left the audience laughing. Fallon then worked through a revamp of \"Take A Chance On Me\" renamed \"Steal My Sad Clocks,\" before closing out the Challenge with a duet of the movie's titular song \"Mamma Mia!\" which translated to \"My Mom Arrived!\"\n\nWatch the full video of Amanda Seyfried's hilarious performance of \"Hula Prince\" below.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/02-BB16-exec-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/amanda-seyfried-tonight-show-july-18-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1554285401541797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/879509920/?value=1.00&currency_code=USD&label=wh8cCLa922cQoIOxowM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1531926410/images/Billboard-white.svg?d20c072e0ce022396b31", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/02-BB16-exec-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/amanda-seyfried-tonight-show-july-18-2018-billboard-1548.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250im_/https://www.billboard.com/files/media/amanda-seyfried-tonight-show-july-18-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alessandra Rinc\u00f3n"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719192250/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8466146/tonight-show-amanda-seyfried-sings-google-translated-abba-songs-mamma-mia", "title": "Amanda Seyfried Sings Hilarious Google Translated 'Mamma Mia!'
