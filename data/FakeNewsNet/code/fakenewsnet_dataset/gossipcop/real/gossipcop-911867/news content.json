Jordan's glo up is ah-mazing, leaving many fans anxiously awaiting to see him show off his perfectly sculpted muscles on Marvel Studios' Black Panther, which will hit theaters Feb. 16.\n\nWhile the 30-year-old actor has been super fit since he bulked for his lead in Creed, it's clear that he's on his fitness \u2014 but getting the perfect body doesn't come without lots of work (and less of a social life) which he confessed while appearing on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. \"I'm just trying to stay in shape for as long as I can,\" the actor shared with Ellen. \"Why not? Right?\"\n\nI'm working... A post shared by Michael B. Jordan (@michaelbjordan) on Sep 29, 2016 at 11:56am PDT\n\nSo how did he get his body right for his role as Erik Killmonger? Drinking over a gallon of water daily was clearly a necessity while making sure he worked out two to three times a day. His eating regimen of six times a day was even more crucial and complicated, especially when it came to his social life: \"It's hard to go out to a club or a party when you're like, 'Oh, wait! Meal prep! We gotta go pop this thing in the microwave and eat food,'\" the actor laughed while sharing with Ellen. \"It's tough to socialize when you gotta get in shape like that.\"\n\nStill working...

Jordan (@michaelbjordan) on Jan 23, 2017 at 10:53am PST\n\nWe're pretty sure being roomies with his parents helped with his social life, tho: \u201cI love my parents but we have a roommate relationship right now, which is interesting,\u201d he shared. \u201cYou get home-cooked meals but then you also have random trips to the kitchen in the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nYum! Home cooked meals beats any club food, hands down. Anyway, we don't know about y'all, but we want him to keep it up, because he's lookin' good...\n\n...just sayin', tho. But with Creed II beginning production in April, we're sure he's going to keep his build.\n\nWritten by Tweety Elitou", "images": ["https://www.bet.com/style/living/2018/02/08/michael-b--jordan-social-life/_jcr_content/image.large2x1image.dimg/__1518124123639__1518117189623/020818-style-michael-b-jordan-social-life.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035012&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.bet.com/video/betawards/2019/exclusives/elijah-blake-black-is-love-beta19/_jcr_content/squareImage.trendingthumb.dimg/__1561585171543__1561585141847/betx19-instacarpet-final.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1725845810983009&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bet.com/video/betawards/2019/acceptance-speeches/dr-bobby-jones-award-beta19/_jcr_content/squareImage.trendingthumb.dimg/__1561346953419__1546874395995/010719-shows-bet-breaks-Snoop-Dogg-2.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=331289063738687&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/07/02/celebrities-and-the-internet-react-to-the-viral-cucumber-challen/_jcr_content/squareImage.trendingthumb.dimg/__1562101746565__1562101679378/070219-style-reginae-carter-toya-wright-masika-kalysha-cucumber-challenge.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bet.com/style/living/2018/02/08/michael-b--jordan-social-life/_jcr_content/image.large2x1image.dimg/__1518124123639__1518117189623/020818-style-michael-b-jordan-social-life.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tweety Elitou", "Written Tweety Elitou"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bet.com/style/living/2018/02/08/michael-b--jordan-social-life.html", "title": "See Why Michael B.
