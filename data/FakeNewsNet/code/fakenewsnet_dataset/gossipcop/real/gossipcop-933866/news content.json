Entertainment\n\nJosh Henderson and everyone else from \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d are adamant about this.\n\nThey say their new drama on E! \u2014 a crazy cocktail of Hollywood fame, wealth, excess, power, faith, secrets and romance \u2014 is not a thinly veiled Tom Cruise-Katie Holmes-Scientology story.\n\nMaybe they honestly didn\u2019t realize that parallels existed until it was recently pointed out to them. But once one sees the TomKat angle in E!\u2019s new scripted series, it\u2019s hard to pretend it\u2019s not there.\n\nHenderson \u2014 in his return to television after playing John Ross Ewing III for three seasons in \u201cDallas\u201d (2012-2014) \u2014 stars in \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d as Kyle West, the biggest film star in the world.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to Star-Telegram content across all your devices. SAVE NOW\n\nIn the debut episode, airing at 9 p.m. Sunday, Kyle meets and falls for no-name actress Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista) when she auditions for his next summer movie blockbuster.\n\nAfter one whirlwind day of romance (in which he whisks her away via private jet to an idyllic island in Mexico), Kyle\u2019s \u201cteam\u201d offers her $10 million to become his girlfriend/fiancee/bride.\n\nMegan is told that the contract marriage proposal is a way to control tabloid media coverage of Kyle\u2019s personal life and to protect his image and his \u201cbrand.\u201d\n\nShe is torn: She genuinely connected with the guy, even though they are fundamentally different in a multitude of ways. But play-acting a romance for money, no matter how it\u2019s rationalized, is just a crass and dishonest thing to do.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the people who cooked up this scheme run a secretive and maybe a bit shady self-help/empowerment organization called the Institute of the Higher Mind. This group, led by charismatic Terence Anderson (Michael Vartan), has a huge say in all of Kyle\u2019s career moves and life choices.\n\nThe Institute is the pivotal plot point that has many critics connecting the dots to Cruise and Scientology. After all, there has been much tabloid media speculation over the years that the Cruise-Holmes marriage was this kind of calculatedly arranged union \u2014 and that his ties to Scientology were part of it.\n\n\u201cI just saw this as a truly unique story,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cYou can see the comparisons considering that Tom\u2019s an actor, Kyle West is an actor, they\u2019re both huge film stars and it\u2019s set in Hollywood. But at the end of the day, we\u2019re really telling our own unique story.\u201d\n\nAdds Evangelista: \u201cIt\u2019s natural for people to compare. But very soon, early on, you see that these people have their own history, their own relationship and we\u2019re not deriving it from any actual people.\u201d\n\nThe premise is a perfect fit for E!, which has teams of entertainment reporters dissecting the private lives of real-life stars.\n\nJonathan Abrahams, the creator and executive producer of \u201cThe Arrangement,\u201d has said that his interest was not specially in Scientology, but in the controversial self-help/empowerment industry in general (i.e. Lifespring, Landmark Worldwide, EST).\n\nThat said, during a panel discussion at the Television Critics Association\u2019s winter meetings in January, Abrahams was asked point-blank if Cruise was a major source of inspiration \u2014 and what\u2019s more, if the show were modeled after the TomKat story, could the producer admit it publicly?\n\nHis non-answer answer went like this: \u201cEven if I could say that I could legally do it, I don\u2019t have the authority to say that.\u201d\n\nUltimately, of course, it won\u2019t matter what the source of inspiration was.\n\nThe show\u2019s success or failure will be determined by sustained viewer interest in the characters, whose romance is fraught with obstacles even before the complicated relationship contract comes into play.\n\nIt apparently didn\u2019t work when Tom and Katie tried it. Maybe Kyle and Megan will have better luck.", "images": ["https://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/2ny48n/picture135433264/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Arrangement2", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/northeast-tarrant/dm3iyw/picture168312972/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Bedford%20boys%20ranch%20file", "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/ofemqc/picture231741893/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/IMG-0171.JPG", "https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=5975&contextPath=3187-5975&pubId=11&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=135433274&type=article&title=%E2%80%98The+Arrangement%E2%80%99+tip-toes+around+TomKat+parallels&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.star-telegram.com%2Fentertainment%2Farts-culture%2Farticle135433274.html", "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/g60idm/picture232175067/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/peach%20festival%20cups.jpg", "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/14r2up/picture231963208/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/River%20Legacy%20Living%20Science%20Center.jpg", "https://www.star-telegram.com/wps/build/images/dfw/logo.png", "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/g60idm/picture232175067/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/peach%20festival%20cups.jpg", "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/s50d3e/picture231825513/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/5%20%20Haring-K_Untitled_1982-Heart.jpg", "https://www.star-telegram.com/news/local/community/bangg0/picture232277712/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Arts%20Center%20(2).jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/2ny48n/picture135433264/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Arrangement2", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Martindale", "Special To The Star-Telegram", "Daniel Power", "Rick Mauch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article135433274.html", "title": "'The Arrangement' riffs on Tom Cruise-Katie Holmes relationship", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/dfw/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "startelegram", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 tip-toes around TomKat parallels", "description": "New E! series appears lifted from the real-life relationship between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, but producers won\u2019t admit it.", "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/2ny48n/picture135433264/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Arrangement2"}, "og": {"site_name": "star-telegram", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 tip-toes around TomKat parallels", "url": "https://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article135433274.html", "description": "New E! series appears lifted from the real-life relationship between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, but producers won\u2019t admit it.", "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/entertainment/arts-culture/2ny48n/picture135433264/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Arrangement2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155812681283151, "pages": 17636558529}, "title": "'The Arrangement' riffs on Tom Cruise-Katie Holmes relationship | Fort Worth Star-Telegram", "allow-comments": "true", "description": "New E! series appears lifted from the real-life relationship between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, but producers won\u2019t admit it.", "keywords": "The Arrangement, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Scientology, TomKat, Hollywood, E!", "news_keywords": "The Arrangement, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Scientology, TomKat, Hollywood, E!", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "zLQTVtfwr_FaFe6A7f-Yxjz2dhOn4VTFy87suqUWDLo", "article": {"content_tier": "metered"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"article_id\": \"135433274\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.star-telegram.com", "summary": ""}
