I don\u2019t want a ton of foundation\u2019,\u201d Lydia F. Sellers, who worked with Markle for two years prior to her recent move to the UK, told Refinery29 this month.\n\n\u201cIt was more about the amount of product that went on her skin and keeping it really fresh and dewy, rather than caking it on.\u201d\n\nThe foundation in question used for that flawless finish is Giorgio Armani\u2019s Luminous Silk Foundation, which (hurrah!) you can snap up right here in Dubai.\n\nThe lightweight liquid, which can be built up for a medium coverage, is Dhs245 at Sephora.ae or Ounass.ae, and can also be picked up department stores including Woojoh, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Harvey Nichols-Dubai.\n\nA post shared by L Y D I A S E L L E R S (@lydiasellers_) on Nov 28, 2017 at 5:59pm PST\n\nSellers added that she sheered out the foundation with a Beautyblender, which you can also find at Sephora for Dhs84.\n\nThe makeup artist also revealed that Markle is a fan of eco-friendly brands RMS (Cult Beauty ships to the UAE) and Tatcha (available at Sephora), and sang the actress\u2019 down-to-earth approach to beauty.\n\n\u201cEven now, her look has stayed the same. She\u2019ll throw her hair back in a low bun and it actually looks like she\u2019s done it herself, and it\u2019s beautiful and chic because she\u2019s so confident,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about Meghan \u2014 she\u2019s so confident with herself and her look, and she sticks with that.\u201d Markle previously revealed in a BeautyBanter interview that she also relies on YSL Touche \u00c9clat (Dhs215, beauty counters across the UAE), NARS blush (Dhs170, Sephora), Nivea Skin Firming Hydration Body Lotion and the Kerastas\u00e9 Oleo Relax line (from Dhs125 at Kerastas\u00e9.ae).\n\nRead:\n\nDoes anyone wear this Lebanese label better than Angelina Jolie?\n\nWill Meghan Markle wear a Middle Eastern designer on her big day?\n\nRight, we\u2019re
