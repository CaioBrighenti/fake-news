So I\u2019m not upset that I have to answer these questions, but there are moments that I have where I\u2019m like, \u2018I want to be my own person, I want to stand as my own person.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s actually what drives me to work and do my own thing and want to make my own mark,\u201d she continued. \u201cBecause I want to be seen as my own person \u2014 even though I have all these amazing people in my life that I love so much.\u201d\n\n#EXCLUSIVE: Model @sofiarichie is in Australia for the very first time and meeting some very lucky fans at @WindsorSmith in Bondi Junction! \u2728 #WSxSOFIA #TMS7 pic.twitter.com/EtKRM5mORY \u2014 The Morning Show (@morningshowon7) September 6, 2018\n\nRichie and Scott have been officially dating since last September after initially sparking romance rumors in spring 2017.\n\nThough the couple has strived to keep their relationship private, it\u2019s been broached on the current season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever been with anybody other than Kourtney [Kardashian], so it\u2019s definitely different, but it\u2019s been a really good thing for me,\u201d Disick said on the Aug. 5 episode. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different for me to talk about what\u2019s going on now. Sometimes I feel guilty that I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne part of me is really happy that I\u2019m able to care about somebody again, but there always is some feeling in the back of me that feels guilty because I\u2019m moving on from Kourtney,\u201d he added.\n\nNevertheless, Disick said he was doing \u201camazing, for like, the first time in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Kourtney and I have been through a lot. It\u2019s an ongoing struggle, but I think she\u2019s doing well now and I\u2019m happy for her,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that I\u2019m able to now live my life the way I should.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kourtney Kardashian \u2018Trusts\u2019 Sofia Richie with Her and Scott Disick\u2019s Kids: Source\n\nAnd while tensions will rise on this Sunday\u2019s episode after Kardashian, 39, finds out Disick introduced Richie to their kids, sources have told PEOPLE that though the relationship raised eyebrows at first, as long as it helps keep the father of three on track, they have Kardashian\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u201cSofia is helping Scott be a better, healthier person,\u201d said one source. \u201cKourtney feels confident that Scott and Sofia take good care of the kids.
