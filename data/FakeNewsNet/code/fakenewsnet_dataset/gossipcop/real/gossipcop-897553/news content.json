Killing a major character in their very first episode, things only got bloodier from there, as more fell to the crazed cult of zombie-flesh-wearing killers by season's end. Certainly, few will forget the show's very own version of the Red Wedding any time soon.\n\nIt probably won't be their last casualty either, not if the Whisperers' ruthless leader, Alpha, has anything to say about it. In fact, season 10 could see another war break out between a militia formed by the remaining communities and the Whisperers, one that will cut a few more lives short.\n\nBut for now, many of your favorite characters are still safe. Will they remain that way when the show returns this fall? Only time will tell, although we wouldn't get too attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor your reading pleasure, we've compiled a list of all the characters who died in season 9 as well as those who lived to fight on another day.\n\nHere we go...AGAIN, MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW!\n\nDEAD\n\nHenry (Matt Lintz)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nResult: Dead\n\nHenry was decapitated by the Whisperers.\n\nFurther Reading: The Walking Dead Season 9 Ending Explained\n\nEnid (Katelyn Nacon)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nResult: Dead\n\nEnid was decapitated by the Whisperers.\n\nRelated Article: Everything You Need to Know About The Walking Dead Season 10\n\nTara Chambler (Alanna Masterson)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nResult: Dead\n\nTara was decapitated by the Whisperers.\n\nPaul \"Jesus\" Rovia (Tom Payne)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nResult: Dead\n\nJesus was stabbed by a Whisperer while holding back the horde at the graveyard.\n\nArat (Elizabeth Ludlow)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nResult: Dead\n\nArat was executed for her past crimes by members of Oceanside.\n\nGregory (Xander Berkeley)\n\nPrediction: Dies\n\nResult: Dead\n\nGregory was hanged by Maggie in a public execution after he plotted to have her killed.\n\nMIA\n\nRick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln)\n\nPrediction: Dies\n\nResult: MIA\n\nAfter being severely wounded while saving the communities from a walker horde, Jadis cuts a deal with the mysterious chopper to transport Rick to parts unknown.
