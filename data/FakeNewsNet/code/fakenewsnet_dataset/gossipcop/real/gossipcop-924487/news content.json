Reply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\nShe\u2019s probably going to disappear again after tour, which ends in November. Tour starts in just over a month so what has she got to lose? This stuff gets her name out there, disproves the criticism she\u2019s been getting and might help sell tickets who knows. Reply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\nThis makes sense. I said before that I sort of think she's \"flopping\"/not promoting for a reason which is that reputation is a mishmash of 1989 rejects and half written songs cobbled together in order to appease a certain tier of her fans that keep her name out there while she maybe didn't fully want to put out an album or have a concept the way she did with 1989 and RED. I feel like it's all a precursor to her leaving the popstar diva thing behind for a while while still giving her the option to come back since she said this album was more cathartic than anything and so I feel like she's feel like she got the last word/said her piece.\n\n\n\nETA I feel like she's a low key baby liberal who probably both doesn't want to anger her parents by ruffling too many feathers (the way Demi goes at it for example) and knows that she gets money from the conservative fan base and grew up during the era of the Dixie Chicks backlash. I feel like she's starting to become slightly disillusioned with this life she dreamt up for herself when she was 13.\n\n\n\nEdited at 2018-03-31 11:04 am (UTC) Reply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\nExpand\n\nLink\n\nShe got her album and tour sales so she got nothing to worry about as far as this era goes tbh .
