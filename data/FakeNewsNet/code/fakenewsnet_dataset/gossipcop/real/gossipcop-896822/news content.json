Alexi Lubomirski via Getty\n\nEver since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their engagement, we have gotten the scoop on everything from the wedding date, to the venue, to the gorgeous engagement ring. But one important question has remained unanswered: How did these two lovebirds meet in the first place?\n\nWe already know that a \"mutual friend\" introduced the pair, as Harry revealed in their first post-engagement interview with the BBC. Since neither of them knew much about the other before their first blind date, \"it was just a really authentic and organic way to get to know each other,\" Meghan said. (Believe it or not, the royal couple may be cousins.)\n\nBut now, we can finally put a name to the mystery matchmaker: Violet von Westenholz. The daughter of a baron, von Westenholz is a childhood friend of Harry's who also works in public relations with Ralph Lauren, which eventually led her to connect with Meghan.\n\nClarence House announced the couple's engagement on November 27, 2017. Alexi Lubomirski via Getty\n\n\"Meghan had been a part of the London social scene for a while and had slotted into the high society set really easily,\" a \"well-placed source\" told \"E! News.\" \"And so when Harry told Violet he was having trouble finding someone, Violet said she might just have the perfect girl for him.\"\n\nFor months, people have speculated that celebrity stylist Jessica Mulroney, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, or friend Markus Anderson might have introduced the couple. While Violet has not confirmed the rumor yet, it can't hurt to give her a preemptive round of applause for orchestrating this fairy tale ending.\n\n\"We are all just really happy that he finally met a woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with,\" a friend told \"E!.\"\n\nWe feel the same way. To prep for Harry and Meghan's big day in May, brush up on the royal wedding etiquette rules every member of the royal family must follow.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["https://static.businessinsider.com/image/597f908d85754f181202b167-750.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a6b6f32ec1ade70dd4f4234-750-375.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a6b6f32ec1ade70dd4f4235-750-563.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a6b6f32ec1ade70dd4f4234-750-375.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brooke Nelson", "Reader'S Digest"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rd.com/culture/real-story-prince-harry-meghan-markle-met/", "title": "We finally know the identity of the person who introduced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-01-26", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-26", "news_keywords": "Culture, Culture Contributor, Contributor, Reader's Digest, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Royal Wedding", "sailthru.tags": "Culture, Culture Contributor, Contributor, Reader's Digest, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Royal Wedding", "description": "The mysterious matchmaker was revealed to be a mutual friend of the couple and had set the pair up on a blind date in 2016.", "sailthru.description": "The mysterious matchmaker was revealed to be a mutual friend of the couple and had set the pair up on a blind date in 2016.", "title": "We finally know the identity of the person who introduced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.title": "We finally know the identity of the person who introduced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a6b6f32ec1ade70dd4f4234-750-375.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a6b6f32ec1ade70dd4f4233-750-563.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a6b6f32ec1ade70dd4f4233-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "og": {"title": "We finally know the identity of the person who introduced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle", "description": "The mysterious matchmaker was revealed to be a mutual friend of the couple and had set the pair up on a blind date in 2016.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/the-identity-of-who-introduced-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-2018-1", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a6b6f32ec1ade70dd4f4234-750-375.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Reader's Digest", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/the-identity-of-who-introduced-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-2018-1", "title": "We finally know the identity of the person who introduced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle", "description": "The mysterious matchmaker was revealed to be a mutual friend of the couple and had set the pair up on a blind date in 2016.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a6b6f32ec1ade70dd4f4234-750-375.jpg", "site": "@"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "We finally know the identity of the person who introduced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516942800.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
