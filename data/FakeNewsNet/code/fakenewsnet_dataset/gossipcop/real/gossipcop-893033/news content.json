Take as needed.\u201d Prescription note-styled advertisements have popped up across the United States over the past few weeks without much clarification from Em\u2019s team.\n\nFriday, (Nov. 10) Slim Shady posted a hoax infomercial directed at sufferers of AR claiming they will be able to \u201cWalk On Water with Revival.\" Marshall Mathers returns with a Beyonce feature for his first single that will be appearing on the \"Lose Yourself' artist's forthcoming project.\n\nAs the Detroit native\u2019s upcoming album is still without a release date, you\u2019d have to think the 45-year-old will have new music to premiere during his Saturday Night Live performance scheduled for November 18.
