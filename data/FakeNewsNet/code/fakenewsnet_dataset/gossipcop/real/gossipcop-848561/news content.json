On her way to the ParaSnowBall fundraiser at the Hurlingham Club in London Thursday, Pippa stepped out in a dark blue tea-length, sleeveless lace wedding dress. The scoop neck was accented with jewels, and she finished the sophisticated look with cut-out matching sandals.\n\nPippa is set to marry fianc\u00e9 and hedge fund manager James Matthews May 20, and in the two weeks ahead of her wedding, she's reportedly been going hard at the gym. Last week E! News shared a snap of the bride-to-be leaving fitness center and private club KX Gym (her workout gear was pretty damn cute, too). The news site reported that Pippa had attended an hour-and-fifteen-minute Pilates class.\n\nSee More: The 50 Most Beautiful Wedding Cakes Ever\n\nThe bride-to-be is also on a pretty strict diet plan ahead of the big day. According to E!, Pippa adheres to the SirtFood Diet, which includes a seven-day regimen of consuming at least 1,000 calories per day for three days, 1,500 per days for another three days, and juicing throughout the week.\n\nSee More: How to Have a (Kinda) Royal Wedding, Just Like Pippa Middleton\n\nFitness aside, Pippa's been having some fun, too. Earlier this month the bride-to-be hosted her hen party \u2014 that's Brit for bachelorette party \u2014 with sister Kate and few close gals pals. Her entourage enjoyed a weekend of skiing at the French alps, and, of course, received the royal treatment during her stay.\n\n\"Pippa loves skiing so it was her first choice for a hen weekend. They stayed in a really exclusive catered chalet with maids and chef, who ensured that they were totally spoiled,\" a source close to Pippa told The Sun. \"The owners wanted to impress the royal guests so they were given Swatch watches, Ugg slippers, leather-bound notebooks and bespoke fragrances. It was a very small, private party and they had an amazing time.\"\n\nRoyal wedding No. 2 soon come!\n\nThis story originally appeared on Brides.\n\nMore from Brides:\n\n25 Best TV Wedding Dresses of All Time\n\nThe Best Celebrity Engagement Rings Ever\n\nThe Wives and Weddings of Donald Trump\n\nThe Prettiest Wedding Dresses From the Runway", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VHI57yZGeWFxGoOS6r9Dhg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-07-13/66cedad0-4907-11e6-b37a-870ab068282c_64x64-icons_brides.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.1sqM6iXsB3WIVv0y.J28Q--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/brides_832/cd3356a3954a3e0994e77077995b3698", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.Amyve9S7WS5XAEVWz0ZrQ--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/brides_832/cd3356a3954a3e0994e77077995b3698", "https://s.yimg.com/nn/lib/metro/DailyFantasy_BN_Baseball_300x250-min.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.Amyve9S7WS5XAEVWz0ZrQ--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/brides_832/cd3356a3954a3e0994e77077995b3698", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Santana"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/pippa-middleton-spotted-something-blue-180926125.html", "title": "Pippa Middleton Spotted With \"Something Blue\" Dress Two Weeks Ahead of the Wedding", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooLifestyle", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The second royal wedding is almost here!", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.Amyve9S7WS5XAEVWz0ZrQ--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/brides_832/cd3356a3954a3e0994e77077995b3698", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.Amyve9S7WS5XAEVWz0ZrQ--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/brides_832/cd3356a3954a3e0994e77077995b3698"}, "title": "Pippa Middleton Spotted With \"Something Blue\" Dress Two Weeks Ahead of the Wedding"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Lifestyle", "news_keywords": "Pippa Middleton, Hurlingham Club, Wedding Cakes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=6002c820-b5cf-323d-b7b0-316565a64718&src=web", "description": "The second royal wedding is almost here!", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.Amyve9S7WS5XAEVWz0ZrQ--~B/aD0zNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/brides_832/cd3356a3954a3e0994e77077995b3698", "description": "The second royal wedding is almost here!", "title": "Pippa Middleton Spotted With \"Something Blue\" Dress Two Weeks Ahead of the Wedding", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/pippa-middleton-spotted-something-blue-180926125.html"}, "fb": {"app_id": 90376669494, "pages": 828031943896361}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6002c820-b5cf-323d-b7b0-316565a64718&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6002c820-b5cf-323d-b7b0-316565a64718&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494007766.0, "source": "https://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
