News Palermo has revealed how to make the \u2018ugly shoe trend\u2019 work for you, not against you.\n\n\u201cUgly shoes are a mistake women make,\u201d Palermo told the publication. \u201cYou need to make sure the proportion of your shoes are the most flattering for your leg.\u201d\n\nHear that?\n\nEnsure the chucky, clunky, oversized proportions of your \u2018ugly shoes\u2019 work in harmony with your legs.\n\nHow does one do that exactly?\n\nIf you\u2019re petite, stay away from an ugly shoe that climbs above your ankle (no one wants to shorten their legs) and opt for chunky sole or an extra buckle or two instead.\n\nOn the tall side?\n\nEmbrace colour, embellishment and texture \u2013 feathers? Jewelled crocs? Why not.", "images": ["https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/b8f5642cbfc1a70555dafea4b8241cd4", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/0733582fe887cc3cdf079621ad6dc07a", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a08e29c87e55259ddaf8a22759605c2e", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/billie_cover1_web-3.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/06ab05e3d4f2379921c5be1298f3fc58", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0ff5b9d1a28a1a4947801f074ae58d41", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red.svg", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2f1772801d0092cfb79c8dd41ad14255", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3a1f3287f9416b13a8f7a48d97b4dcc9", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2ef0af8160c389861aa08f04e5918296", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a08a8064a8de23a7a38411a6a58c7281", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/535fbe5b176b08a9e76cb703894160f5", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/nav-close.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2953d27c2f54cc587cfdd5c73c34928d", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a58008a7b8cad806252368a231ef1662", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/vogue-au-small.png", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red-mobile.svg", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/google-play.png", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6ea1374f9792d0b60f8c237cc2c16de4", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80bf4d4f4840daab4f18df57aa7ee0a5", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/app-store.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f7aef56bf5aa3e4d4f8138e45413757c", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/476c1deeb0a5368e9d8d478d253c5a6b", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/86c0bf671b4ff92848989ca35bd0258c"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/535fbe5b176b08a9e76cb703894160f5", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lilith", "Hardie Lupica"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com.au/fashion/what-do-i-wear/olivia-palermos-rules-and-warnings-for-wearing-ugly-shoes/news-story/0ab467a2ea80b30f5a0988d55eccc5e4", "title": "Olivia Palermo's rules and warnings for wearing ugly shoes", "meta_data": {"author": "Lilith  Hardie Lupica", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue Australia", "type": "article", "title": "Olivia Palermo's rules and warnings for wearing ugly shoes", "description": "Pretty ugly.", "url": "https://www.vogue.com.au/fashion/what-do-i-wear/olivia-palermos-rules-and-warnings-for-wearing-ugly-shoes/news-story/0ab467a2ea80b30f5a0988d55eccc5e4", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=200", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"creator": {"identifier": "vogueaustralia", "id": "vogueaustralia_id"}, "title": "Olivia Palermo's rules and warnings for wearing ugly shoes", "description": "Pretty ugly.", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=240", "src": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/535fbe5b176b08a9e76cb703894160f5"}, "site": "@wordpressdotcom", "text": {"title": "Olivia Palermo\u2019s rules and warnings for wearing ugly\u00a0shoes"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=270", "theme-color": "#000000", "google-site-verification": "1j07G6Nu2IDJrC-g23wwzTEjb-d0Va1h15olpbRuxYI", "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-15T15:54:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-17T00:31:32+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "application-name": "Vogue Australia", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Vogue - The only source for fashion, style and beauty", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://www.vogue.com.au/feed/;icon-uri=https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505490840.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com.au", "summary": ""}
