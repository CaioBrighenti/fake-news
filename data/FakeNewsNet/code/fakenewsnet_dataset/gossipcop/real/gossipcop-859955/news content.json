Well, it\u2019s probably not rule number one, but moisturizing your skin is just as important as cleansing, whether you drink copious amounts of water, eat your fruits, and exercise\u2014or not. What\u2019s great finding the best skin-saving moisturizer is that everyone pretty much falls into one or more of the following skin-type categories\u2014oily, dry, combination, or normal\u2014and there are a wealth of moisturizing serums and creams that cater to each group. But today, we\u2019re here to talk about oily skin.\n\nBelieve it or not, oily skin needs just as much hydration as normal, dry, and combination skin. \u201cIt's a misconception that people with oily skin do not need to use moisturizers. Stripping the skin of oil can interrupt the skin barrier and cause unwanted irritation. So it\u2019s important to find a moisturizer that does not add additional oil to the skin, but is hydrating,\u201d Dr. Lian Mack, MD, board-certified dermatologist, told ELLE.com. \u201cConsumers should be looking for products that are both oil-free and non-comedogenic (meaning it does not clog pores or cause acne), and that hydrates the skin with water-loving ingredients like hyaluronic acid.\u201d\n\nGood thing lightweight, oil-free moisturizers are just a click away.
