She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day. I don\u2019t know how, like, that got racist on Halloween.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kelly, it was okay for a white person to wear blackface on Halloween, or for a black person to wear whiteface on Halloween when she was a kid, as long as they were dressing up as a character, which de Lesseps had done.\n\nAfter catching backlash over her Halloween costume, LuAnn de Lesseps released an apology to her fans and followers on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI would like to clear the air, I love and respect Diana Ross, this was my tribute to her I was showing my sincere admiration,\u201d she tweeted.\n\n\u201cI in no way altered my skin color and I did not mean to offend anyone,\u201d de Lesseps added.\n\nMegyn Kelly has also since offered an apology to her colleagues for the offensive things she said during her show this week, explaining that she had changed her mind about her thoughts after listening carefully to a number of different views from others.\n\n\u201cI realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong, and I am sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cThe history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent; the wounds too deep.\u201d\n\nOn this morning\u2019s Today show, Kelly\u2019s co-workers, including Al Roker, weighed in on Kelly\u2019s apology, claiming the television host should be saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d to more than just her colleagues.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/34feb98eadd86f8672383a21efe174f9?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rita-Ora-3-300x170.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1472001486461948&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=478801082325642&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/LuAnn-De-Lesseps-Blackface-Not-Racist.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Cronin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5130404/megyn-kelly-doesnt-understand-why-people-thought-luann-de-lesseps-diana-ross-costume-was-considered-racist/", "title": "Megyn Kelly Doesn\u2019t Understand Why People Thought LuAnn De Lesseps\u2019 Diana Ross Costume Was Considered \u2018Racist\u2019", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/ee54ce/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
