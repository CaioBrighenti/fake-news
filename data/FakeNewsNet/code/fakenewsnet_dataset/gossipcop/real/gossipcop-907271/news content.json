I think I cried too.\"\n\nKim regularly posts photos of her older children, North, four, and Saint, two, on Instagram.\n\nBut this is the first snap of the children together on her page since she announced the arrival of Chicago, who was born via a surrogate, on 16 Jan.\n\nIn the photo Kim, who is holding Chicago, poses next to Kanye while North and Saint stand in front of her.\n\nKim previously revealed she had decided to use a surrogate for her third baby after doctors warned of serious health risks if she became pregnant again.\n\nShe said not carrying the child herself was \"so hard\", but that the couple had an instant connection with their daughter.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=newsbeat::news.newsbeat.story.43652288.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:edb80680-fe68-2946-af27-3b64315e1268]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-0.9.1-nojs]&x10=[NEWS_GNL]&x11=[NEWS]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/AA3C/production/_100708534_94f114a0-c7e1-469c-94e4-097715e34382.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AA3C/production/_100708534_94f114a0-c7e1-469c-94e4-097715e34382.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AA3C/production/_100708534_94f114a0-c7e1-469c-94e4-097715e34382.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43652288", "title": "Kim Kardashian shares first photo with all three children", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The reality TV star tells fans the picture was taken \"before all three kids started crying\".", "x-country": "us", "x-audience": "US", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "US", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 118832417, "og": {"title": "Kim K shares first full family picture", "type": "article", "description": "The reality TV star tells fans the picture was taken \"before all three kids started crying\".", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43652288", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AA3C/production/_100708534_94f114a0-c7e1-469c-94e4-097715e34382.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
