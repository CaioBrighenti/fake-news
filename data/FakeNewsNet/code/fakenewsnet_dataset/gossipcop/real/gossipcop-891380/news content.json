I don't have a lump on my head. I never got one headache.\"\n\nWilliams said that she was touched by the support she received from friends and fans of her show.\n\n\"More people were concerned about me than I actually thought that they would be,\" she said, thanking her supporters for the \"flowers and the well wishes.\"\n\nWilliams, who said that she has never missed a day of work in 9 seasons of her hit talk show, said she looks forward to coming into work on Monday. She is also getting ready to celebrate the milestone 1,500th episode of her show on Nov. 13.\n\n\"That's why I got up off the floor and came out here and closed out the show,\" she said. \"You're only as good as your last performance.\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/wendy-williams-1-gty-jt-171102_12x5_992.jpg", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/wendy-williams-2-gty-jt-171102_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/wendy-williams-1-gty-jt-171102_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/amy-robach-wendy-williams-abc-ml-171103_4x3_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/wendy-williams-1-gty-jt-171102_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Catherine Thorbecke"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/felt-middle-fire-wendy-williams-recounts-overheating-fainting/story?id=50897548", "title": "'It felt like I was the middle of a fire': Wendy Williams recounts overheating, fainting, on live TV", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
