{"url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/drake-new-album-scorpion-features-michael-jackson-and-jay-z-1.3547996", "text": "Drake has unveiled his new album Scorpion. The 25-song double album features the singles God\u2019s Plan, Nice for What and I\u2019m Upset, and is currently available to stream and download.\n\nScorpion includes a posthumous appearance from Michael Jackson, with an old recording of the King of Pop summoned from the archives and deployed on the song Don\u2019t Matter To Me. Elsewhere, Talk Up incorporates a verse from Jay-Z, while After Dark features Ty Dolla $ign and Static Major, a singer and producer who died in 2008.\n\nDrake also appears to confirm rumours that he secretly fathered a son. The Toronto star has recently been involved in a feud with rapper Pusha T who last month released The Story of Adidon, a song that accused of Drake fathering and hiding a child.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t hiding my kid from the world,\u201d Drake raps on Emotionless, which features a prominent Mariah Carey sample. \u201cI was hiding the world from my kid.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, March 14 appears to be dedicated to Drake\u2019s son while obliquely covering the circumstances of his birth and his relationship with child\u2019s mother. \u201cShit, we only met two times,\u201d raps Drake on a song that again sees him echo Michael Jackson: \u201cShe not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine.\u201d\n\nHe also appears to address his son directly: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about whose house you live at/ Or who loves you more, or who\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nDrake may have also drawn a line under the beef with Pusha, a feud the Canadian is widely regarded to have lost. \u201cYou know a wise man once said nothin\u2019 at all,\u201d he raps on Emotionless.", "images":
