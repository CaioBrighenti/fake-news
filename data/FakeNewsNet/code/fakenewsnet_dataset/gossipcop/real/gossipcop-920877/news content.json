The TBS late-night host can totally pull off the blockbusters of this former wrestling superstar and current action movie superstar\u2026 or so he believes.\n\nO\u2019Brien wanted to prove to Dwayne Johnson that he has what it takes to become the actor\u2019s stunt double for his latest movie, Rampage. Ignore the fact that they don\u2019t have comparable bodies or the fact that O\u2019Brien still has his luscious locks. Apparently, all it takes is a bald cap and the same jacket-and-pants combo as Johnson.\n\n\u201cI just want to show you I can do it, because I know you question my physicality,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, \u201cbut that was your first mistake and you don\u2019t get a second chance.\u201d\n\nEven though he flubbed that one-liner, even though he lost his bald cap when he was thrown over a table, even though he took a lot of bruises from practicing his stunts, and even though he took way too many punches from a guy in a gorilla costume, O\u2019Brien at least came up with an alternative career.\n\n\u201cI think if you and I made a movie together, we could kill it,\u201d he told Johnson. Cut to pitches for movies titled Zomboni Drift, Pump \u2018N\u2019 Dump, and Troubled Water: The Simon and Garfunkel Story.\n\nWatch the action movie mayhem in the clip above.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/point-blank-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/teamcoco.jpg?crop=0px%2C108px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/crl13120r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hs_237328328923932.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/beyonce-seth-rogen.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/parton-mckeller.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-81692747.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/g3f21.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/varsity-blues.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dwayne-johnson-black-adam.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2a147acd56f71c458ad74777cefaea83?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/j14_promo_stills_022519.0069_r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/wicker-man.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/df-07191_07189_r_v3.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C100px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/betty-gilpin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/freddie-jones.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hbo-max.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/train-to-busan_still-cut-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C148px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nivola.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coon-grace-wolfhard-1-2000x1333.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/conan.jpg?crop=229px%2C313px%2C2288px%2C1202px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/teamcoco.jpg?crop=0px%2C108px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/15/conan-obrien-dwayne-johnson-rampage-stunt-double/", "title": "Conan O'Brien trains to be Dwayne Johnson's Rampage stunt double", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Conan O'Brien,Dwayne Johnson,Last Night on Late Night", "news_keywords": "Conan O'Brien,Dwayne Johnson,Last Night on Late Night", "description": "O'Brien 'Rampage'-d through stunt training.", "og": {"title": "Conan O'Brien trains to be Dwayne Johnson's 'Rampage' stunt double", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/15/conan-obrien-dwayne-johnson-rampage-stunt-double/", "description": "O'Brien 'Rampage'-d through stunt training", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/teamcoco.jpg?crop=0px%2C108px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/15/conan-obrien-dwayne-johnson-rampage-stunt-double/", "description": "O'Brien 'Rampage'-d through stunt training.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/teamcoco.jpg?crop=0px%2C108px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/03/15/conan-obrien-dwayne-johnson-rampage-stunt-double/", "title": "Conan O'Brien trains to be Dwayne Johnson's 'Rampage' stunt double", "description": "O'Brien 'Rampage'-d through stunt training.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/teamcoco.jpg?crop=0px%2C108px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ls3UgZJpvaU"], "publish_date": 1521086400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
