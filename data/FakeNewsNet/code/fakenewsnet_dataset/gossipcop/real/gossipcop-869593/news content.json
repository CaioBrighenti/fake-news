The occasion also happens to mark the film\u2019s twentieth anniversary.\n\n\u201cGangs back together. Now we\u2019re saving icebergs. Go figure,\u201d wrote Zane on Instagram, referencing LDF\u2019s environmental protection work. (Since 2008, the organization has made more than $80 million in grants to environmental causes.)\n\nThe trio famously starred together in the 1997 drama, with Zane playing Cal, the well-off but brutish fianc\u00e9 of Winslet\u2019s character Rose. Of course, Rose ultimately falls for DiCaprio\u2019s character Jack, a passenger in third class.\n\nThis year, lucky bidders will have the chance to win a dinner with DiCaprio and Winslet sometime in October or November at a place of their choosing in New York City.\n\nThe dinner will also benefit a GoFundMe campaign Winslet has been involved with that aims to help a young mother in the U.K. pay for cancer treatment. Winslet cofounded the Golden Hat Foundation, which benefits children with autism and their families, and also supports regional charities in the U.K. and individuals\u2019 fundraising efforts for cancer treatment.\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Top 5 Most Expensive Movies of All Time\n\nThe normally star-studded event will feature a special performance by Lenny Kravitz. In addition, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo will be honored with the foundation\u2019s \u201cNew World Leadership Award\u201d for her \u201cinnovative approach to making Paris a model for sustainable urban living and design,\u201d according to a statement from the gala.\n\nLast year, the charity auction raised a record $45 million and featured guests such as Bono, Chris Rock, Mariah Carey, Tobey Maguire, Jonah Hill, Naomi Campbell, Bradley Cooper and Edward Norton.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kutcher-willis-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C699.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/leonardo.jpg?crop=0px%2C87px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/dicaprio-winslet-1-2000.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1857px%2C975px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/russell-leo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/whenharrymetsally1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/mindy-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/little-women-epk-df-01305_r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-27-at-4.36.50-pm.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2858px%2C1500.45px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tinsley-mortimer1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/celine-dion-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bill-ted-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C248px%2C1814px%2C952px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c1648abf15ab582b95dc580d09b34c5?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/pauly-d-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2177px%2C1142.925px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1157870266-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rhony-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/leonardo-dicaprio-kate-winslet-billy-zane.jpg?crop=188px%2C98px%2C1496px%2C785px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tupac-toc.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/leonardo-dicaprio-kate-winslet-billy-zane.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bieber-split-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/847647228.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C1800px%2C947px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://people.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-465111225.jpg?crop=0px%2C236px%2C2493px%2C1310px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/barbra-streisand.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/leonardo-dicaprio-kate-winslet-billy-zane.jpg?crop=188px%2C98px%2C1496px%2C785px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/titanic-reunion-leonardo-dicaprio-kate-winslet-and-billy-zane-reunite-for-charity-auction/", "title": "Titanic Reunion!
