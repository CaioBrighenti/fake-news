This year, we\u2019ve seen many stars from the hit MTV reality show start or continue growing their families. Lauren Conrad become a first-time mom, Casey Reinhardt is expecting her second baby, and Alex M. has a one-year-old on her hands, while Kristin Cavallari has her hands full with THREE little ones in Nashville, Tennessee. Now, Laguna\u2018s Talan Torriero and his wife Danielle have joined the new-parent squad, as they welcomed a baby boy over the weekend.\n\n\u201cBronson Leonardo Torriero,\u201d Torriero captioned his photos of both mom and dad with baby. \u201cBorn on Oct. 8th, 2017 at 3:26pm and weighing 7.7 pounds. I fell in love with @danielletorriero all over again today.\u201d\n\nHe gave a few additional details to Us Weekly, including the fact that the labor came as a bit of a surprise. \u201cMy wife was scheduled to be induced into labor on Wednesday, October 11, but her water broke last night at 2:30am,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how proud I am of my wife,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe had a tough pregnancy and I am in awe of how well she handled giving birth to our son.\u201d He didn\u2019t provide any additional details on the difficulties she experienced.\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw my son cry and take his first breath in the world, I couldn\u2019t help but tear up just thinking about how beautiful life is,\u201d he continued. \u201cI fell even more in love with my wife today. She is going to make an incredible mother and I can\u2019t wait to get our boy home to start this journey.\u201d\n\nDanielle also shared a pic of the couple with new baby Bronson, calling it the \u201chappiest moment of our lives!!!\u201d\n\nThe new parents have been married since 2014, and recently celebrated their third anniversary. Congrats to the growing family!\n\nWho do you think the next Laguna Beach alum to have a baby will be?
