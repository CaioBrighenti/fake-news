So show your calibre to these detractors or anybody who believes that we, as women, lack the potential to be physically as fit as men by being just that. Not to say that it will be an easy process.\n\n\n\nThe conditioning that we are not at par physically starts early. From the time we are offered a hand to bring down the cookie jar to when we are told not to lift too heavy a weight; when the sports selectors in schools bypass promising girl children or when the male friends refuse to count us in in any serious hiking plans\u2014that feeling of being physically less is ingrained right from the beginning.\n\n\n\nSo how is it that we witness sportswomen like Mary Kom packing a punch in the arena or a badminton champ like PV Sindhu physically pushing herself to the limits? Or the fact that celebs like Jacqueline Fernandez, Taapsee Pannu, Katrina Kaif swear by their fitness routine and are known to train for longer hours than their male counterparts?\n\n\n\nThen again look beyond these superwomen. Look around you. There are regular women storming into male bastions, physically-challenging professions and pursuits, and coming out triumphant. This new-found confidence comes with taking care of yourself, being cognizant of the fact that our body needs to be given TLC, from the right diet and nutrition to exercise and care to help us stand strong.\n\n\n\nThis is when I raise a toast: Here\u2019s to strong women. May we know them, may we be them, may we raise them!", "images": ["https://www.femina.in/images/article-comment-pic01.jpg", "https://www.femina.in/images/sign-in.png", "https://www.femina.in/images/ajax-loader.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036484&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.femina.in/images/tanya-chaitanya.jpg", "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2016/Aug/thumbnail_1470905444.jpg", "https://www.femina.in/images/transparent.gif", "https://www.femina.in/images/femina-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2016/Aug/thumbnail_1470905444.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.femina.in/beauty/skin/easy-diy-natural-toners-to-try-16672.html", "title": "Introducing 3 easy DIY natural toners", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#de0084", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "twitter": {"account_id": 1552217434, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@FeminaIndia", "domain": "femina.in", "creator": "@FeminaIndia", "title": "Introducing 3 easy DIY natural toners", "description": "Keep it natural with these preservative\u2013free toners that are so easy to make at home.", "image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2016/Aug/thumbnail_1470905444.jpg", "url": "https://www.femina.in/beauty/skin/easy-diy-natural-toners-to-try-16672.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 191478637535798, "app_id": 424254827624943}, "keywords": "DIY natural toners, face toners, DIY toners, Home-made toners, DIY facial toners, diy toner for oily skin", "news_keywords": "DIY natural toners, face toners, DIY toners, Home-made toners, DIY facial toners, diy toner for oily skin", "description": "Keep it natural with these preservative\u2013free toners that are so easy to make at home.
