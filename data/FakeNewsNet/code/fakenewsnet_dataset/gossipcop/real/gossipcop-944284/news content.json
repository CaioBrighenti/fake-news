Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still cant believe it. Its a rough world out there people, try to hang on.\"\n\nAnd then this past week, Spade went back to work, addressing the loss further during a stand-up routine in Southern California.\n\n\"Thank you for coming. It was a rough week, but I didn't want to cancel and I appreciate you all coming out here,\" he told the audience, according to E! News. \"And, if my jokes don't work then I get sort of a free pass.\"\n\nRon Galella/WireImage via Getty Images\n\nSpade's brother Andy has also spoken out since Kate's death, saying that her suicide was a complete shock to the family.\n\n\"We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this,\" he told the New York Times. \"It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn\u2019t her. There were personal demons she was battling.\"\n\nAnyone in crisis, or who knows someone in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741-741.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/david-spade-kate-spade-2-gty-jt-180610_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/kate-david-spade2-gty-ml-180606_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/david-spade-kate-spade-2-gty-jt-180610_hpMain_12x5_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/david-spade-kate-spade-2-gty-jt-180610_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/david-spade-donates-100000-mental-health-organization-kates-55893227", "title": "David Spade donates $100,000 to mental health organization following Kate's death", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "One week after his sister-in-law's death, David Spade has donated $100,000 to help those affected by mental illness.", "keywords": "david spade, kate spade, movies, laws, mental health, Kate Spade, David Spade, social media, mass media, death,good morning america, morning news, robin roberts, lara spencer, josh eliott, sam champion, gma", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "David Spade donates $100,000 to mental health organization following Kate's death", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "David Spade donates $100,000 to mental health organization following Kate's death", "description": "One week after his sister-in-law's death, David Spade has donated $100,000 to help those affected by mental illness.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/david-spade-donates-100000-mental-health-organization-kates/story?id=55893227", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/david-spade-kate-spade-2-gty-jt-180610_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "david spade, kate spade, movies, laws, mental health, Kate Spade, David Spade, social media, mass media, death", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "David Spade donates $100,000 to mental health organization following Kate's death", "description": "One week after his sister-in-law's death, David Spade has donated $100,000 to help those affected by mental illness.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/david-spade-donates-100000-mental-health-organization-kates/story?id=55893227", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/david-spade-kate-spade-2-gty-jt-180610_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,55893227", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,55893227", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/david-spade-donates-100000-mental-health-organization-kates/story?id=55893227"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,55893227", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,55893227", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/david-spade-donates-100000-mental-health-organization-kates/story?id=55893227", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/david-spade-donates-100000-mental-health-organization-kates/story?id=55893227"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
