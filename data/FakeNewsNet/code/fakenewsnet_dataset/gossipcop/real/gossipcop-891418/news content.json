And on Thursday, lingerie model Sarah Stage showed off her post-pregnancy weight just two weeks after the birth to her second child.\n\nThe 33-year-old social media star stepped on the scale in a photo for her Instagram Story captured by E!, showing that she was down to 124.8 pounds. \u201cGoing to keep on sticking to my nutrition guide,\u201d she wrote on the picture.\n\nIt was the first time Stage had weighed herself since in the arrival of son Logan Alexander, who was born via c-section on Oct. 16. He weighed-in at 7 lbs. and 2 oz., and was 19 inches long.\n\nWhile Stage didn\u2019t reveal the final amount of weight she had ultimately gained during her pregnancy, she had previously shared in August (when she was 8 months pregnant) that she had only gained 18 pounds.\n\nStage said Friday that her followers had been asking her on social media about her post-pregnancy weight loss, E! reported.\n\nThe mother of two, who shares Logan Alexander and 2 \u00bd-year-old big brother James Hunter with husband Kris Jason, has faced criticism for her small belly during both pregnancies.\n\nImage zoom Sarah Stage at 9 months pregnant Sarah Stage/Instagram\n\nRELATED: Model Sarah Stage Keeps Up Her Workouts as She Hits Her 9th Month of Pregnancy\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve announced my second pregnancy, I\u2019ve had certain \u2018Instagram medical experts\u2019 tell me what I should and shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d she wrote in a September post while taking on the critics. \u201cAnd while I find some of the comments hilarious, I choose to only listen to my OB/GYN and of course I also listen to MY body. If something feels off, I don\u2019t do it! I always do what\u2019s best for my growing baby and put him first!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a proven medical fact that continuing exercising while pregnant has many health benefits for you and baby,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are also some people who assume that since I am exercising while pregnant, that I\u2019m obsessed with how I \u2018look\u2019 but in fact I\u2019m obsessed with maintaining a healthy lifestyle that will give my baby and myself the best possible quality of life.\u201d\n\nAs she continues to recover from her c-section, Stage is resting at home with her family.\n\n\u201cEnjoying this newborn phase,\u201d she wrote on Instagram Oct. 30. \u201cIt\u2019s true what everyone says that it goes by so fast. It\u2019s been nice resting, healing and cuddling with the babes. Still recovering from c section and continuing to take it easy at home. My goal is to make it all the way through trick or treating tomorrow with the family #csectionrecovery #2weeksold #momlife #2under3Club.\u201d\n\nShe stayed true to her promise, dressing up the next day as Star Wars characters for the big day.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/beyonce-blue-ivy-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C326px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630",
