You may be relieved to finally know what is causing your symptoms. You may also have feelings of sadness, fear, confusion, and anger. Some people who have lupus have bouts of depression because of the challenges of living with this disease. Learning all you can about your illness can help you better cope with your symptoms, prevent flares, and deal with side effects and complications.\n\nLupus can affect and damage different parts of your body.\n\nKidneys\n\nYour kidneys get rid of waste and other toxins from the body. Lupus can affect the kidneys and cause the structures that filter the blood to swell. Without treatment, lupus can lead to permanent kidney damage. If lupus affects your kidneys, you will probably need medicine to prevent serious damage. The most common symptom of kidney problems is swelling in your feet, legs, hands, or eyelids.\n\nHeart\n\nLupus can inflame the sac around your heart and cause chest pain. Though less common, but more serious, it can harden the walls of your coronary arteries. This can lead to angina (chest pain) and an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Lupus can also cause inflammation of the heart itself, which can lead to scarring and possible heart failure.\n\nLungs\n\nInflammation can also occur in the lining of your lungs. This can cause chest pain, which is often felt with deep breathing. People who have lupus are at risk of getting pneumonia.\n\nJoints\n\nMost people who have lupus have swollen and painful joints. These symptoms can come and go, and may affect several joints at once. Usually, there is no long-term damage.\n\nSkin\n\nPeople who have lupus often get a butterfly-shaped, red rash across their nose and cheeks. This is called a malar rash. Other parts of the skin may be affected. You could have raised bumps or dry patches, often on areas that are exposed to the sun. You could get sores inside your mouth or nose. Hair loss (alopecia) is common during flares. You may notice a blotchy purple color on your hands, fingers, or toes. This happens when blood does not flow well to the skin\u2019s surface. It is called Raynaud\u2019s Disease.\n\nCentral Nervous System\n\nLupus can affect your brain and the nerves in your spinal cord. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, mild confusion or memory problems, vision problems, and changes in your mood. It can lead to more serious health issues, such as seizures or a stroke.\n\nBlood\n\nLupus can cause the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets to decrease. Fewer red blood cells can lead to anemia, which is common in people who have lupus. White blood cells help the body fight infection. Rarely, do white blood cells get low enough to cause infection. Platelets help your blood to clot. A low platelet count can lead to easy bruising, nosebleeds, and other bleeding. It can also cause your blood to clot too easily or in unneeded places. If the blood clot breaks away and travels through the bloodstream, it can block blood vessels and cause serious problems, such as a stroke, blood clots in the lungs (thrombosis), or repeated miscarriages.", "images": ["https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/admin-logo.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/shutterstock_130170572-220x150.jpg", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/icon-divider.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/38679390_l-705x536.jpg", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/aafp-e1520870301332.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/38679390_l-1024x779.jpg", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/logo-2.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/symptom-checker-img.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/chevron.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=249633735563230&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/arrow-up.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/icon-search-orange.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/aafp-logo.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/30641310_l-220x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=297209990620305&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/aafp-foundation-e1520869366904.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/arrow-down.png", "https://erygi42lxye3x93s11zt8kf1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/icon-print.png", "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/themes/familydoctor-child/images/logo-mobile.png"], "top_img": "https://familydoctor.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/38679390_l-1024x779.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Familydoctor.Org Editorial Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://familydoctor.org/condition/lupus/", "title": "What Is Lupus? - Symptoms and Treatment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "familydoctor.org", "type": "article", "author": "familydoctor.org editorial staff", "keywords": "azathioprine,butterfly-shaped rash,cutaneous lupus erythematosus,cyclophosphamide,Discoid lupus erythematosus,Drug-induced lupus,fatigue,fever,hair loss,headache,immune system,kidney problems,low blood count,memory problems,mouth ulcers,Neonatal lupus,pain,rash,Raynaud's disease,Systemic lupus erythematosus", "description": "Lupus is a disease that affects your immune system.
