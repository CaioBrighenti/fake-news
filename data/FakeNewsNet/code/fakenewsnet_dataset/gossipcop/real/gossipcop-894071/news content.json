The announcement came November 15, 2017 - the same day as You're the Worst season 4's finale\n\n\n\nFX co-President of Original programming Nick Grad said in a statement:\n\n\n\n\u201cStephen Falk has been an extraordinary creative partner to work with over the past four years, and it is in that spirit that we came to the mutual decision to end You\u2019re the Worst with its fifth season. Stephen\u2019s singular vision for the series has been its guiding force from the start and our decision, while difficult, will allow the series to end on its own terms and in a way most satisfying to its devoted fans. We want to thank Stephen, the cast and the crew for everything they\u2019ve done to make You\u2019re the Worst one of the best comedies on TV.\u201d\n\n\n\nfurther reading: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Season 14 Release Date\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be a bit early to eulogoize You're the Worst but while we have the time, Gad is right: this was one of the better comedies on TV. What initially seemed to be a comedy about shitty people falling into something approximating love, You're the Worst evolved into a sophisticated exploration of mental illness, self-destruction, and general human imperfection.\n\n\n\nChris Geere and Aya Cash excelled as star-crossed lovers Jimmy and Gretchen and Desmin Borges, Kether Donohue, and Janet Varney round out the cast as Angelenos all damaged in their own way.\n\n\n\n\u201cMaking You\u2019re The Worst has been an incredible experience and FX Networks have been dream partners,\u201d creator Stephen Falk said. \u201cI am thankful to have the opportunity to be thoroughly judged whether or not we \u2018stick the landing\u2019 -- which is a thing people say now that stupid Breaking Bad had to end so damn perfectly.\u201d\n\n\n\nfurther reading: Archer Season 10 Will Be Influenced by Alien\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know what that means.
