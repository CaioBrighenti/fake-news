In the months that followed the incident, the star later denounced the hack as a 'sex crime' and a 'flagrant violation of privacy'.\n\nNow, in a new interview with Scott Feinberg on The Hollywood Reporter's Awards Chatter Podcast, the actress has opened up further about the leak, admitting she still hasn't come to terms with what happened.\n\n'When the hacking thing happened\u2014it was so unbelievably violating that you can't even put into words. I think that I am still actually processing,' she explained.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'I feel like I got gangbanged by the f*cking planet. There was not one person in the world that is not capable of seeing these intimate photos of me.'\n\n'You could just be at a barbecue and someone could just pull it up on their phone.'\n\nThe Hunger Games star revealed that several women had contacted her about bringing a lawsuit against technology company Apple which later revealed hackers hadn't penetrated its systems, as was widely believed, rather targeted 'names, passwords and security questions'.\n\nI think that I am still actually processing\n\nDespite the leak, the star decided not to sue the tech giant.\n\n'None of that was going to bring me peace and none of that was going to bring my nude body back to me and Nick [Holt], the person they were intended for,' she explained.\n\nJennifer Lawrence and then-boyfriend Nicholas Holt | ELLE UK Getty Images\n\nOpening up about the gross invasion of privacy, which earlier this year saw Chicago hacker Edward Majerczyk sentenced to nine months in prison, Lawrence admitted that even a year-and-a-half after the leak, she still felt the effects of being exposed to the world.\n\nDuring the interview, she recalled a time when someone came up to her following the incident and described her as a role model for young women, forcing her to run to the toilets and burst into tears.\n\n'I feel like I got gangbanged by the f*cking planet\n\n'I felt like an impostor or I felt like I can't believe someone still feels that way,' she admitted.\n\nTouching on the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault and harassment scandal which came to light last month, the star described the film producer as a 'paternal' figure in her career.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'Then with Harvey Weinstein, it was bizarre. I heard that he was a dog but he was always almost paternal to me,' she shared.\n\n'He was never inappropriate with me. I thought we had a nice relationship where when he acted like an asshole, I called him an asshole. I actually think the word I used was a sadistic monster, but it was just never of that nature so that was really shocking.'\n\nWhen he acted like an asshole, I called him an asshole\n\nWhile several A-listers including the likes of Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman and Angelina Jolie have spoken up about the sexual misconduct they've endured during their careers, the Californian star admitted: 'I have never had a man use his power to sexually abuse me.'\n\nHowever, last month the star revealed she was once described as 'too fat' for a film role by an unnamed female and instructed to lose 15 pounds in two weeks for a role.\n\n'I took care of everything on my own. Trust me, they were handled,' she explained.\n\nYes, Jennifer!", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/37/4000x2000/landscape-1505667622-gettyimages-848429352.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/2560x1286/1511253772-maria-alyokhina-1511183309.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/42/2560x1280/1508227446-jennifer-lawrence-1508219336.jpg?resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/42/2560x1280/1508227446-jennifer-lawrence-1508219336.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40104/jennifer-lawrence-why-she-didnt-sue-nude-photo-leak-scandal/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Explains Why She Didn't Sue Over Nude Photo Leak Scandal", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Explains Why She Didn't Sue Over Nude Photo Leak Scandal", "description": "'You could just be at a barbecue and someone could just pull it up on their phone'", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40104/jennifer-lawrence-why-she-didnt-sue-nude-photo-leak-scandal/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/42/2560x1280/1508227446-jennifer-lawrence-1508219336.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-01 08:20:22", "published_time": "2017-11-21 10:26:49", "section": "Culture"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/42/2560x1280/1508227446-jennifer-lawrence-1508219336.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Explains Why She Didn't Sue Over Nude Photo Leak Scandal", "description": "The 27-year-old has opened up about how she felt following her nude photo hacking in 2013.", "keywords": "Jennifer Lawrence, Nude Photo Leak Scandal, Jennifer Lawrence actress, Jennifer Lawrence boyfriend, Jennifer Lawrence relationship, Jennifer Lawrence and Harvey Weinstein", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/42/2048x2040/1508227446-jennifer-lawrence-1508219336.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,jennifer lawrence", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-21T10:26:49Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/42/2560x1280/1508227446-jennifer-lawrence-1508219336.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/42/2048x2040/1508227446-jennifer-lawrence-1508219336.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Jennifer Lawrence Explains Why She Didn't Sue Over Nude Photo Leak Scandal", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511278009.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
