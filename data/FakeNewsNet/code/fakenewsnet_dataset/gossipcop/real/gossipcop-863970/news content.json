Unless you just so happen to be Lauren Conrad, that is. The 31-year-old mommy-to-be has a new go-to that she\u2019s wild about, and it\u2019s actually (gasp!) under $10.\n\nWhen it comes time to hit the beach, LC says it\u2019s Alba Botanica Hawaiian Sunscreen With SPF 45 ($9) that she\u2019s lathering up with. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge pump of it in my bathroom,\u201d she told Well & Good.\n\nIt\u2019s a wise choice for the pregnant reality alum, as not only is its green tea and aloe inclusive formula 100 percent vegetarian, but it\u2019s lightweight, stays water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, and reportedly dries in a flash. Those that care about the environment (read: all of us) will also be pleased to know that it\u2019s biodegradable and free of animal testing.\n\nIn short? It\u2019s the perfect product for those carefree beach days (like today), when you\u2019re hanging poolside in a bandeau (Conrad\u2019s fave, since it won\u2019t give you tan lines) and a caftan, LC-style. \u201cThere\u2019s just something glamorous about a lightweight caftan,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nLooking good, mamma!\n\nWhat\u2019s your sunblock go-to?
