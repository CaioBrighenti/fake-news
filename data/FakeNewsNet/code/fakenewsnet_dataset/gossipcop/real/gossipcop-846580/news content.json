From my family, my wife, my kids, my friends, basically my life.\n\n\"I also realized that had been the last 10 years. At that moment I wanted to quit, and almost did.\"\n\nThe Grammy Award winner says that the pressure to release albums was making him ill and wants to change the way OneRepublic releases music from now on.\n\n\"I had the idea even before our last album of releasing \"songs\"... when we want, as often as we want, however we want. Not albums, songs.\n\n\"It's always frustrated me that by the time u get to a 3rd, 4th or 5th single off an album that song may have been produced 2-3 years ago....and sounds dated.\n\n\"Albums aren't built to be flexible or get out of their own way. Starting tomorrow we will be dropping new music as often as humanly possible...\"\n\nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat", "images": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/cpsprodpb/11B0/production/_89782540_dogtoyfight.jpg", "http://news.files.bbci.co.uk/newsbeat/newsbeat-composition/313/sprites/BBC_Newsbeat_Small.gif", "http://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "http://news.files.bbci.co.uk/newsbeat/newsbeat-composition/313/sprites/BBC_Newsbeat_Large.gif", "https://sa.bbc.co.uk/bbc/bbc/s?name=frameworks.barlesque.orb.webservice.json.page&ml_name=webmodule&ml_version=-1&blq_js_enabled=0&blq_s=4d&blq_r=2.7&blq_v=default&blq_e=pal&pal_route=webserviceapi&app_type=responsive&language=en-GB&pal_webapp=barlesque&prod_name=frameworks&app_name=frameworks", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/mcs/media/images/53670000/jpg/_53670292_miss_elliot.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/16974/production/_95823529_gettyimages-621446962.jpg", "http://static.bbci.co.uk/frameworks/barlesque/5.0.0/orb/4/img/orb-search-dark.png", "http://static.bbci.co.uk/frameworks/barlesque/5.0.0/orb/4/img/bbc-blocks-dark.png", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DAF4/production/_95825065_gettyimages-487438528.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/cpsprodpb/10890/production/_97782776_gettyimages-844373656.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/cpsprodpb/3301/production/_85975031_selena.jpg", "http://stats.bbc.co.uk/o.gif?~RS~s~RS~News~RS~t~RS~HighWeb_Story~RS~i~RS~39744311~RS~p~RS~102337~RS~a~RS~Domestic~RS~u~RS~/newsbeat/39744311~RS~r~RS~0~RS~q~RS~0~RS~z~RS~5139~RS~", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/cpsprodpb/AA35/production/_83937534_gettyimages-470374415.jpg"], "top_img": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DAF4/production/_95825065_gettyimages-487438528.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder was 'on verge of a mental breakdown' after anxiety battle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 100004154058350}, "description": "Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.", "theme-color": "#000", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=999362879", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "BBC Newsbeat", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BBCNewsbeat", "creator": "@BBCNews", "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder was 'on verge of a mental breakdown' after anxiety battle", "description": "Ryan Tedder from OneRepublic says he was \"on the verge of a mental breakdown\" after spending 200 days on the road last year.", "image": {"src": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DAF4/production/_95825065_gettyimages-487438528.jpg"}}, "og": {"title": "OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder was 'on verge of a mental breakdown' after anxiety battle", "type": "article", "description": "Ryan Tedder from OneRepublic says he was \"on the verge of a mental breakdown\" after spending 200 days on the road last year.", "image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/DAF4/production/_95825065_gettyimages-487438528.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.bbc.co.uk", "summary": ""}
