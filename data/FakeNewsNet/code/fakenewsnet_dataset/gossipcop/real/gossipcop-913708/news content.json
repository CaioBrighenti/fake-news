If you ask Netflix, a reported $300 million.\n\nThe lauded Emmy, Golden Globe, and Peabody Award-winning producer, director, writer, and showrunner has been behind critically acclaimed series like FX's American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson, Feud, and American Horror Story, as well as Fox's Glee. Despite his success at 20th Century Fox, Murphy has inked a staggering overall deal with Netflix, which one insider told Deadline is \"the deal of a lifetime for an artist of a lifetime.\"\n\nBeginning July 1, Murphy and his Ryan Murphy Productions will begin producing both TV shows and films exclusively at Netflix, similar to the deal Shonda Rhimes struck six months ago with the streaming giant after leaving ABC. Like Rhimes, Murphy's move from his longtime home at Fox likely won't affect his hit shows there. Even his upcoming drama Pose, which is still in production with FX, will continue on with the network and be overseen by Murphy for as long as it's on the air. Murphy touched on his future, as well as his scrappy past, in a statement after the Netflix deal was announced:\n\n\"The history of this moment is not lost on me. I am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 dollars in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me. I am awash in genuine appreciation for Ted Sarandos, Reed Hastings, and Cindy Holland at Netflix for believing in me and the future of my company which will continue to champion women, minorities, and LGBTQ heroes and heroines, and I am honored and grateful to continue my partnership with my friends and peers at Fox on our existing shows.\"\n\nIn other words, you don't need to worry about your favorite Murphy show vanishing from Fox or FX anytime soon. In addition to Pose, American Crime Story is in the midst of its second season, with another on the way. American Horror Story also has at least one more season to go, as does Feud. On Fox, the Murphy-produced 9-1-1 \u2014 a medical drama about first responders starring Connie Britton, Peter Krause, and Angela Bassett \u2014 was recently renewed for season two, as well.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFortunately it sounds like Murphy will still be around to guide those shows as they move forward, even as he starts branching out with his Netflix projects. The first of those will be an origin story about Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest starring his muse, Sarah Paulson. The other series is titled The Politician, and already has a jaw-dropping cast lined up: Ben Platt, Barbra Streisand, and Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nPer usual, we can't wait to see what Murphy does next.", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/F515MYw4yreuQ7_gSRrvQvGycGo/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/02/06/954/n/1922283/5cb509115c5b577066d765.45806567_/i/American-Horror-Story-Season-9-Cast.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=258101201039378&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/UGBtvxt7ngy8yHJhA6wQKTTZFls/150x150/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:sharpen-!1,0,true!-/2019/06/22/048/n/44344577/57edc0755d0ec32824acf2.59046655_4010A5DA-15BC-4BC1-A538-89DA8CD9A50A/i/Quinn-Keaney-avatar.jpeg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/AA6nr8SYwgoHIaIwn7bgyZIqlQU/0x0:3318x3318/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/07/10/703/n/1922283/fdeb6d065d2609d0b130c7.80459982_/i/Hasbro-Stranger-Things-Monopoly.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/5MtRQUR0D8FQ2zDQ17KlpDtcgF8/405x4:1348x947/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/07/10/740/n/24155406/0f0c55225d261682961912.14308453_/i/Otherhood-Netflix-Original-Movie-Trailer.png", "https://www.popsugar.com/static/ck.php?nids[]=44583558&p=&u=0", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4sLizCgrCh7GSaW3BFag0IpghQ0/1343x0:4343x3000/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/07/09/687/n/1922283/2db426775d24b30c93b279.31590817_/i/Stranger-Things-Season-3-Records.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/v4361/themes/onsugar_themes/lightspeed/imgs/push_notification_icon.png", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/QkKMRyfg61azVSpmfetai-RpZAw/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/02/14/675/n/1922283/tmp_cl0LNJ_713c5c0c16ad251f_GettyImages-646912298.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/DQLIbKTdX6kcFsYHLhZDh8_4UYw/664x0:2664x2000/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/07/10/704/n/1922283/3ef5f4ff5d260a3d22b3e6.72774763_/i/Stranger-Things-Season-4-Details.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/sXWuobEOugkS0UecRjCwCAu0ZPI/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/07/10/657/n/1922153/fe78da5b3f1f433e_GettyImages-1154659050/i/Emma-Roberts-Haircut-Color-American-Horror-Story.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/docs/exit_celebrity.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035900&c3=&c4=www.popsugar.com%2Fentertainment%2FWhat-Happens-Ryan-Murphy-Shows-FX-44583558&c5=&c6=&c15=bfed15d2b204ec98ea31a94ddb4a81c6&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=1", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/v4361/static/imgs/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_135x40.svg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Op2QPaqyHEllSn6R7bAIlc-2oXs/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:fill-!white!-/2018/02/14/690/n/1922283/de84b6745a8456d184f988.46802856_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_17268548_1518620926.jpg", "https://ts.popsugar.com/b/ss/popsugarglobalprod/1/H.26--NS/?v1=buzz%3Aus:nojs", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/7L5ME0--siGT8Tl8qgJWLG7bySE/550x0:4070x3520/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/07/09/924/n/1922283/351d5f725d250305d95ec1.15626545_/i/David-Harbour-Instagram-Hints-About-Jim-Hopper-Fate.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Op2QPaqyHEllSn6R7bAIlc-2oXs/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:fill-!white!-/2018/02/14/690/n/1922283/de84b6745a8456d184f988.46802856_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_17268548_1518620926.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Quinn Keaney"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/What-Happens-Ryan-Murphy-Shows-FX-44583558", "title": "What Happens to Ryan Murphy's Shows on FX?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1120, maximum-scale=1.0", "article": {"author": "Quinn Keaney", "published_time": "2018-02-17T17:20:20-08:00"}, "author": "Quinn Keaney", "description": "Just how much is Ryan Murphy's creativity worth?
