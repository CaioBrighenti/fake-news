Indications of an issue between the costars emerged in a since-deleted comment by Gibson on one of Johnson\u2019s recent Instagram posts.\n\n\u201cIf you move forward with that #Hobbs Movie you will have purposely ignored the heart to heart moment we had in my sprinter,\u201d Gibson wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna hear from you until you remember what we talked about. I\u2019m on your timeline cause you\u2019re not responding to my text messages \u2013 #FastFamily is just that a family\u2026\u2026.. We don\u2019t fly solo.\u201d\n\nHis campaign to reach Johnson didn\u2019t end there. Gibson, who has starred in five of the eight Fast films as the smooth-talking Roman Pearce, was back at it Tuesday with another since-deleted Instagram plea.\n\n\u201cI have never and will never have a problem with this major movie star he\u2019s my brother,\u201d wrote Gibson, who didn\u2019t help his case by admitting he didn\u2019t like Baywatch. \u201cI\u2019m simply trying to reach him cause he won\u2019t call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie I want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 release date has already been announced and we can\u2019t let our loyal fans #FastFamily or our loyal fast and furious FANS down on any level from pushing the date\u2026\u2026.. Didn\u2019t you see how HUGE #Fast8 was? It\u2019s because we announced and KEPT our release date bro.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI never ever go public with private family issues,\u201d perhaps referencing Johnson previously going public with his own issues. \u201cWe do this on behalf of the families, the cast, the crew member who have been down and loyal to us for 15 years\u2026\u2026 Everyone matters\u2026. When we shoot we all eat, we we show up as a FAMILY display our love, our funny stuff, our story lines and HEARTS in every frame\u2026\u2026 Me and the cast laugh because it seems like #Fast is like a HOLIDAY at this point\u2026.. You [can\u2019t] push the release date of a holiday bro.\u201d\n\nGibson concluded, \u201cThis is not a #Rant I\u2019m no Rock #Hater and I don\u2019t want this #Life I love my own\u2026 I\u2019m doing this for the #FastFamily I\u2019m loyal and I apologize for being loyal but dammit I am.\u201d\n\nNow, in the second post, the Transformers alum did say, \u201cOnce you hit me back I will delete every post,\u201d which might mean that he has finally received a response from Johnson. But yet to be deleted from Gibson\u2019s Instagram feed is a picture of him and Johnson with the caption, \u201cI don\u2019t do email bruh. You got my cell same San Diego # hit me.\u201d\n\nReps for Gibson and Johnson did not immediately respond to EW\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOn the way to becoming a billion-dollar franchise, Fast & Furious has had to weather it\u2019s fair share of drama. The most high-profile case came to a head last year when Johnson referred to some of his unnamed male costars as \u201ccandy asses.\u201d All indications are this was a shot at Diesel, who has attempted to downplay any feud. But the fact that the duo are never spotted in the same frame during Fate of the Furious hasn\u2019t help dispel the rumors.\n\nAnd more recently, female lead Michelle Rodriguez threatened to leave if they didn\u2019t \u201cshow love to the women\u201d in the next film. She has, however, acknowledged that Diesel will most likely \u201cconvince\u201d her to return.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/episode-ix.jpg?crop=0px%2C174px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-468305280.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/gettyimages-1077671528.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/otherhood.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C3000px%2C1577px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/crl13120r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/fast-9-casting.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/mcdfaan_ec195.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/harry-met-sally-4-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C305px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/g3f21.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dwayne-johnson-black-adam.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5ef8613926fe5ac5d5623868eca6ee9f?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ff6.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/scary-stories.jpg?crop=328px%2C0px%2C2343px%2C1230.075px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/red-notice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hobbs-shaw.jpg?crop=319px%2C0px%2C2362px%2C1240.05px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/df-07191_07189_r_v3.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hs-ie_2727823823923.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2400px%2C1260px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/betty-gilpin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/michell-rodriguez-fast-and-furious-6.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coon-grace-wolfhard-1-2000x1333.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1080026318.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/df-02039_r.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-468305280.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Derek Lawrence"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/09/12/tyrese-dwayne-johnson-fast-9-drama-instagram/", "title": "Tyrese uses Instagram to beg Dwayne Johnson not to delay Fast 9", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Tyrese, Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, Rock, Fast & Furious, Instagram, Tyrese Gibson, Vin Diesel", "news_keywords": "Tyrese, Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, Rock, Fast & Furious, Instagram, Tyrese Gibson, Vin Diesel", "description": "Saying his texts aren't being returned, Gibson reached out to his costar via Instagram", "og": {"title": "Tyrese Uses Instagram to Beg Dwayne Johnson Not to Delay 'Fast 9'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/09/12/tyrese-dwayne-johnson-fast-9-drama-instagram/", "description": "2 Fast 2 Much Drama", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-468305280.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/09/12/tyrese-dwayne-johnson-fast-9-drama-instagram/", "description": "Saying his texts aren't being returned, Gibson reached out to his costar via Instagram", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-468305280.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/09/12/tyrese-dwayne-johnson-fast-9-drama-instagram/", "title": "Tyrese Uses Instagram to Beg Dwayne Johnson Not to Delay 'Fast 9'", "description": "Saying his texts aren't being returned, Gibson reached out to his costar via Instagram", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-468305280.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505188800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
