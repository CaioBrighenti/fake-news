Davidson's father, New York firefighter Scott Davidson, died while trying to rescue victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center. His badge number, 8418, is displayed front and center on the necklace.\n\n\"\ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udf0c\ud83c\udf03\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8d\u2601\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udddd,\" Davidson captioned an image of Grande wearing the precious gift, before jumping in again to defend his decision to give Grande the pendant.\n\n\"No girl should ever wear your dad's chain. So disrespectful,\" one follower wrote.\n\n\"For ur information that's not just some girl, that's my fianc\u00e9,\" Davidson responded. \"She's the greatest person I know. I gave it to her because she has my heart and that is the most precious thing I own. My dad would be so happy and love her so much.\"\n\nGrande, meanwhile, commented on the pic, \"I love u more than anything.\"\n\nDavidson has had his father's badge number tattooed on his left arm for years, while fans noticed a couple weeks ago that Grande had gotten the number inked on her foot.\n\nThe SNL star made his love for Grande official when he debuted not one, but two tattoos in tribute to his lady love in early June, just weeks after they started dating. Davidson got inked with a neck tattoo of a black bunny mask, similar to the one worn by Grande on the cover of her Dangerous Woman album, and a thumb tat of her initials, \"AG.\"\n\nGrande, meanwhile, appears to have his name tattooed on her finger.\n\nSee more on Davidson and Grande's romance in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nPete Davidson Gives an Enthusiastic Review of Fiancee Ariana Grande's Sexy New Song 'God Is a Woman'\n\nAriana Grande Revisits Sweet \u2018SNL\u2019 Moment With Pete Davidson\n\nAriana Grande Has a New Tattoo Dedicated to Pete Davidson's Late Father\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-06/pete_davidson_ariana_grande_2pic_gettyimages_0.jpg?itok=TiATHC6B&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-06/pete_davidson_ariana_grande_2pic_gettyimages_0.jpg?itok=S2Q9lteD", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2019-06/1280bella_1.jpg?itok=VXP3W6NZ&h=36387a1d", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x169/public/images/2018-06/pete_1.jpg?itok=phuyhUmt&h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-06/pete_davidson_ariana_grande_2pic_gettyimages_0.jpg?itok=S2Q9lteD", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/pete-davidson-gives-ariana-grande-his-pendant-of-late-fathers-fdny-badge-106031", "title": "Pete Davidson Gives His Pendant of Late Father's FDNY Badge to Ariana Grande", "meta_data": {"title": "Pete Davidson Gives His Pendant of Late Father's FDNY Badge to Ariana Grande | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/pete-davidson-gives-ariana-grande-his-pendant-of-late-fathers-fdny-badge-106031", "title": "Pete Davidson Gives His Pendant of Late Father's FDNY Badge to Ariana Grande", "description": "The 'SNL' star defended his decision to give Grande the pendant on Instagram.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-06/pete_davidson_ariana_grande_2pic_gettyimages_0.jpg?itok=S2Q9lteD", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 'SNL' star defended his decision to give Grande the pendant on Instagram.", "title": "Pete Davidson Gives His Pendant of Late Father's FDNY Badge to Ariana Grande", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/pete-davidson-gives-ariana-grande-his-pendant-of-late-fathers-fdny-badge-106031", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-06/pete_davidson_ariana_grande_2pic_gettyimages_0.jpg?itok=S2Q9lteD"}, "description": "The 'SNL' star defended his decision to give Grande the pendant on Instagram.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Pete Davidson, Ariana Grande", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Pete Davidson, Ariana Grande"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
