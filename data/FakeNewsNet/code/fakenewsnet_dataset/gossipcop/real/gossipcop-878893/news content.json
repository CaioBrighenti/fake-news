The HGTV personality\u2014one half of the team behind Flip or Flop with ex-husband Tarek El Moussa\u2014recently dished to E! on a few tips she has for fans going through a breakup. Since she's now an expert in the area, having split with her husband just this year, El Moussa pointed to some essential elements of every home that need to be switched up post-split. Case in point: photos. \u201cBegin with replacing the pictures of your ex around the house with photos of your kids or memories with friends,\u201d she suggested. \u201cYou can even shop for beautiful new frames to make the process more fun and design-friendly.\u201d\n\nOther tips include replacing the bed, revamping the wall art, and even repainting the entirety of the home to bring a new \u201cgood energy\u201d to the environment. Christina and Tarek previously shared a seven-bedroom, nine-bath home in Yorba Linda, California. The couple initially went with an earthy palette of beiges and browns for their home, but switched to a sleek black, white, and gray palette halfway through\u2014in every room, that is, except for the pool room, which retained the rustic feel. \u201cIt\u2019s different from the rest of the house, but it works because it\u2019s a man\u2019s room,\u201d Christina said. \u201cI don\u2019t use this room!\u201d", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0d0c47bc914930a51a1dd5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/07_Image%2520Studio_VARA-Palo_Alto_1-1867.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59b82d04ad74eb2d80e3ef6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-605939740.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-reverse.13d6d4955ed232771a3c921b77513eaddd3ac58b.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d2397492124fc00097f54e0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/05_Post%2520Houston_O%2520atrium_OMA%26Luxigon.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-header.4beb0fb9c7bbd6bb98b552777bf0f8c6e71764c1.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d029605b451b373751adfb4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/380%2520S%2520Arroyo%2520Blvd_039.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59b82d04ad74eb2d80e3ef6c/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-605939740.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d03c47ec9f2f29878f26a88/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/designer-confessions-hotel-room-still.png", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d235672dfe2aa00080ecbeb/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Ace-hotel-Maison-de-la-Luz-MDLL_June2019_SKJ_03.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d07c5bac9f2f252a1f26cdd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-584261880.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0906b0aee365c0d7ac25c7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Charles%2520Zana%2520Portrait%25202%2520(1).jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59b82d04ad74eb2d80e3ef6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-605939740.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Mitchell Owens", "Jennifer Fernandez", "Heather Corcoran", "Madeleine Luckel", "Joyce Che", "Alex Temblador", "Joyce Chen", "Jordi Lippe-Mcgraw"], "canonical_link": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/christina-el-moussa-gives-tips-on-post-breakup-redecorating", "title": "Christina El Moussa Gives Tips on Post-Breakup Redecorating", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Christina El Moussa, the recently single Flip or Flop star, gives fans tips on how to refresh their home after a major breakup or divorce", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "The recently single Flip or Flop star gives fans tips on how to refresh their home after a major breakup or divorce", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59b82d04ad74eb2d80e3ef6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-605939740.jpg", "site_name": "Architectural Digest", "title": "Christina El Moussa Gives Tips on Post-Breakup Redecorating", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/christina-el-moussa-gives-tips-on-post-breakup-redecorating"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The recently single Flip or Flop star gives fans tips on how to refresh their home after a major breakup or divorce", "domain": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59b82d04ad74eb2d80e3ef6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-605939740.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@ArchDigest", "title": "Christina El Moussa Gives Tips on Post-Breakup Redecorating"}, "fb": {"app_id": 267091300008193, "pages": 43794751042, "admins": 108943}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "summary": ""}
