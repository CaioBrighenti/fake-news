Amber Portwood opened up about her recent battle with depression and slammed MTV, ex-boyfriend Gary Shirley and his wife, Kristina Shirley, for bashing her on the upcoming Monday, January 15, episode of Teen Mom OG.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on this show for 10 years. I\u2019ve been through hell! MTV has turned my pregnancy and this relationship into a joke in one of the happiest times of my life,\u201d Portwood, 27, tweeted on Monday. \u201cApparently my life is just for people to tell me how horrible I am as a mother because I went through depression! Remember if you\u2019re going through hell make sure you keep it inside. And people should be able to say whatever they say about you. Especially your ex! Make sure when you\u2019re suicidal that you always have your kid right next to you the whole time! It\u2019s very healthy for them!! Idiots.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom Stars, Then and Now!\n\nThe reality star then thanked her boyfriend, cinematographer Andrew Glennon, for supporting her recovery. \u201cAndrew is the reason I was able to pull myself together! He showed me that life was worth living,\u201d she gushed. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to have him because now I will be ALIVE for my daughter and family!\n\nPortwood also called out Shirley, 31, with whom she shares 9-year-old daughter Leah. \u201cMake sure to watch Gary and Kristina talking s\u2014t about me! It must be hard making money off of me. Being such bad mom and all,\u201d the Marriage Boot Camp star quipped. \u201cWhere would they be? Wait \u2026 in a 1 bedroom shack in the ghetto of Anderson where he was before I got out and the show came back on!! Ignorant!\u201d\n\nAlthough Shirley exclusively told Us in August that Portwood \u201capproves\u201d of his relationship, tensions now seem to be rising.\n\nAs previously reported, Portwood was re-diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder in May 2017. The Never Too Late author opened up about her mental health struggle during an interview with Cosmopolitan in September 2016 after she was first diagnosed. \u201cMy life stops when I\u2019m depressed because there\u2019s no getting out of it. There\u2019s no shaking it off because it\u2019s a chemical imbalance,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cWhen I get depressed, my depression is laying in bed, not moving, not wanting to even take a shower.\u201d\n\nPortwood didn\u2019t think she would be able to have another child, given that the anti-depression medication she has been on may be harmful to a fetus. However, the Indiana native told Us last November that she had weaned off the pills and is expecting her first child and first bundle of joy with Glennon, a baby boy. \u201cI wanted to see if I was just unhappy because of the things that wee going on in my life,\u201d Portwood exclusively told Us. \u201cI needed to see where I was in my head and it\u2019s a beautiful thing because I just feel better. I feel happier and not so depressed.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom OG airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-slams-ex-gary-shirley-and-wife-kristina.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-slams-ex-gary-shirley-and-wife-kristina.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-slams-ex-gary-shirley-and-wife-kristina.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/amber-portwood-slams-ex-gary-shirley-in-twitter-rant/", "title": "Amber Portwood Slams Ex Gary Shirley in Twitter Rant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Amber Portwood called out ex-boyfriend Gary Shirley and his wife, Kristina, for speaking badly about her on the upcoming Monday, January 15, episode of 'Teen Mom OG'\u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Amber Portwood Slams Ex Gary Shirley, Wife Kristina for 'S\u2014t Talking'", "description": "Amber Portwood called out ex-boyfriend Gary Shirley and his wife, Kristina, for speaking badly about her on the upcoming Monday, January 15, episode of 'Teen Mom OG'\u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/amber-portwood-slams-ex-gary-shirley-in-twitter-rant/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-16T01:07:54+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-slams-ex-gary-shirley-and-wife-kristina.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-slams-ex-gary-shirley-and-wife-kristina.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Amber-Portwood-Slams-Ex-Gary-Shirley-and-Wife-Kristina"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "teen mom og", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-01-16T01:06:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-16T01:07:54+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Amber Portwood called out ex-boyfriend Gary Shirley and his wife, Kristina, for speaking badly about her on the upcoming Monday, January 15, episode of 'Teen Mom OG'\u2014 details", "title": "Amber Portwood Slams Ex Gary Shirley, Wife Kristina for 'S\u2014t Talking'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/amber-portwood-slams-ex-gary-shirley-and-wife-kristina.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516064798.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
