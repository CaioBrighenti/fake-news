Gavillet.\n\nAfter some debate about local options that are vegetarian friendly \u2014 Chinese? pizza? \u2014 we settle on Sarabeth\u2019s, an NYC staple. Woods stops in front of the restaurant and poses for a picture for her Instagram; inside, after she orders grilled cheese and tomato soup with a caesar salad, she starts the Instagram filtering process. (In the photo editing app VSCO, for the record.) She decides on making the picture black-and-white, because she wants something different.\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel so ready for change,\u201d she says, coming back to that same common theme. \u201cEvery part of your life is full of ups and downs, so I think you have to be ready for change. My dad passed away at the beginning of the year, and that\u2019s something I never imagined would happen to me at 19. You never know what life is going to throw your way.\u201d\n\n\n\nI press gently about her father\u2019s passing and how she managed to deal with that while also being in the public eye. She takes a deep breath and a few moments before answering.\n\n\n\n\u201cI actually went through kind of a scandal that made everything worse. My dad was in the ICU for about two months; he had meningitis and they kept treating him and doing MRIs, so the hospital bills were insane...the first one alone was like, $200,000. No one has money like that just ready to go, at least my family. So they made a Go Fund Me to raise money, and of course I wanted to post it, because I have a substantial amount of followers. Well, it turned into people attacking me, saying \u2018Your best friend is rich, why would you post this, this is a scam, you\u2019re robbing your fans, you killed your dad for money.\u2019 They were pointing out the nice things I own and saying I should sell them, and leaving snake emojis in my comments.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was doing something simple to help my family, and it caused me to ask myself: Was that wrong? To ask anyone who was willing if they might want to help my family? I turned off my Instagram comments for weeks, and it just made the entire grieving process even more difficult. I understand why people might come to certain assumptions, because I put my life on social media, but I think people went about it the wrong way. I mean, my father died. Is there nothing left that\u2019s going too far?\u201d", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a899ed2b6826791e2b8dd7b2901f3668.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/94aebf5b5499306ab207a2b4f13e34a8.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/563283d1407bc6df5095935bc30a3daa.svg", "https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/439/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1835279/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/94ef6f5acdd752723f8644874464d07a.svg", "https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/b4b/x/1835478/image.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/e0a9b3381492f1a143fc3d5144778c26.svg"], "top_img": "https://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/439/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1835279/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlin Reilly", "Shannon Carlin", "Morgan Baila", "Lia Beck", "Natalie Morin", "Kylie Jenner Best Friend Jordyn Woods Spin Off Tv Show"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/08/168123/jordyn-woods-interview-kylie-jenner-best-friend", "title": "A Day In The Life Of Kylie Jenner's BFF, Model Jordyn Woods", "meta_data": {"title": "Kylie Jenner Best Friend Jordyn Woods Spin Off TV Show", "description": "What's your life like when you're best friends with one of the most recognizable names in the world?
