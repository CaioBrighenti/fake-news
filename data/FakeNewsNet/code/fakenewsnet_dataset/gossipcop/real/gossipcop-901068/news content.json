Following TyLon\u2019s concerned call, police officer Lauren Develle visited the young boy to reassure him that the police would do everything in their power to ensure that the Grinch would not steal Christmas.\n\nIn a Facebook video posted by TyLon\u2019s older brother, TeDera Dwayne Graves, Develle asks TyLon what he would do if the Grinch stole Christmas, something he takes very seriously.\n\n\u201cI want y\u2019all to come back to my house and take him to jail,\u201d he said, citing that the Grinch \u201csteals everybody\u2019s Christmas.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Clarion Ledger, TyLon was invited to come to the police station on Monday to help lock up the Grinch after he was caught. TyLon was also named an honorary junior officer for the day.
