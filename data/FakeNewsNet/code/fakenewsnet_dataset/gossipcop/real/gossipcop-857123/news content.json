It appears on ornate engravings on tombs.\n\nGhaly, a carpenter by trade, is one of the last craftsmen in Egypt keeping the cultural heritage of the instrument alive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an enchanting instrument that summons you in a way, and I answered its call,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nIn the last century, the triangular lyre-lookalike with a round bottom has become associated with the coastal towns dotted around the Suez Canal, especially Port Said.\n\nIt was brought over by Nubian workers who dug the Suez Canal through the Sinai Peninsula. This year marks 150 years since the canal was officially inaugurated.\n\nThe semsemia is normally played in a dhamma (gathering) with a tabla (an Arabic drum) and a riq (tambourine) accompanying as the musicians sing.\n\nGhaly, 52, convened a final dhamma flanked by bulldozers as his workshop in the city\u2019s famous fish markets was demolished to make way for a new shopping mall.\n\nMostly men of all ages played and sang through the night dancing on the rubble.\n\nHe had implored the authorities to save his workshop, where musicians jammed and he had chipped away at making semsemias for over a decade, but to no avail.\n\nWeeks later, however, Ghaly secured a new venue for El Toratheyah \u2014 a folk arts association he founded in 2005 dedicated to the instrument.\n\nCanal 20, his new incarnation, is a cultural museum standing just a stone\u2019s throw away from Port Said\u2019s majestic harbor.\n\nIts mission is to teach the woodshop craft and pass on the semsemia\u2019s musical heritage to a new generation.\n\nFirefighter Ibrahim Awad, 35, a semsemia fan from an early age, was there on the emotional night when Ghaly had to close up shop.\n\n\u201cWhat I love is there isn\u2019t a band with a leader but a palpable spirit you can feel...it\u2019s really interactive,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nWhen British, French and Israeli troops launched an attack in 1956 after then president Gamal Abdel Nasser had nationalized the canal, Egyptians wrote nationalistic songs inspired by their defense of the canal.\n\nThe semsemia became a musical weapon of national resistance.\n\nPort Said, a cosmopolitan trading hub on the Mediterranean that once boasted sizeable communities of French, Greeks, Jews and Italians, was destroyed during the Suez crisis.\n\nIn 1967 when Israel occupied the Sinai, Ghaly\u2019s family was among thousands of residents displaced to other parts of Egypt.\n\nBut he never forgot his Port Saidi roots.\n\n\u201cI used to hear it on the radio and that made me fall in love with it. Here I was a Port Saidi away from my home \u2014 so that left a mark on me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe started tinkering around with making his own semsemias in the 1980s.\n\nAfter a musician asked Ghaly to make him one, he enjoyed the challenge of putting his carpentry skills to good use and has professionally been crafting them since 2003.\n\n\u201cWhen I am crafting it, I\u2019m either in a really good mood or a bad one. When I\u2019m really upset, I actually make the best semsemias. I live through the craft,\u201d he said.\n\nIman Haddo, 20, is part of the young crowd that gathers at Canal 20, where Ghaly displays old photographs of semsemia legends.\n\nShe instantly fell in love with the semsemia when she was a teenager after attending a local concert with her father.\n\n\u201cI heard the semsemia for the first time about seven years ago. It was very strange for me, I\u2019d never seen it before and you never see it around really,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI also questioned why it was only boys playing and asked where are the girls,\u201d Haddo said.\n\nSemsemia players are mostly older men.\n\nStrumming the semsemia\u2019s strings came naturally to her, and a year ago, Haddo started the Arab world\u2019s first all-female semsemia choir called Amwag (waves).\n\n\u201cIn our local folk culture, girls would dance and perform to the tune of the semsemia but they weren\u2019t ever expected to play so I thought why not start a girls\u2019 band,\u201d she said.\n\nThey practice three times a week at Canal 20 and have been invited to play at music festivals.\n\n\u201cWe want to show music lovers that the semsemia isn\u2019t just for men, that women can play it well and be successful at it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe also want to save our heritage.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_360_212/public/2017/05/08/907761-1804490872.jpg?itok=cPamaMj0", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_670_395/public/2017/05/25/917756-509347835.jpg?itok=yKBFACKo", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2019/07/13/1664661-1537771065.jpg?itok=0v7MQsBL", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2019/07/09/1659586-523597044.jpg?itok=rNZLrpBT", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2019/07/13/1664701-702026794.jpg?itok=zWf0puij", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2019/07/12/1662871-341826522.jpg?itok=7QpUCoz4", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2019/07/11/1661031-1792860149.jpg?itok=sZra3D7K", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_360_212/public/main-image/2019/06/23/1635221-782185524.jpg?itok=RZpkYzb_", "https://collector.effectivemeasure.net/noscript", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_670_395/public/main-image/2019/07/12/1663356-41514537.jpg?itok=nLx-JS5T", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_360_212/public/main-image/2019/07/05/1652821-662158189.jpg?itok=jo8zi79m", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2019/07/13/1664731-315417312.jpg?itok=YCa-P-tc", "http://mena-gmtdmp.mookie1.com/t/v2/learn?tagid=V2_605775&src.rand=[timestamp]", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/all/themes/narabnews/assets/img/logo.png?xxx", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2019/07/13/1664691-492786625.jpg?itok=MDPl4l44", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2019/07/13/1664681-1485419596.jpg?itok=vvNDXtLW", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2017/05/25/917756-509347835.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2017/05/25/917756-509347835.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.arabnews.com/node/1104606/art-culture", "title": "\u2018I\u2019d never make it in Bollywood,\u2019 Brad Pitt tells Shah Rukh Khan", "meta_data": {"description": "MUMBAI: Brad Pitt told Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan that he doesn\u2019t have the moves to star in Bollywood films as he promoted his new movie \u201cWar Machine\u201d in Mumbai on Wednesday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make it Bollywood because I can\u2019t dance or sing,\u201d said the American actor during an event with Khan in front of journalists in India\u2019s financial capital.
