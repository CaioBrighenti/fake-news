Love u @tishcyrus @billyraycyrus,\u201d Miley commented.\n\nAlthough the throwback photo was from years ago (peep that '80s-esque hair), you could have fooled us. Billy Ray posted a recent photo to commemorate the day, and the photos look minutes apart.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\n\u201cCelebratin\u2019 24 years of marriage with my love @tishcyrus,\u201d the \"Achy Breaky Heart\" singer captioned it.\n\nMaybe the two have found a fountain of youth , or maybe it\u2019s all the love keeping them young. It hasn\u2019t always been smooth sailing for this couple, but the pair always seem to find each other again.\n\nBilly Ray filed for divorce back in 2010, but dropped the filing in 2011. Two years later, Tish filed for divorce, but with the help of couples therapy they decided to make it work.\n\n\"We both woke up and realized we love each other and decided we want to stay together. We both went into couples therapy, something we haven't done in 22 years of being together, and it's brought us closer together and really opened up our communication in amazing ways,\" Billy Ray's rep previously told Us Weekly .\n\nSee more : Miley Cyrus Shares the Marriage Lesson She's Learned From Her Parents\n\nBilly Ray and Tish have even passed their relationship knowledge down to daughter Miley. The 24-year-old opened up in the September issue of Cosmopolitan about the life lessons they taught her.\n\n\u201cNothing and no one stays the same,\u201d she told the mag. \u201cGrow, evolve, change with each other and celebrate your love\u2019s journey!\u201d\n\nClearly she was listening. Miley told Billboard a few months back she and Hemsworth had grown and changed so much since their initial 2013 engagement they pretty much had to start over.\n\n\u201cI needed to change so much,\" she said. \"And changing with someone else not changing like that is too hard. Suddenly you\u2019re like, 'I don\u2019t recognize you anymore.' We had to refall for each other.\"\n\nWith wisdom and advice like this, we expect a lot of love for the Cyrus couples.", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/59833ec6ef2a6927d0c4ecc1/master/pass/GettyImages-477359332.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5d14ba540f495a0008cef73b/1:1/w_125/jfk%2520carolyn%2520.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5cbdfae11386951d119560ec/1:1/w_125/BR060119budget_7080.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5d278ba16923c40008df617f/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1128393023.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/59833ec6ef2a6927d0c4ecc1/1:1/w_767/GettyImages-477359332.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/59833ec6ef2a6927d0c4ecc1/master/pass/GettyImages-477359332.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/miley-cyrus-wishes-parents-a-happy-anniversary-with-throwback-photo", "title": "Miley Cyrus Wishes Her Parents a Happy Anniversary with a Deliciously '80s Throwback Photo", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Billy Ray and Tish Cyrus celebrated 24 years of marriage on December 29, and Miley shared the best photo for the occasion.", "og": {"description": "Now that's one good looking couple\u2014even after 24 years of marriage!", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/59833ec6ef2a6927d0c4ecc1/master/pass/GettyImages-477359332.jpg", "title": "Miley Cyrus Wishes Her Parents A Happy Anniversary With a Deliciously '80s Throwback Photo", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/miley-cyrus-wishes-parents-a-happy-anniversary-with-throwback-photo", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now that's one good looking couple\u2014even after 24 years of marriage!", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/59833ec6ef2a6927d0c4ecc1/master/pass/GettyImages-477359332.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Miley Cyrus Wishes Her Parents A Happy Anniversary With a Deliciously '80s Throwback Photo", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/miley-cyrus-wishes-parents-a-happy-anniversary-with-throwback-photo", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "News", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
