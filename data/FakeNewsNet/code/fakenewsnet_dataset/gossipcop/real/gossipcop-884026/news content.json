The opposition\u2019s lawyer has already accused Carrey of giving White three sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The letter was allegedly written in April 2013.\n\nWhite intentionally overdosed on prescription medication, which was supposedly provided by Carrey. The wrongful death lawsuit against Carrey was filed by White\u2019s estranged husband, Mark Burton, and White\u2019s mother, Brigid Sweetman, who amalgamated their complaints into one single case.\n\nWATCH BELOW: The latest on the Jim Carrey lawsuit\n\nThe body of the 30-year-old makeup artist, originally from Ireland, was discovered in her Los Angeles home in September 2015. She and Carrey, 55, met in 2012, and dated on and off.\n\nThere was some hope for a settlement out-of-court between the parties, but Burton and Sweetman\u2019s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has insisted multiple times in the past that he wants Carrey to take the stand at trial and has been demanding his deposition for months.\n\nOn Friday, Carrey filed a counter-complaint against Burton, Sweetman and White\u2019s lawyer Filippo Machino (along with Machino\u2019s office, The X Law Group). Carrey once again alleged that the lawsuit is an extortion attempt.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JimCarrey/status/913891847570722816\n\nIn response to the counter-complaint, Avenatti released the 2013 letter.\n\nComposed on an iPad in Notes, the note is meant for Carrey and was released by Avenatti after the legal team uncovered it \u201cduring a forensic examination of Ms. White\u2019s iPad.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if Carrey or anyone else read the note prior to White\u2019s death.\n\nREAD MORE: Jim Carrey responds to ex-girlfriend\u2019s mother\u2019s lawsuit: it\u2019s a \u2018shakedown\u2019\n\nAvenatti said in a statement that the note is \u201cwritten in Cat\u2019s own words, [and] shows the world how Jim Carrey treated her while she was alive and the depths of his destructive behavior.\u201d\n\nAs he\u2019s stated in the past, Avenatti then said he\u2019s looking forward to trying the case in front of a jury.\n\nIn response to the letter, Carrey\u2019s lawyer Ray Boucher said, \u201cThis note helps establish the evidence that this was pure fraud, and that [White], her lawyers and others were trying to establish a basis for Jim into ultimately settling with her based on these false claims\u2026 this was part of her and her lawyers\u2019 [sic] campaign to extort money from Jim and ultimately he succumbed.\u201d\n\nIn yet another response, Avenatti responded to Boucher, saying \u201cJim Carrey is so desperate to avoid the public knowing the truth about his own outrageous conduct that he has now resorted to outlandish accusations against innocent people. As his interview from a few weeks ago shows, the guy is incoherent and unhinged. He needs help.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Jim Carrey responds to \u2018evil\u2019 lawsuit: I will not be exploited\n\nIn August, Carrey was permitted by the court to use White\u2019s health records at trial.\n\nBoucher had previously attempted to get the judge to throw the lawsuit out of court, calling it \u201cmalicious\u201d and \u201cpredatory.\u201d Carrey himself has called the lawsuit a \u201cshakedown,\u201d and denies any wrongdoing on all accounts.\n\nBoucher contends that White had breast augmentation surgery prior to her death, and had been prescribed painkillers and other pills that ultimately led to her overdose.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues is her prescription medication,\u201d said Boucher in court. \u201cWe know she had breast surgery that month, we know she had oxycodone prescribed to her.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Jim Carrey to give deposition in ex-girlfriend\u2019s wrongful death lawsuit\n\nHer family\u2019s legal team attempted to argue against the medical records\u2019 admission on privacy grounds, but Judge Deirdre Hill ruled that the records could be disclosed.\n\nThe medical records should also determine whether or not White had any STIs prior to dating Carrey.\n\nThe actor will face the jury trial in April 2018.\n\nIf you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, is in crisis or needs someone to talk to, you can find 24-hour help through the
