What do you need me for?\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Alec Baldwin singles out Stephen Colbert, John Oliver for turning talk shows onto \u2018grand juries\u2019\n\nThen Clarice has a special request: to join the notorious serial killer inside his cell \u2014 because \u201cit seems safer in there than it does out here.\u201d\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT on
