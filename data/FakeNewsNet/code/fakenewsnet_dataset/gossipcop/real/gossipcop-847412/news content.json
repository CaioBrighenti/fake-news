Liam Payne confirmed via Twitter that he and Cheryl Cole did in fact name their newborn son Bear.\n\nThe former One Direction singer, 23, subtly revealed the news during an exchange with TV personality Bear Grylls.\n\nThanks man hope he grows with an ounce of your courage! Your a boss \u2014 Liam (@LiamPayne) May 2, 2017\n\n\u201cGreat choice! Love & blessings to you guys as you start on the greatest adventure\u2026 @CherylOfficial @LiamPayne,\u201d Grylls, 42, tweeted to the new dad, along with a Daily Mail story reporting about the name.\n\nPayne replied: \u201cThanks man hope he grows with an ounce of your courage!

We haven\u2019t named him yet but he\u2019s already capturing hearts including mine. I feel very blessed.\u201d\n\nThe singer and Cole first met when he auditioned on the U.K.\u2019s The X Factor in 2008, when he was 14.
