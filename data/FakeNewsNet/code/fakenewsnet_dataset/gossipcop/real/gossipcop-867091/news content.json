Click for the details!\n\nNicole Williams\u2019 new business venture\n\nCanadian TV personality Nicole Williams has started a new collaborative venture with Forever 21 beauty product manufacturers. Nicole Williams had always been an avid fan and user of beauty products manufactured by Forever 21. She used to use their coffee-based body scrubs three times a week. She found that it enhanced her skin glow. She found these products particularly useful during her wedding and Mexican honeymoon.\n\nTalking about her routine with the skin exfoliation products, Nicole Williams revealed to E! News:\n\n\u201cI prepped my skin with the scrub two days leading up to my honeymoon. I made sure all of the dead skin was off, so my skin would be hydrated and glowing,\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\n\u201cI also let the scrub sit on my face for five minutes before rinsing it off.\u201d\n\nAnd the result was obvious. She looked prettier and glowing on her Playa del Carmen trip with her husband Larry English.\n\nNicole Williams disclosed:\n\n\u201c[Body Blendz] contacted me and said \u2018We know you\u2019re obsessed with our products, would you want to create your own?'\u201d\n\nNicole Williams was, of course, excited about this offer. She enthusiastically asked the brand:\n\n\u201cHow can we make this smell like a vacation?\u201d\n\nThe result was a collaborative effort and the emergence of the new coffee body scrub with a tropical twist called as Body Blendz Mandarin Mist.\n\nNicole Williams\u2019 relationship with Larry English\n\nNicole Williams was dating former NFL player Larry English since 2013. Larry English and Nicole Williams had gone to Thailand in September 2016 as part of the E! Reality TV series. It was here that Larry English had proposed to Nicole Williams in front of the rolling cameras. They got engaged soon after. Nicole Williams\u2019 engagement ring was a 6-carat planet-sized diamond ring. Nicole told \u2018Stylish\u2019:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been together for four years, so this has been a dream of mine for a long time now. Larry loves to surprise me. I usually catch on when he\u2019s acting funny \u2026 but I never expected THIS!\u201d\n\nThe diamond ring was priced as $ 250000. It was learned that Larry English had helped in the design of the ring. The diamond was set in an 18-carat rose gold and was surrounded by a diamond band studded with more than 100 stones. Talking about her experience with such a heavy and costly ring, Nicole said:\n\n\u201cI definitely have to get used to wearing a ring on this finger. Larry says I do this weird thing with my hand now. \u2018Well, it\u2019s heavy!\u2019 I said. But I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d\n\nNicole was ecstatic. She said:\n\n\u201cI get to marry my best friend!\u201d\n\nThe wedding\n\nOn 19th May 2017, the couple got married at Montage Laguna Beach in southern California. Nicole\u2019s bridesmaids were Shanina Shaik, Christina Milian, and WAGS co-star Olivia Pierson. Other stars included Wilmer Valderrama, Karrueche Tran, and Brody Jenner. The bride looked gorgeous in a tailor-made white Michael Costello wedding gown. It has a plunging neckline and lacy details. There was a long traditional white veil. Larry looked dapper in a white jacket, black trousers, and leather shoes.\n\nAll the guests were at their best. The couple said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both so full of love in this moment and we couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d\n\nThe couple then proceeded for their honeymoon to Mexico. They decided to enjoy their time at Playa del Carmen, the coastal city in Mexico. The vibrant sea life and underwater caverns thrilled them and rejuvenated them.", "images": ["https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TaylorSwift-232x290.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mark-lowe-400x280.jpeg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Erika-Choperena-60x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Noelle-Sheldon-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/r.-kelly-232x290.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ronnie_Ortiz_Magro-400x280.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chauncey_Carter-232x290.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kim-and-kanye-400x280.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cattgallinger4--400x280.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/download-21.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rs_1024x759-170714134832-1024.Nicole-Williams-Body-Scrub.jl_.071417.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jacob-Hoggard-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bertie-Highmore-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cali-Sheldon-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Max-Kellerman-60x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Staz-Nair-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Martin-McDonagh-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Julie-Ertz-60x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nicole-williams-prettylittlething-campaign-launch-for-plt-shape-in-la-4-11-2017-1.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/stefanie-and-demian-400x280.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/share.png", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/plugins/married-biography//public/images/ajax-loader.gif", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/38CF33AB00000578-3807898-There_it_goes_English_slipped_on_the_Ritani_ring_that_he_helped_-a-100_1474903619389dm.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/elly-mayday-400x280.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/john-m-232x290.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/miley-cyrus--232x290.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/song-joong-ki-232x290.jpg"], "top_img": "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nicole-williams-prettylittlething-campaign-launch-for-plt-shape-in-la-4-11-2017-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://marriedbiography.com/nicole-williams-her-new-entrepreneur-role-her-engagement-wedding-and-honeymoon-click-for-the-details/", "title": "Nicole Williams: her new entrepreneur role, her engagement, wedding and honeymoon!
