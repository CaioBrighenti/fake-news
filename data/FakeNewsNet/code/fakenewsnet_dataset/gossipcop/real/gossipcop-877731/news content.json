I have got to shake the hand of a real-life hero,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nThe Rock flew Jacob and his family to Vancouver where they were VIPs on the set of Skyscraper.\n\nThe movie star said Jacob was nervous and shy when they first met but he eventually got some laughs out of him.\n\nThe kids got to eat all the chocolate and candy they could possibly want.\n\nAnd he had a hug for mom as well:\n\nJohnson also posted a video explaining the shirt Jacob wore to the set, which he made himself.\n\nIt had the actor\u2019s bull insignia on the front and on the back was a picture of Johnson holding his two puppies, Brutus and Hobbs, after he had rescued them from the pool.\n\nJohnson said seeing that \u201cgot him in the gut\u201d because Jacob has such a big heart he put Johnson\u2019s two puppies on his shirt even after he saved his brother\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cWhat a special day. What a special kid. Thanks Jacob for being awesome and for being the kind of person we all aspire to be,\u201d wrote Johnson on Instagram.\n\n\u2014 With files from Simon Little, CKNW, and Katie Scott", "images":
