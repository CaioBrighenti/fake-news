The actress and an unidentified friend are seen posing next to a large arrangement of pink and white flowers.\n\n\u201cStopping to smell the flowers on a gorgeous Sunday!\u201d she captioned the snap.\n\nLast week, Bynes stepped out with a friend for a hike in North Hollywood, as she wore an all-black getup and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nAfter a turbulent few years, Bynes has rarely made public appearances, instead shifting her focus from acting to her budding fashion career.\n\nBynes last posted to Twitter in February to shoot down rumors that she was engaged and pregnant.\n\n\u201cI am not getting married and I am not pregnant,\u201d the child star said in response to a fake Twitter account that posted an image of a woman (who bears a resemblance to Bynes) getting an ultrasound.\n\n\u201cI have asked repeatedly. This person continues to impersonate and harass me and twitter needs to take the account down,\u201d she continued.\n\nImage zoom\n\nStopping to smell the flowers on a gorgeous Sunday! pic.twitter.com/4xINyMCwPp \u2014 amanda bynes (@amandabynes) April 24, 2017\n\nThe Hairspray star previously surprised her 3.3 million followers in August with an update on her life post-Hollywood.\n\n\u201cHi everybody!
