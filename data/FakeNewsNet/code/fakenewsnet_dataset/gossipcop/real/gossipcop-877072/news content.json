That\u2019s according to Variety, which reports that Simpsons producer Richard Sakai recently called Clausen and told him that the show is looking for \u201ca different kind of music,\u201d so someone different will be scoring the series from now on. Considering how omnipresent and iconic Clausen\u2019s score has been, though, it seems likely that any \u201cdifferent kind of music\u201d will be a huge change for The Simpsons.\n\nVariety expects that this decision was because of money, which has been a regular issue for the show over the last few years, with the story saying that the costs for scoring the series \u201croutinely run into the millions of dollars per year\u201d because of Matt Groening\u2019s insistence that it use a 35-piece orchestra for every episode. It\u2019s unclear which cheap scab will be hired to replace Clausen, but Danny Elfman\u2019s famous Simpsons theme will most likely stick around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClausen won two Emmy awards for his work on The Simpsons, and he has been nominated 21 times on top of that. His final episode was the season 28 finale, which aired earlier this year.", "images": ["https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=5zq9nmk&ct=0:ngtk7da&fmt=3", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--kLKfYUa1--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/ydjpqkedclcjtkzwudz8.jpg", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/activity;dc_iu=/4246/DFP_Audience_Pixel;dc_seg=22540930;blog=avclub;ord=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6770184&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2ZcsrHuG--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/zoew1v4cqizb7rccgca5.jpg", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--DYeF8CAl--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/zoew1v4cqizb7rccgca5.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--DYeF8CAl--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/zoew1v4cqizb7rccgca5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Barsanti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.avclub.com/longtime-composer-alf-clausen-has-been-fired-from-the-s-1798639971", "title": "Longtime composer Alf Clausen has been fired from The Simpsons", "meta_data": {"dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-edd40da2ae92de7cb0979025edd33027.css", "google-site-verification": "P13oAn8o8LB6FVCJWKsHWXvxfbR-SJrmvox6EgULpUs", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--MI9Nx2yt--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Ha40b6eI--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "keywords": "TV, The Simpsons, Alf Clausen, Fox, The A.V.
