Sure, a bunch of makeup products out there claim to be water-resistant or long-wearing, but can they actually do what they say? You'll have to find out in the video below, and make sure to watch until the very end to see what happens when Maria dunks her entire face into a bowl of water! And keep reading to see where you can buy each of the products.\n\n\n\n1. Milani Conceal + Perfect 2-in-1 Foundation + Concealer\n\nUlta Beauty\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nThis product claims to be long-wearing, water-resistant, and sweat-proof. For this video, Maria applied the foundation to the back of her hand and then used her fingers to apply it all over her face. (If you want to check out a life-changing hack on how to apply liquid foundation with your fingers, check this out.)\n\nOverall, Maria was very impressed with the coverage! It went on super smooth. Plus, her skin felt pretty bare, almost as if she had nothing on.\n\n2. NYX Gotcha Covered Concealer\n\nNYX Professional Makeup\n\nSHOP NOW\n\nThis product claims to be waterproof and full coverage. Maria dabbed the product onto her ring finger and only applied a small amount to her under eye area. Unfortunately, the concealer did add a little bit of shine to her face, but according to Maria, the good news is that it does in fact provide full coverage.\n\n3. Essence All About Matt! Fixing Compact Powder Waterproof\n\nUlta Beauty\n\nSHOP NOW\n\nAccording to Maria, this powder did a great job of removing some of the shine on her face. However, it did leave a little bit of a white cast. (Hey, no product is perfect, right?!)\n\n4. Rimmel Natural Bronzer\n\nRimmel London\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nHeads up, Maria noticed there aren't too many waterproof bronzers out there, but she did manage to score this super affordable option! (Now, if you're still not sure exactly where to apply bronzer, head over to this helpful tutorial.)\n\nAs it turns out, not only is this product low-cost, but it also works really well. According to Maria, it is really easy to blend out.\n\n5. NYX Proof It! Waterproof Eyeshadow Primer\n\nNYX Professional Makeup\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nYep, apparently a product like this exists! This product claims that it can work well with any type of eyeshadow and make it budge-proof. It's an interesting concept, but Maria did note it felt a little stickier than other eye primers.\n\nWhether or not it really works is up for debate. After Maria got her face wet, there was some eye product on her towel. However, the eye makeup left on her face looked pretty flawless.\n\n6. Maybelline Eyestudio Color Tattoo Concentrated Crayon\n\nUlta Beauty\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nNext, Maria applied this \"color tattoo\" to add a champagne color to her lids. After blending it out with her fingers, Maria realized that she absolutely loved the color! But, the lids still felt kind of sticky...\n\n7. Maybelline Eyestudio Lasting Drama Gel Eyeliner\n\nMaybelline New York\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nTo create a class winged line on her upper lashes, Maria used Maybelline's gel liner.\n\n8. Rimmel Scandleyes Waterproof Kohl Kajal Eyeliner\n\nCVS Pharmacy\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nOn her lower waterline, Maria applied this waterproof eyeliner. After applying both eye products, Maria decided that they worked really well and glided on very smoothly.\n\n9. Maybelline TattooStudio Waterproof Eyebrow Gel\n\nTarget\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nThis product claims to be so powerful that it can last up to two days! Crazy, right?! Well, Maria says she loves the gel-like texture, so let's hope it really lasts that long. But as for the waterproof test, this gel definitely passed. Even after Maria dunked her face in water, the pigment did not move.\n\n10. L'Oreal Voluminous Lash Paradise Waterproof Mascara\n\nUlta Beauty\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nReal talk, Maria is absolutely obsessed with this mascara. She was worried that because it was waterproof, it might turn out to be clumpy, but that was definitely not the case. However, once she wet her face, there was some smudging underneath her eyes.\n\n11. NYX Liquid Suede Cream Lipstick\n\nNYX Professional Makeup\n\nSHOP NOW\n\n\n\nMaria tried out this lipstick in the shade \"Soft-Spoken,\" which according to Ulta Beauty is a fan fave.\n\nVictoria Rodriguez is a fellow at Seventeen.com.
