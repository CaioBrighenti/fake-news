While Teresa has since completed her stint behind bars, Joe is currently serving his 41-month sentence. According to People, the judge handed down a harsh punishment because the couple failed to disclose all of its financial details to the court. They were accused of hiding their assets in the initial bankruptcy filing and, in addition, Joe stood accused of not filing tax returns between 2004 and 2008. He began his prison term at New Jersey's Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in March 2016.\n\nHis brother-in-law, Joe Gorga, updated Extra: \"Joe's doing good, you know, he's doing his thing, he's working out a lot, looking great.\" His wife also updated fans, saying her hubby is slimming down behind bars. \"He's very in shape,\" she told People in January 2018 of his 40-45 pound weight loss. \"He works out. Not that he never worked out before, but it was all that alcohol he was drinking and whatever. He's in tip-top shape now.\"\n\nFit physique aside, Joe Giudice faces another legal challenge upon is release from prison: deportation. Though his defense team appealed a judge's October 2018 decision to expel the reality star from the U.S., as of this writing, it's still unclear whether he will return to his New Jersey digs or his home country of Italy.", "images": ["https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/intro-1543945636.jpg", "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/intro-1543945636.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/getting-swole-in-the-slammer-1543945636.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/intro-1543945636.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christian Baker", "Carmen Ribecca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/74842/celebrities-currently-jail/", "title": "Celebrities who are currently in jail", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "//img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/upgrade-celebrities-currently-behind-bars/intro-1543945636.jpg", "title": "Celebrities who are currently in jail", "description": "These stars made big splashes in the world of sports, acting, and music, but bad decisions changed the course of their careers and landed them behind bars.
