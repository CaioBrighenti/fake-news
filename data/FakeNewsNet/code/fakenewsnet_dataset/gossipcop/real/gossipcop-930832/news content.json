The Association of National Advertisers (ANA) launched the #SeeHer initiative in June 2016 in a partnership with The Female Quotient (TFQ) at the United State of Women. SeeHer\u2019s mission is to increase the accurate portrayals of women and girls in media 20 percent by 2020, the 100th anniversary of women winning the right to vote in the U.S. The group developed a Gender Equality Measure (GEM\u2122) to track progress and the marketing effect of removing unconscious bias from ads and programming. High GEM\u2122 scores directly correlate to improved ROI. GEM\u2122 won the 2017 ESOMAR Research Effectiveness Award. The methodology became the industry standard in the U.S., which led to a global rollout in 2018.
