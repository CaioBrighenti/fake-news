Chris Hemsworth revealed that he felt intimidated meeting Chris Pratt for the first time in a new interview with Elle published on Tuesday, August 15. The duo worked together on 2018\u2019s Avengers: Infinity War, which will feature Hemsworth as Thor and Pratt as Star-Lord.\n\n\u201cThe first time I really met Chris Pratt and went on set with him and the Guardians, I was weirdly shaken,\u201d the 34-year-old actor admitted to the publication. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. He\u2019s just so charismatic. And good at what he does.\u201d\n\nPrior to the release of the Marvel team-up, Hemsworth is starring in Thor: Ragnarok, opposite the franchise\u2019s first female villain, Hela, the goddess of death, played by Cate Blanchett.\n\nHemsworth admitted that he experienced similar feelings of intimidation when he first met the Blue Jasmine actress. Blanchett \u201ccalls you on your shit straightaway. Which is intimidating,\u201d he pointed out to Elle.\u201cYou walk in and you\u2019re doing all the usual polite chats, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Chris, what are you doing? Really, that\u2019s the story you\u2019re gonna tell?\u2019 \u2018And you\u2019re like, S\u2013t, I\u2019m not going to get away with anything with this lady. I have to drop the facade.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cShe\u2019s Cate Blanchett, for God\u2019s sake! There\u2019s quite a feeling of wanting to impress her. She\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m a human being. Act normal.\u2019 Before you know it, you\u2019re drinking and telling stories and cracking jokes. She has a wild sense of humor.\u201d\n\nThe Australian native also touched on his personal life, opening up about his nearly seven year marriage to Spanish actress Elsa Pataky. The hunk told the magazine that he hasn\u2019t mastered his wife\u2019s native language.\n\n\u201cI speak some Spanish,\u201d the Blackhat actor admitted. \u201cAbout 15 words.\u201d\n\nWhen Hemsworth was asked if he has ever senses the Fast & Furious 6 actress talks about him in spanish, he replied: \u201cYes. When I hear my wife and my mother-in-law starting to quietly mumble something, I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Guys, guys\u2014I understand more than you think.\u201d\u2019\n\nThor: Ragnarok hits theaters on November 3.\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
