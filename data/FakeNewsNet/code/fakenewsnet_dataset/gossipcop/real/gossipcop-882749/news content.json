That includes the biggest opening for a horror movie, the largest opening for a September movie, and the highest grossing horror film ever.\n\nThe King novel was always meant to be adapted into two parts, with the first movie focusing on the children\u2019s experience with the iconic monster and the follow-up to be told from the adults\u2019 perspective.\n\nSee Video: 'It' Child Actors First Saw Pennywise on Camera: 'We Wanted Their Reactions to Be Real'\n\n\u201cIt\u201d starred Bill Skarsgard, Finn Wolfhard, Jaeden Lieberher, Wyatt Oleff and Chosen Jacobs, and was directed by Andy Muschietti.
