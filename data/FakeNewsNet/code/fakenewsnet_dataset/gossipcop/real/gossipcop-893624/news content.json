Magazine tweeted a story with the headline \u201cPregnant Kailyn Lowry takes DNA test \u2014 Is Chris Lopez REALLY the baby daddy?\u201d the Teen Mom 2 star, 25, replied, \u201cAncestry DNA & yeah he is\u2026 stop with the headlines already.\u201d Find out more in the video above, and detailed below.\n\nAncestry DNA & yeah he is\u2026 stop with the headlines already. https://t.co/tAB1ef6RHu \u2014 Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) May 2, 2017\n\nFans first speculated that Lopez was the baby\u2019s father last week when Lowry shared an Instagram photo of herself cradling her baby bump with the caption, \u201cHappy bump day from Baby Lo & me.\u201d Some people guessed that \u201cLo\u201d came from Lowry\u2019s own last name, while others suggested that she was referring to her friend Lopez.\n\nThe 16 and Pregnant alum confirmed her third pregnancy in late February, but had yet to identify the father. She already has two sons: Isaac, 7, with ex Jo Rivera, and Lincoln, 3, with ex-husband Javi Marroquin.\n\nCelebrity Babies 2016\n\n\u201cPlease know this was a choice I made,\u201d Lowry wrote of her pregnancy in a February 24 blog post. \u201cI already know some won\u2019t agree but I\u2019ve been showered with support by the ones I love since I found out. Why did I wait? I\u2019ve had a lot of health complications leading up to this pregnancy and I was not ready to release such private information on my own just yet being that I am so high risk with this pregnancy. I didn\u2019t want to announce just to have another miscarriage and suffer through another grief. \u2026 I know this isn\u2019t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay.\u201d\n\nIn addition to preparing for the upcoming birth of her third bundle of joy, the MTV star is set to graduate from Delaware State University later this month. She shared a series of adorable cap and gown photos with her sons on her blog on Sunday, April 30. \u201cThis has been an extremely long and emotional road for me and for my family,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
