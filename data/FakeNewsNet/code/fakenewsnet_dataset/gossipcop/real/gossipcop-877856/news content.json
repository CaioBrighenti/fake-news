Moments so cool, so fun, so WTF-random that we can't help but share them with everyone who's following along. Here, a running list of our favorites:\n\nEckhaus Latta shows at PS1\n\nA snowy, 9:30 p.m. time slot at MoMA's space in Long Island City could be enough to torpedo your show, but it was standing room only at Eckhaus Latta. Designers Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta used their friends as models (as they do every season\u2014last year Lena Dunham's sister Grace walked) and showed off a strong collection of oversize knits, nubby coats, and gender-neutral garments. More on why everyone can't stop talking about this brand, here.\n\nChristelle de Castro\n\nLady Gaga sits front row at Brandon Maxwell\n\nFresh off of her Grammy's David Bowie tribute, Gaga attends her good friend's (and fashion director's) lovely show. Read more about how much I loved it, here.\n\nLady Gaga and Brandon Maxwell Getty Images\n\nThom Browne's Haunted Park\n\nBrowne's shows are always highly conceptual, and this season was no different. It began with a white-face painted duo taking their dog for a walk in what looked like an early 20th century haunted park. They stopped for a moment on a bench, which signaled the female models to slowly walk past the men in Thom Browne designs, wearing\u2014what's that?\u2014tie hats by Stephen Jones.\n\nGypsy Sport ends with a dance party\n\nRio Uribe, the Los Angeles designer behind Gypsy Sport, staged a show at Milk Studios that could more aptly be described as a dance party. Models break-danced, up and coming singer Justine Skye walked, Diandra Forrest even carried her baby on the runway! At the end, everyone came out and dance, dance revolutioned like nobody's business.\n\nPyer Moss addresses mental health while a choir sang trap music in the background.\n\nConfused? Check out my story on his show and collaboration with Erykah Badu.\n\nPyer Moss Fall 2016 Getty Images\n\nMoncler shows outside of Lincoln Center on what was probably the coldest day of New York Fashion Week\n\nThe show was surely spectacular\u2014it involved 80 athletes doing intense choreography, plus more models who showed of the brands designs\u2014but it was literally freezing outside (well, technically it was below freezing). Bold move, Moncler. Bold move.\n\nHood by Air's ENTIRE show.\n\nStaged at Moynihan Station, Shayne Oliver's HBA show, entitled \"Pilgrimage,\" featured models (including radical Russian artist Slava Mogutin and a musician/performer named Hirakish) clomping down the runway and in and out of the stands. Each wore an 18th-century wig and rocked \"dirty\" manicures. As for the clothes, the mix of leather, fur, fire-engine red and black patent leather thigh-high boots, and plastic shrink wrap used to for luggage (!) made for a captivating and directional collection.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Fenty x Puma by Rihanna show was as low-key as it could get.\n\nWalking in to a cavernous space in the Financial District, I expected glitz, glamour, a bit of drama at the door, and around the same level of spectacle as there was at Yeezy Season 3. Instead, I got a wonderfully orchestrated show full of Japanese streetwear\u2013inspired gear from Ri, the new women's wear creative director of Puma. Definitely impressed.\n\nWho knew Pete Wentz loved fashion so much?\n\nMonse, Yeezy Season 3, Fenty x Puma by Rihanna, Guess x A$AP Rocky party: Just a few of the places we've spotted the Fall Out Boy bassist this week.\n\nGetty Images\n\nRachel Antonoff's presentation turned Broadway production.\n\nInstead of putting on another fashion show, the designer brought out a group of women to perform \"A Secretary Is Not a Toy\" from the Broadway musical How to Succeed in Business Without Even Trying. Ali Stroker, who made history by becoming the first actor in a wheelchair on Broadway, sang lead.\n\nGetty Images\n\nYeezy Season 3.\n\nReally, need I say more?\n\nAlice Smith sings live at Kate Spade New York at the Rainbow Room.\n\nThere are so many cool things about this one. Kate Spade New York staged its presentation at The Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of the NBC Building. As models slowly rotated on a platform, Alice Smith, the soulful singer who starred in the label's holiday 2015 campaign, crooned behind them.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/2560x1280/landscape-1455664336-elle-fashion-week-moments-index.jpg?resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/2560x1280/landscape-1455664336-elle-fashion-week-moments-index.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nikki", "Style Director", "Nikki Ogunnaike", "Style Director Of Elle.Com", "Is The Go-To Style Expert For The Million", "Users", "Fans", "Followers Of What Is Now The Largest Fashion", "Beauty Magazine Website."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a34062/best-craziest-moments-new-york-fashion-week/", "title": "All the Weird and Wild and Awesome Things That Happened at New York Fashion Week", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "All the Weird and Wild and Awesome Things That Happened at New York Fashion Week", "description": "Multiple Pete Wentz sightings.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a34062/best-craziest-moments-new-york-fashion-week/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/2560x1280/landscape-1455664336-elle-fashion-week-moments-index.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2017-10-09 05:41:37", "published_time": "2016-02-20 01:12:00", "section": "Fashion"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/2560x1280/landscape-1455664336-elle-fashion-week-moments-index.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "A Running List of the Best, Craziest, and Most Random Moments of New York Fashion Week", "description": "Multiple Pete Wentz sightings.", "keywords": "Fashion Week,Fashion", "auto-publish": "evergreen", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/980x980/square-1455664336-elle-fashion-week-moments-index.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Fashion,fashion", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-20T01:12:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/2560x1280/landscape-1455664336-elle-fashion-week-moments-index.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/07/980x980/square-1455664336-elle-fashion-week-moments-index.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "All the Weird and Wild and Awesome Things That Happened at New York Fashion Week", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1455948720.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
