(As Kourtney claims, she was \u201casking for it.\u201d)\n\n\u201cCan we cover her with baby powder?\u201d asks Khlo\u00e9, 33.\n\n\u201cWhat if we put a blueberry up her a\u2014?\u201d suggests Kourtney, 38.\n\nWhen they run out of ideas, Kourtney asks her Twitter followers for some suggestions on how to prank a sleeping person. After skipping over the boring ones \u2014 \u201clet them rest,\u201d \u201cleave Kendall alone\u201d \u2014 one person replies with a particularly \u2026 creative response.\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s good! This one\u2019s good!\u201d Kourtney says excitedly. \u201cPut a few squares of chocolate in their bum crack so it melts, and when they wake up they think they pooped themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the winner,\u201d she continues, laughing so hard she can barely speak. \u201cShe\u2019s just going to think she went to the bathroom \u2026 She\u2019s going to think she was so drunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, Twitter is really \u2014 it\u2019s a great tool,\u201d says Khlo\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s almost better than Google because they give you in real time responses and they\u2019re really crafty.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Here\u2019s Why Kendall Jenner Is Missing from the 2017 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show Lineup\n\nKourtney then sneaks into Kendall\u2019s room with a plate of chocolate, slipping under the covers while Khlo\u00e9 films the operation \u2014 but unfortunately, Kendall, 21, wakes up before the deed is done.\n\n\u201cWe wanted you to shart yourself,\u201d explains Khlo\u00e9 as the three crack up. \u201cWe wanted to see if you would tell us if you s\u2014 yourself.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Kendall puts it best: \u201cYou guys are like, 12,\u201d she says.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
