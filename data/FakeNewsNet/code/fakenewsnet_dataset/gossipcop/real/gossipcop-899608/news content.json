We\u2019ll be updating this page with the latest news and views as they arrive\u2026\n\nWhen is The Crown season three released on Netflix?\n\nSeason three is expected to be released at some point in 2019, although Netflix has not yet confirmed an exact date, it\u2019s looking likely to be sometime in the autumn, and certainly before Christmas. Past seasons suggests a November or early December release date just in time to hunker down for a winter binge watch!\n\nWhile season one was released in November 2016 and season two in December 2017 \u2013 just in time for Christmas \u2013 Netflix was always anticipating a longer break in between series two and three due to the introduction of the brand new cast.\n\nFilming began in July 2018, and Olivia Colman confirmed at the Oscars that principal filming had finished in February 2019 \u2013 although she was still working on reshoots.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just finished season three a week ago, and when I go back I\u2019ve got to do some reshoots\u201d she said in a interview following her Oscar win on 24th February 2019. \u201cWe start again with season four in August.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good news for the future of the series, as it suggests we won\u2019t have to wait as long for season four to be released. After that however, the cast is set to change again. It is a mystery who will take on the main roles of The Queen and Prince Philip as the epic series enters much more modern history.\n\nWhat is going to happen?\n\nThe third and fourth series will span the years 1964-76, with series one and two having covered the early years of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s reign, from 1947-63.\n\nShow-runner Peter Morgan is not giving anything away just yet, but history tells us that series three, if it does indeed take us from \u201964-\u201970, will see the monarch cultivating her steadiest relationship with a Prime Minister yet in Harold Wilson, who served as head of the British government during this period.\n\nNew star Tobias Menzies revealed to RadioTimes.com that the series will include an episode on the Apollo 11 moon landing, and how Prince Philip reacted to the momentous event in history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just been shooting a really interesting episode which was all tied into the moon landings in \u201969,\u201d he revealed.\n\n\u201c[Showrunner] Peter [Morgan] has taken this angle that Philip gets very absorbed by the heroism of these men compared to what maybe he hasn\u2019t done with his own life.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the BFI & Radio Times Television Festival 2017, producer Suzanne Mackie said that the new season would also see the introduction of Charles\u2019 second wife Camilla Parker-Bowles.\n\nIt should also cover the decolonisation of Africa and the Caribbean, the birth of Prince Edward (March 1964), and Prince Charles\u2019 movement into the public eye following his coronation as the Prince of Wales in 1969.\n\nJosh O\u2019Connor, who plays the young prince, says the new series introduces Charles while he is still a student.\n\n\u201cWe start off with Charles at Cambridge University, that\u2019s where we bring him into the series,\u201d he told RadioTimes.com. \u201cThis is where we scale a significant part of his life which I feel so honoured and excited to tell the story. And tell a very different side of the story that we may not have seen or have known about.\u201d\n\nHow well do you know the history of The Crown?

Oops... you should probably go back and rewatch The Crown Which, let's face it, isn't too hard as it's great. \"History Queen\" You've certainly paid attention \u2014 are you sure you're not a member of the Royal Family? A right royal effort Not bad \u2013 but could you earn full marks before The Crown series three?\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nSadly not. However, Netflix has released a first look at Oscar-winner Olivia Colman as the Queen in the picture below.\n\nNetflix followed this up with images of another Hollywood star, Helena Bonham Carter, as Princess Margaret and Ben Daniels as Lord Snowden.\n\nA first look at Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip was released on 28th August.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nThe Queen Olivia Colman was the first new cast member announced \u2013 she will replace Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nNetflix has seemingly struck gold with the casting, especially after Colman won the Oscar for playing a different queen in 2018 film The Favourite.\n\nShe told RadioTimes.com about the moment when she knew she was in the running for the role.\n\n\u201cI got a phone call from my agent when I was in a car [telling her that she had been asked to meet with director Peter Morgan],\u201d she said. \u201cI think I had fairly recently finished watching the first series, which I think I had done in about three nights \u2013 and so I was very excited. My agent was trying to be subtle, not knowing who was in the car with me and she went, \u2018It\u2019s something about a tiara\u2019, and I went, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s The Crown!'\u201d\n\nCheck out the full interview below.\n\nShe has also warned people however that her role as Queen Elizabeth will be very different compared to her Oscar-winning performance as Queen Anne in The Favourite.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare the two. They both have the word \u2018queen\u2019 in the title but that\u2019s it, that\u2019s where it ends,\u201d she said in a post-Oscars interview with ABC.\n\n\u201cQueen Elizabeth\u2019s much harder to play. There are sort of no rules for Queen Anne: no one can say, \u2018She doesn\u2019t sound like that.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrince Philip In late March 2018, it was announced that Outlander star Tobias Menzies would be filling the role of Prince Philip, after much speculation (it was initially rumoured that Paul Bettany was in line to replace Matt Smith).\n\nExplaining how he prepared to play the Duke of Edinburgh, Menzies told RadioTimes.com, \u201cI just listened to him loads. It\u2019s partly a technical thing: you want to sound and look like him, but move like him too. I\u2019ve gone slightly crazy just listening to him and listening to him.\u201d\n\nPrincess Margaret Veteran actress Helena Bonham Carter will take on the role of Princess Margaret in series three, after Netflix confirmed the long-rumoured casting.\n\nIn January 2018, Vanessa Kirby, the actress who played Margaret in the first two series, shared an Instagram picture with Bonham Carter along with the caption \u201chonoured\u201d. She tagged The Crown\u2019s official Instagram account, too.\n\nLine of Duty star Jason Watkins meanwhile will play Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.\n\nCall the Midwife actor Erin Doherty has taken the role of Princess Anne.\n\nPrince Charles The Durrells star Josh O\u2019Connor has been confirmed as the actor to play Prince Charles in what is set to be a key period in the Prince of Wales\u2019s history. O\u2019Connor joked he had \u201cthe ears for the part\u201d.\n\nBut appearances aside, O\u2019Connor has stated that he\u2019s not looking to entirely mimic Prince Charles, stating his role in The Crown is distinct from the real-life heir to the throne.\n\n\u201cWhat [writer] Peter Morgan does is that he doesn\u2019t just present us with what we can see on YouTube. He goes behind the closed doors,\u201d he said at the BFI and Radio Times Television Festival.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ticking little things people can register and identify as Prince Charles but going beyond that and creating a full character that isn\u2019t just Prince Charles, and is something else.\u201d\n\nThe Queen Mother meanwhile will be played by Marion Bailey.\n\nIn October 2018, Netflix confirmed that Call the Midwife star Emerald Fennell would play the key role of Camilla Shand (now known as Camilla Parker-Bowles, or the Duchess of Cornwall) \u2013 Prince Charles\u2019 future wife.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely over the moon and completely terrified to be joining so many hugely talented people on The Crown,\u201d Fennell said, adding cheekily, \u201cI absolutely love Camilla, and am very grateful that my teenage years have well prepared me for playing a chain-smoking serial snogger with a pudding bowl hair cut.\u201d\n\nThe X-Files and Sex Education star Gillian Anderson meanwhile will play Margaret Thatcher.\n\nEmma Corrin will play Lady Diana Spencer (the future Princess of Wales) in The Crown.\n\n\u201cI have been glued to the show and to think I\u2019m now joining this incredibly talented acting family is surreal,\u201d Corrin said.\n\n\u201cPrincess Diana was an icon and her effect on the world remains profound and inspiring. To explore her through Peter Morgan\u2019s writing is the most exceptional opportunity and I will strive to do her justice!\u201d she added.\n\nHer new co-star O\u2019Connor later praised the casting, telling RadioTimes.com, \u201cI\u2019ve met her and I think she is young but she\u2019s totally on point. She\u2019s an incredible talent.\u201d\n\nGame of Thrones star Charles Dance will be appearing in The Crown too, although his role is as-yet unconfirmed. Rumour has it however that he will play Prince Charles\u2019 favourite great-uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten\u2026\n\nOf course, that still leaves plenty of other empty roles: we\u2019ll be keeping this page updated with the announcements as they come in.\n\nActor Alex Jennings, who played the Duke of Windsor in series one and two, has already admitted that he will find it difficult to watch his successor in the role.\n\n\u201cI would love to have been involved in my story in The Crown, to have done the whole arc up until the Duke of Windsor\u2019s end,\u201d he told RadioTimes.com.\n\nWill Princess Diana feature in The Crown season three?\n\nWhile Emma Corrin has been cast in the Netflix series, she won\u2019t make her first on-screen appearance until season four. However, with filming beginning on the fourth season, her casting was confirmed in April 2019.\n\nHow similar do the new cast of The Crown look to the actual royals?\n\nWhile Colman will be familiar to British drama fans, it\u2019s striking just how similar she appears to Queen Elizabeth II in her first official photo in costume.\n\nWith the release of the first cast images from The Crown season 3, we finally get our chance to see how this new collection of actors have transformed into their royal counterparts\u2026 Posted by Radio Times on Monday, July 23, 2018\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd she\u2019s not the only one: looking back at photos from the time, we can see that the new cast could well be very suited to their roles.
