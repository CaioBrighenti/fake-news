Outside of the Las Vegas shooting, 2017 also saw the terrorist attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester last May. In total, 81 music event attendees passed away due to violence, as Morris noted while introducing the performance. The group then performed Eric Clapton\u2019s touching song \u201cTears in Heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cLive music events have always provided a safe space for fans to gather in a shared celebration of music. Sadly, that wasn\u2019t always the case this past year,\u201d explained Neil Portnow, President/CEO of the Recording Academy, in a statement shared before the ceremony. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s incredibly important to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in these senseless tragedies and to remind musicians and music lovers alike that live music will continue to be a powerful force that unites us all.\u201d\n\nBoth Morris and Brothers Osborne were up for awards during the evening, for for Best Country Solo Performance and Best Country Duo/Group Performance, while Church is a past Grammy nominee.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "images": ["http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-maren-morris-song.jpg", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-maren-morris-song.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-maren-morris-song.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5119396/las-vegas-tribute-grammys/", "title": "Country Stars Honor Las Vegas, Manchester Victims at Grammys", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "maren morris, maren morris grammys, las vegas shooting, grammys 2018 las vegas tribute, brothers osborne, eric church, maren morris grammys vegas shooting", "news_keywords": "maren morris, maren morris grammys, las vegas shooting, grammys 2018 las vegas tribute, brothers osborne, eric church, maren morris grammys vegas shooting", "description": "Maren Morris, Brothers Osborne and Eric Church performed at the Grammys to honor victims of gun violence and terrorism at live music events.", "og": {"title": "Country Stars Sing Touching Tribute to Shooting Victims", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5119396/las-vegas-tribute-grammys/", "description": "Maren Morris, Brothers Osborne and Eric Church performed at the Grammys", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-maren-morris-song.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5119396/las-vegas-tribute-grammys/", "description": "Maren Morris, Brothers Osborne and Eric Church performed at the Grammys to honor victims of gun violence and terrorism at live music events.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-maren-morris-song.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5119396/las-vegas-tribute-grammys/", "title": "Country Stars Sing Touching Tribute to Shooting Victims", "description": "Maren Morris, Brothers Osborne and Eric Church performed at the Grammys", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-maren-morris-song.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
