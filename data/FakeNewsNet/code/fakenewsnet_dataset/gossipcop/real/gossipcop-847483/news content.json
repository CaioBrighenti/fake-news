I feel like I\u2019ve grown leaps and bounds since \u2018American Idol\u2019 just because of that \u2014 because when you start picking things apart you\u2019re like \u2018Oh, I do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWorld of Dance,\u201d which started production at the end of January and is set to air over the summer, features dancers from all over the world competing for the $1 million prize in front of judges Lopez, Ne-Yo, Derek Hough and host Jenna Dewan. This season, the show will expand the number of young competitors \u2014 with 50 percent of contestants being under the age of 18 \u2014 as well as increase the total number of dancers.\n\n\u201cLast year was such a success for us, and we were so excited about that. It really kind of exceeded all of our expectations,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI knew we had the ingredients for a beautiful show, but you never know what\u2019s going to happen, so it was just exciting to be able to come back again. And we\u2019re going to give them more of what they loved the first time.\u201d\n\nThe show was a passion project for the singer and actress, who calls dance her \u201cfirst love,\u201d and wanted to give hardworking dancers their time in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been in the background for so long, and people don\u2019t realize how much dedication, commitment, passion and love it takes to be a dancer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like any artist in the world, you have to love it, and I just love providing a platform where they get to be not a step away or a step behind but up front and the star.\u201d\n\nNe-Yo echoed a similar sentiment, saying, \u201cThe height of a lot of dancers is dancing behind somebody else, and for the amount of sacrifice and blood, sweat and tears that you have to put into it in order to become great, it was almost sad that there was no platform for these people to be the star.\u201d\n\nAs for why the show was such a success in it\u2019s first year, crowning French duo Les Twins as its winners and leading as the top new summer series, Hough says the key is \u201cjust the love, the love of dance,\u201d while Dewan thinks it\u2019s due to the uplifting message.\n\n\u201cI think when you\u2019re done with your day and [are] with your family, you want something you can watch all together and you want your popcorn \u2014 you want to be entertained and you want to feel good \u2014 and I think that\u2019s a bit of what we\u2019ve tapped into,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWorld of Dance\u201d premieres May 29 on NBC. It has also already been renewed for a third season.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hbo-chernobyl.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10331334cg-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/9245539a-cropped-e1562834428290.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/schitts-creek-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/big-little-lies-season-2-2.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/amazon-sign1.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/chloe-dan-2nd-photo.jpg?w=640&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_181390_1066.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/big-little-lies-season-2-2.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nicholsfabian.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/oscar-jaenada-shooting-hernan.jpg?crop=0px%2C283px%2C5472px%2C3084px&resize=450%2C253", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger-things.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/influencer-drama-2019-james-charles-olivia-jade-something-navy.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/st3.jpeg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/marc-guggenheim.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jakeg.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-episode-6.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2037-_toy-story-4_-cast-explains-why-forky-isne28099t-named-sporky-youtube-f09f948a.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-episode-6.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jacob-and-zach.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rexfeatures_10314204hj-e1561059816154.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lion-king.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/joker-movie-trailer-gq-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_1336603469.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mariah-carey-49-shows-off-her-tiny-waist-in-teeny-weeny-skintight-mini-dress-ftr.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fjennifer-lopez-world-of-dance-season-2-derek-hough-neyo-jenna-dewan-interview-1202682565%2F&ct=article&lob=pmc-core&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202682565&comment_count=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_181390_1066.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bethany-hamilton-unstoppable-lieber-films.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10332596bb.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/theylive1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_181390_1066.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Chuba", "Kirsten'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/jennifer-lopez-world-of-dance-season-2-derek-hough-neyo-jenna-dewan-interview-1202682565/", "title": "\u2018World of Dance\u2019 Goes Younger, Bigger For Second Season \u2013 Variety", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "The show returns with judges Jennifer Lopez, Ne-Yo, Derek Hough and host Jenna Dewan.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "news_keywords": "Derek Hough, Jenna Dewan, Jennifer Lopez, Ne-Yo, World of Dance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Says \u2018World of Dance\u2019 Is Going Younger and Bigger in Season 2", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/jennifer-lopez-world-of-dance-season-2-derek-hough-neyo-jenna-dewan-interview-1202682565/", "description": "For Jennifer Lopez, spending seven years as a judge on talent competition shows hasn\u2019t just been about mentoring young performers, but also about improving herself.
