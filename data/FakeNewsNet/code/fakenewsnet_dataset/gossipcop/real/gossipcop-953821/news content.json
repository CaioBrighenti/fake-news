So my life was this person and these movies and we broke up around the same time that I wrapped those movies.\u201d She continued: \u201cBeing 24 was this whole year of, \u2018Who am I without these movies? Who am I without this man?\u2019 \u201d\n\nHoult opened up about the situation in 2019, telling ELLE, \u201cIt\u2019s like going back to school after the summer holidays. The reality of [the X-Men franchise] is there are lots of characters, so everyone was together for brief periods, but not every day for four months.\u201d", "images":
