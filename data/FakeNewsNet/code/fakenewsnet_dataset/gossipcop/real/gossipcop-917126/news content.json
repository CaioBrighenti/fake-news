Olivia Pope has come out the worse for wear after both being shot and resigning from her role as White House Chief of Staff, but also redeemed having sacrificed herself for the president\u2019s well-being. Quinn\u2019s vendetta against Liv may have finally resolved itself, along with Olivia\u2019s relationship with her father, Rowan.\n\nBy the end of the episode, Olivia got all stitched up and drank some wine. Now the question on everyone\u2019s mind is: where will she go from here? As Rowan said last episode, \u201cThe giant has fallen, but that doesn\u2019t mean the giant is dead.\u201d In fact, the giant is heading for the Supreme Court.\n\nOlivia & Annalise\u2019s Worlds Collide\n\nThe \u201cHow to Get Away with Scandal\u201d crossover\u2019s sneak peek opened with Pope posing a question about crisis management to a college classroom. Annalise Keating of HTGAWM answered correctly, and fans had heart palpitations seeing the two meet for the first time. We learned that Annalise is seeking Olivia\u2019s help appealing her class action lawsuit in the highest court in the land.\n\nIn an interview conducted by Entertainment Weekly, Murder creator and producer Pete Nowalk gave a few interesting tidbits of information about the crossover. First, the Scandal hour of the show will feature Annalise\u2019s road trip to D.C. to meet Olivia. The Murder hour will follow the two women into the Supreme Court to argue Annalise\u2019s judicial reform suit.\n\nScandal has explored Olivia\u2019s dark side this season, while Murder\u2018s Annalise is on the road to redemption. Nowalk claims that the two are meeting at an opportune time for both of them. \u201cWhat\u2019s cool is that they can both help each other get out of this place and dig themselves out of the ditch they\u2019re both in,\u201d says Nowalk.\n\nThe trouble, it seems, will be their strong personalities. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun of the episode,\u201d according to Nowalk. \u201cThese are two really unique, strong-minded people [\u2026] but they are both working for something bigger than themselves.\u201d\n\nWorking Together for Justice\n\nAuthor Natalie Abrams also pointed to a previous issue of EW in which Shonda Rhimes had hinted at the subject of the crossover. Nowalk confirms that the hint was from former Scandal president Fitz Grant\u2019s speech about criminal justice reform. It would seem that Olivia and Annalise have always been working toward similar goals.\n\nMost importantly for fans, Nowalk says that we\u2019ll be left with \u201cthe feeling of a resolution.\u201d\n\nThe two hour crossover episode will cover both shows\u2019 time blocks, starting with Scandal at 6 p.m. EST and lasting through tonight\u2019s How to Get Away with Murder episode from 7-8 p.m. EST.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 27 44'%3E%3Cpath d='M0 22L22 0l2.1 2.1L4.2 22l19.9 19.9L22 44 0 22z' fill='%23ffffff'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-BuK7Wa2WM15M6.gif", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/secondnexus_logo_sticky.png", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/second-nexus-logo.svg", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/oh-myyy-ribbon.svg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c896c5b43fca8ab312ccb12ab56880f2?s=64&d=%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F2n-favicon-150x150.png&r=g", "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-901874896-150x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-901874896-150x150.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://secondnexus.com/entertainment/scandal-htgawm-crossover/", "title": "Tonight, How to Get Away with Scandal \u2013 3/1/2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Tonight's highly-anticipated two hour crossover between Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder comes after an action-packed episode last Thursday, with Olivia Pope coming out the worse for wear.
