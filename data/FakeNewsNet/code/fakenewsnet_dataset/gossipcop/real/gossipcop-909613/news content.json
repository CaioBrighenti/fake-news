The two talked red carpet looks and baby number two on Saturday night's Pre-Grammy Gala.\n\n\"I hope baby two is like John a lot,\" Teigen told ET's Keltie Knight on the red carpet for the Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Gala on Saturday in New York . \"Baby Luna's more like me...and I realized I can be difficult,\" she added with a laugh.\n\nBut luckily, the soon-to-be father of two isn't bothered by two Chrissys in the house.\n\n\"I'm very much in love with my wife and my daughter so if the next baby has any of their characteristics I'll be very happy,\" he said.\n\nTeigen said it can be hard to predict a baby's personality. \"Sometimes they go rogue, she said, adding, \"This one might be like the mail man, we don't know.\"\n\nChrissy shared a photo on Instagram of her look for the night, donning a gorgeous white and silver gown on the red carpet.\n\n\"Had such a wonderful time at Clive's pre-Grammy party!\" she wrote. \"I must thank my dear friends who I pay but they're still very good friends @jenatkinhair @maryphillips And @ I love you guys. Thank you for making me feel good which is more important than looking good but let's face it, both are nice. Thank you thank you @jonathansimkhai for creating such a beautiful dress for me and baby. It was such an honor to work with you.\"\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nShe then added a shot with her Grammy-award winning husband, writing, \"...and thank you to Johnny. I wouldn\u2019t be here without you. Or I would because I\u2019d be dating or married to someone similar. But I am happy to be here with you. I love you.\"\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nSee more: Chrissy Teigen's Throwback Proves She and John Legend Were Always the Coolest Couple at the Grammy Awards\n\nTeigen is expecting baby #2 in spring 2018.", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5b95aec53ce6f5474b2c9f50/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-957866438.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b4a1004d3217d0c31e01f6b/1:1/w_125/kate-upton-and-justin-verlander-wedding-kt-merry2018020819_.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5c618b4c0d9b612d39708681/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1071126782.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a6e74b3f8de1b0e26eb46fc/master/pass/GettyImages-911509776.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a6e74b3f8de1b0e26eb46fc/1:1/w_767/GettyImages-911509776.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a6e74b3f8de1b0e26eb46fc/master/pass/GettyImages-911509776.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/chrissy-teigen-and-john-legend-are-having-the-best-time-at-the-grammys", "title": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Are Having The Best Time at The Grammys", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Chrissy Teigen also revealed why she wants baby number two to turn out just like her husband, John Legend.", "og": {"description": "Teigen also revealed why she wants baby #2 to turn out just like her husband.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a6e74b3f8de1b0e26eb46fc/master/pass/GettyImages-911509776.jpg", "title": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Are Having The Most Amazing Time at the Grammys", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/chrissy-teigen-and-john-legend-are-having-the-best-time-at-the-grammys", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Teigen also revealed why she wants baby #2 to turn out just like her husband.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a6e74b3f8de1b0e26eb46fc/master/pass/GettyImages-911509776.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Are Having The Most Amazing Time at the Grammys", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/chrissy-teigen-and-john-legend-are-having-the-best-time-at-the-grammys", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "News", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
