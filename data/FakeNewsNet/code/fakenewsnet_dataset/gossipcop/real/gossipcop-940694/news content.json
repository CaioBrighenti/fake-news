You're a forever parent the minute you accept the love of that child,\" Bullock told Kotb.\n\n\"It's amazing to me how we can take away people's happiness by telling them, 'This is the box you have to stay in,'\" she said of starting a family. \"There is no box.\"\n\n.@hodakotb talked to #Oceans8 star Sandra Bullock about the film, adoption and more. Here\u2019s a sneak peek. Full interview Monday. pic.twitter.com/steMjZVrtB \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) June 1, 2018\n\nThe Ocean's 8 star adopted son Louis in 2010 and daughter Laila in 2015, while Kotb welcomed daughter Haley Joy via adoption in February 2017. Bullock described her children's personalities in the June issue of InStyle.\n\n\"Lou is super sensitive. I call him my 78-year-old son,\" the star said. \"I saw that when they handed him to me. There was a spiritual bigness to him.\"\n\n\"Laila is just unafraid,\" she added. \"She's a fighter, and that's the reason she's here today. She fought to keep her spirit intact. Oh my God, what she is going to accomplish. She's going to bring some real change.\"\n\nBullock has been dating photographer Bryan Randall since 2015. Kotb, meanwhile, shares Haley with boyfriend Joel Schiffman, and enjoyed a beach day with her family over Memorial Day weekend.", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/related/7641562765490/2/v1.2/e35c017ccbc056d1fff2d90614170088/upi/Beyonce-Donald-Glover-attend-The-Lion-King-premiere.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/expand_gallery.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15071286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4621562907259/2019/upi/24864105aebfdedab071cd61925fb4dc/v1.5/R-Kelly-faces-federal-kidnapping-child-sex-racketeering-charges.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7191562865263/2019/upi/dd7c8c20a88724f042688075dfb2e55c/v1.5/Christine-Baranskis-Good-Fight-moves-from-streaming-to-network.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4691562947708/2019/upi/93608c5b7949951fad4700562606e8f1/v1.5/Oprah-Winfrey-opens-private-road-to-help-Maui-fire-evacuations.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2211562518286/2019/upi/c81a68a1a9a765aae722442766e0e2c0/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-July-12-Michelle-Rodriguez-Malala-Yousafzai.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3181562849796/2019/upi/36d4ca61fb09350bdaaa89535b3155aa/v1.5/Real-Housewives-alum-Gretchen-Rossi-gives-birth-to-daughter.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/1601527859522/2018/1/253428646c082afc84408f2dfbb16093/Sandra-Bullock-tears-up-while-discussing-adoption-with-Hoda-Kotb.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-hqtKxhsRLFLuJ.gif", "https://www.upi.com/upi/dw/img/clear.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/1601527859522/2018/1/253428646c082afc84408f2dfbb16093/v1.5/Sandra-Bullock-tears-up-while-discussing-adoption-with-Hoda-Kotb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/1601527859522/2018/1/253428646c082afc84408f2dfbb16093/v1.5/Sandra-Bullock-tears-up-while-discussing-adoption-with-Hoda-Kotb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2018/06/01/Sandra-Bullock-tears-up-while-discussing-adoption-with-Hoda-Kotb/1601527859522/", "title": "Sandra Bullock tears up while discussing adoption with Hoda Kotb", "meta_data": {"description": "\"Ocean's 8\" star Sandra Bullock gets emotional on \"Today\" while describing her role as a \"forever parent.\"", "keywords": "Entertainment, Sandra Bullock", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Sandra Bullock", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "\"Ocean's 8\" star Sandra Bullock gets emotional on \"Today\" while describing her role as a \"forever parent.\"", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2018/06/01/Sandra-Bullock-tears-up-while-discussing-adoption-with-Hoda-Kotb/1601527859522/", "title": "Sandra Bullock tears up while discussing adoption with Hoda Kotb", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/1601527859522/2018/3/1b449e260915f48a9658770bc9d8800c/v1.5/Sandra-Bullock-tears-up-while-discussing-adoption-with-Hoda-Kotb.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 400}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "creator": "@littlemannie", "title": "Sandra Bullock tears up while discussing adoption with Hoda Kotb", "description": "\"Ocean's 8\" star Sandra Bullock gets emotional on \"Today\" while describing her role as a \"forever parent.\"", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1601527859522/2018/upi/253428646c082afc84408f2dfbb16093/v2.1/Sandra-Bullock-tears-up-while-discussing-adoption-with-Hoda-Kotb.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
