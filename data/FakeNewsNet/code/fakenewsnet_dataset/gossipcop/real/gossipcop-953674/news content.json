Bendjima, 25, left a playful comment on his girlfriend\u2019s Instagram post after receiving backlash for criticizing her sexy snaps.\n\n\u201cHmmm well\u2026 ok for this one,\u201d Bendjima commented alongside an emoji with its tongue sticking out.\n\nAfter Kardashian\u2019s close friend Simon Huck replied to his comment with an eye-roll emoji, Bendjima did his best to clear the air and explain his joke.\n\n\u201cLet me just play around fam,\u201d he wrote.\n\nImage zoom Kourtney Kardashian/Instagram\n\nImage zoom Kourtney Kardashian/Instagram\n\nThe comment comes days after Kardashian posted a photo of herself posing in a thong bikini, which Bendjima reportedly dissed in a since-deleted comment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you need to show to get likes?\u201d he commented according to TMZ.\n\nBut while Bendjima insists his comments are jokes, a source told PEOPLE he has never been a fan of his girlfriend\u2019s revealing shots.\n\n\u201cHe never liked that she posted sexy pictures of herself on social media,\u201d said the source. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want his girlfriend to do that. He gets that it\u2019s her job, but wants her to post more covered up pictures.\u201d\n\nThe mother of three recently returned from an extravagant European vacation that she spent with her boyfriend and her three children with ex Scott Disick: Mason, 8, Reign, 3, and Penelope, 5.\n\nDuring the three-week trip, Kardashian traveled around Italy and posted multiple photos on Instagram showing off her toned physique in bathing suits, including two photos of her eating bread in a bikini while on a yacht.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Strike a Pose!

Ever since, they\u2019ve enjoyed several trips to luxe locations, from St. Tropez to Egypt, and their blossoming romance was documented on the most recent season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nIn December, a source told PEOPLE things between Kardashian and Bendjima are \u201cdefinitely serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one thought their relationship would last this long, but Kourtney is very happy,\u201d said the insider. \u201cYounes has met her kids. Kourtney\u2019s family really likes him. He\u2019s the opposite of Scott. He doesn\u2019t party, isn\u2019t flashy and really treats Kourtney with a lot of respect. It\u2019s obvious that he really cares about her.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kourtney-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1300px%2C683px&resize=1200%2C630",
