Karwai Tang/Getty Images\n\nThe first Monday in May hosts the party of the year in the fashion world.\n\nDubbed the Oscars of the East, the Met Gala themed \" Camp: Notes on Fashion,\" took place on May 6, celebrating the Metropolitan Museum of Art's newest exhibition at the Costume Institute.\n\nWith 200 pieces on display, featuring high-end designers from Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld to John Galliano and Virgil Abloh, the exhibition focuses on exaggerated fashion. \"Camp fashion can be humorous, ironic, or simply extreme in its nature,\" wrote Lauren Alexis Fisher for Harper's Bazaar.\n\nHelmed by Vogue's Anna Wintour (and co-chaired this year by Lady Gaga, Harry Styles, Gucci's Alessandro Michele, and Serena Williams), the Met Gala is known for its best-dressed and worst-dressed celebrities, socialites, and businesspeople who walk the red carpet in their interpretation of the theme.\n\nAnyone who is anyone is there, at least according to Wintour's handpicked and closely scrutinized guest list.\n\nThis year's guests' outfits didn't disappoint, from Billy Porter's 24-karat gold headpiece to Lady Gaga's four outfit changes.\n\nThe cost to make an appearance during fashion's biggest night out is a steep one, and the cost to make the event happen is even bigger. For a reported $30,000 per ticket, those who passed Wintour's approval can attend the roughly $3.5 million event.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning of all the money that goes into \u2014 and comes out of \u2014 what Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley refers to as \"the Super Bowl of fashion.\"\n\nTake an inside look at the money behind the Met Gala.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cd186a1021b4c6a5d7e62c5-750-562.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cd198a7021b4c76684bea67-1920-960.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5cd198a7021b4c76684bea67-1920-960.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/met-gala-2018-theme-cost-ticket-dress-jewlery-2018-5", "title": "$30,000 tickets, $2 million jewelry, and $2,000 tuxedos: Unbelievable facts show just how opulent the Met Gala is", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2019-05-07", "sailthru.date": "2019-05-07", "news_keywords": "Features, Met Gala, Celebrities, Fashion, Anna Wintour, Arts & Culture, BI Select, Hillary Hoffower", "sailthru.tags": "Features, Met Gala, Celebrities, Fashion, Anna Wintour, Arts & Culture, BI Select, Hillary Hoffower", "description": "The Met Gala 2019, themed \"Camp: Notes on Fashion,\" took place on May 6.
