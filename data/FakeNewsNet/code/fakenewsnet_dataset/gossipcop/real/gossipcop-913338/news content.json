But the ladies who attended were sure fun to watch anyway in the latest RHOA episode.\n\nPorsha\u2019s party started with shots on the patio, and a plant-based menu followed afterwards. This definitely led to some drunken fun.\n\nCynthia Bailey invited the gang to a trip to Barcelona and Porsha admitted that there is much more going on than RHOA producers let fans to see.\n\nShe said that her dinner was not filled with beef but on the other hand, \u2018it was beef all around that table.\u2019\n\n\u2018The audience didn\u2019t even get to see a majority of it because, as you can tell, we were on fire that night. The dinner was long. They had to edit it down to what you saw, and it still was on fire. It was fun\u2019 said Porsha.\n\n\u2018And you know what I liked about it? It was kind of back to how it used to be on Housewives to where we may disagree, and it may get a little heated, and we may read or whatever, but then five minutes later, when we walked inside, we were better again. It was just a good time. I liked it\u2019 Porsha continued.\n\nThen, Porsha told her fans that she and Cynthia discussed her feelings about the fact that everyone disses Will. Kim Zolciak wanted to bring her hubby Kroy Bierman to the trip to Barcelona, and all the ladies protested against her plan.\n\nPorsha also said that there were some crazy moments indeed at that dinner and she motivated this saying that the ladies \u2018didn\u2019t have meat, they didn\u2019t have the bread they would typically have. They had strictly a whole plant-based meal, so they weren\u2019t used to that. So whatever I was giving them had them lit.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see what will happen during the ladies\u2019 trip to Barcelona at this end of this week, Stay tuned for more juicy RHOA!", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AlexisStone-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Check-Out-RHOAs-Porsha-Williams-Revealing-What-Fans-Didnt-See-At-Her-Vegan-Dinner-Party.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/43985529_523898401412209_5123552859810577444_n-240x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Keyshia-Cole-Fashion-1-300x244.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kim-Zolciak-Biermann-Husband-Kroy-Biermann-Leave-Atlanta-For-A-Getaway-To-A-Tropical-Destination-Kim-Shares-Topless-Pic-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/RHOA-Porsha-Williams-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kenya-Moore-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dish-110813-kandi-burruss-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lady-gaga-2-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/dish-110813-kandi-burruss-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Check-Out-RHOAs-Porsha-Williams-Revealing-What-Fans-Didnt-See-At-Her-Vegan-Dinner-Party.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexis Stone", "Charisse Van Horn", "Lynn Gintonio", "Ann Mose", "Gloria Meredith"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/check-out-rhoas-porsha-williams-revealing-what-fans-didnt-see-at-her-vegan-dinner-party-114877/", "title": "Check Out RHOA\u2019s Porsha Williams Revealing What Fans Didn\u2019t See At Her Vegan Dinner Party", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Alexis Stone", "news_keywords": "cynthia bailey, kim zolciak, porsha williams, rhoa,", "keywords": "celebrity news, cynthia bailey, kim zolciak, porsha williams, rhoa,", "description": "Porsha Williams' vegan feast was not quite a dinner from hell as lots of fans might have expected.
