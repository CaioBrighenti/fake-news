I think it's important to speak out and not be shamed by anyone,\" she said on the show. \"It is not always easy, but we have to do that. That is why I posted and I will say it right now out loud\u2014me too. \"This is not a male thing or a female thing. It is not a Hollywood thing or a political thing. This is a human thing. And it happens in the workplace, it happens in families, it happens all over the world, and we are all the same. We all want the same thing\u2014we want respect and love and kindness. And if I could have those three things\u2014and a new iPhone 10\u2014I would be complete.\"\n\nDeGeneres went on to muse about how the phrase \"me too\" now carries a weight it did not before.\n\n\"I'm not sure about the etiquette, but I do know that hell hath no fury like a woman with a Twitter account. So, you have to be careful about what you tweet, because if you see a tweet that says, 'I can't wait to see the new Star Wars movie' and then you respond, 'Me too,' it means something completely different now,\" she teased. \"So, you're going to have to find another way to say, 'I also' or 'Me as well' or 'Ditto' or 'Samesies' or something like that. And if you really do want to see the Star Wars movie and you've been sexually harassed, you can respond, 'Me too, me too.' You know?\"\n\nTake a look at the clip, below:", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1586530151593576&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.out.com/sites/all/modules/custom/heremedia_fb/images/twitter-share-button.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/2019/07/12/transmilitarybanx750.jpg?itok=PuHQ8IhB&timestamp=1562951605", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/2019/05/23/out_285_june_july_buttigieg_sm.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/intgm-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/search.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/tw-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/logo.png", "https://www.out.com/sites/all/modules/custom/heremedia_fb/images/facebook-share-button.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/2019/07/12/layshiaclarendon.jpg?itok=vQmfMUnx&timestamp=1562938824", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/2019/07/11/some-kidx750.jpg?itok=MkQelasZ&timestamp=1562870177", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-99s4-uKAk3J7g.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/2019/07/11/dating-appx750.jpg?itok=tCXzSCQd&timestamp=1562875394", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/Out-Logo300x107.svg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/2019/07/12/billyporterx750.jpg?itok=f6jUcLC4&timestamp=1562969268", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/2019/07/12/anjelica-ross-hand-upx750.jpg?itok=Ku6d1_PQ&timestamp=1562935294", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/2019/07/11/jeremy-o-harris-by-matthew-leifhelt750x.jpg?itok=H7WgKi94&timestamp=1562870510", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/fb-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/tumblr-Out.png", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/mail-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/2016/10/25/ellen-750x563.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=259124211325942&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/2016/10/25/ellen-750x563.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.out.com/popnography/2017/10/19/ellen-degeneres-adds-her-voice-metoo-movement", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Adds Her Voice to the #MeToo Movement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Out", "fb": {"app_id": 705953026218815, "page_id": 19799718480, "pages": 19799718480}, "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "description": "\"This is not a male thing or a female thing.
