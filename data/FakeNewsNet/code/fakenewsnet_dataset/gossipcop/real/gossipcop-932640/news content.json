I just think that it\u2019s really important for me to be there for them, and even though I want to go away and travel and do things for myself, it\u2019s hard to find the balance of allowing myself to do that and not feel guilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely learned from my past relationship, where I really wouldn\u2019t travel without the kids and I think it is important to take time \u2014 especially because my relationship is important to me and those worlds aren\u2019t colliding right now \u2014 just making sure that I make time for both,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think going on a trip once in a while reminds me the importance of being present and in the moment when I\u2019m at home, and I think it makes me the best mom that I can be.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty\n\nA source previously told PEOPLE in December that things between Kardashian and Bendjima, who were first introduced during a trip to Paris in October 2016, are \u201cdefinitely serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one thought their relationship would last this long, but Kourtney is very happy,\u201d remarked the insider. \u201cYounes has met her kids. Kourtney\u2019s family really likes him. He\u2019s the opposite of Scott. He doesn\u2019t party, isn\u2019t flashy and really treats Kourtney with a lot of respect. It\u2019s obvious that he really cares about her.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/nikki-bella-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630",
