From their favorite perks to the crazy drama, Shantel Jackson, Asiah Collins and Alycia Bella tease what fans can expect from their all-new show.\n\nMORE: Nelly Talks Tour Life, Keeping Music 'Fresh' & What Makes His Girlfriend Stand Out From the Rest (Exclusive)\n\nShantel Jackson\n\nView photos Photo: E! More\n\nShe's sweet, confident and an all-around awesome support system for her boyfriend, Nelly, whom she's been dating for three and a half years. While chatting with ET, Shantel recalled the exact moment she and Nelly met, and the qualities she loves about him.\n\n\n\n\"Nelly and I actually met through a mutual friend of ours and I was so honestly hell-bent on, 'No, I don't think I want to get into another relationship right now or date another celebrity,'\" said Shantel, who previously dated Floyd Mayweather. \"He kept pressing our mutual friend like, 'Just tell her to come chill with me at the studio, I just want to meet her.' I ended up just giving in one day, and honestly, we've been inseparable ever since.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm always proud of him,\" she continued. \"I love the way he treats his family, he takes care of his mother, he takes care of his father. Family is really important to him and it's really important to me as well. We're also both adventurous, outdoorsy. He makes me laugh, which is really important. We can be around each other non-stop and not be at each other\u2019s throats like, 'Oh my gosh, I gotta get away from you.' I really enjoy that\u2026 I enjoy his company.\"\n\n\n\nWhen she's not by Nelly's side, Shantel loves hanging out with her girlfriends and working on her own business ventures. She tells ET that the show will be a mix of all the glitz and glamour, the partying, the drama and an inside look at what goes on behind the scenes.\n\n\n\n\"All of that is our lives,\" she explained. \"We do party, we do get to see the concerts that we want to see, we get to watch our men perform. Of course, we are around these other women in the circle and all of us are not going to agree on everything -- [it's natural] to bump heads with someone along the lines and that\u2019s real life.\"\n\n\n\n\"But even if we're in disagreements one day, I think we still find common ground,\" she added. \"We respect each other enough to not have to throw drinks or throw hands. Keep it cute, classy and catty.\"\n\nAsiah Collins\n\nView photos Photo: E!
