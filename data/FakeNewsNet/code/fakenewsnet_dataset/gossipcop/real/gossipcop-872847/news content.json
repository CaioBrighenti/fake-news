Noted as the hottest and most unwholesome time of the year; usually July 3 to Aug. 11, but variously calculated, depending on latitude and on whether the greater Dog-star (Sirius) or the lesser one (Procyon) is reckoned.\n\nThe heliacal rising of Sirius has shifted down the calendar with the precession of the equinoxes; in ancient Egypt c.3000 B.C.E. it coincided with the summer solstice, which also was the new year and the beginning of the inundation of the Nile. The \"dog\" association apparently began here (the star's hieroglyph was a dog), but the reasons for it are obscure.", "images": ["https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1000x700-empathy-vs-sympathy-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1000x700-trending-words-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/assets/dictionary_logo_white-90c1e2eaf84c6abcb80d08d6eb0b6c60.svg", "https://www.dictionary.com/assets/dictionary-social-logo-a60fa43a7f4c5e78893e1b228bdc74b3.png", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/congratulations_1000x700-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1000x700-kangaroo-1-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/229_Synesthesia-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Alexander-Hamilton-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ie-eg-video_v3-1000x700-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1000x700-german-1-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1000x700-quotes-modern-books-1-150x150.jpg", "https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1000x700-infamous-notorious-150x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.dictionary.com/assets/dictionary-social-logo-a60fa43a7f4c5e78893e1b228bdc74b3.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dog-days", "title": "Definition of Dog days at Dictionary.com", "meta_data": {"description": "Dog days definition, the sultry part of the summer, supposed to occur during the period that Sirius, the Dog Star, rises at the same time as the sun: now often reckoned from July 3 to August 11.
