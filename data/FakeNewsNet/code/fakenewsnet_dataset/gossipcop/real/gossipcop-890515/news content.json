You\u2019ve never looked better,\u201d Guthrie, 45, told her co-anchor.\n\nImage zoom NBC/Twitter\n\nRELATED: The Today Show Crew\u2019s Greatest Halloween Costumes\n\nOver at ABC, the GMA gang threw a superhero-heavy show, with Robin Roberts showing up to save the day as Wonder Woman, Amy Robach as Spiderman, Lara Spencer as Black Widow, George Stephanopoulos as Clark Kent (a.k.a Superman) and last but not least, Michael Strahan as Thor with a giant hammer and long, tumbling blonde locks.\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom\n\n\"If Marvel and DC can get together, we can solve all of the problems in the world!\" \u2013 @MarkRuffalo \ud83d\ude02#HalloweenOnGMA pic.twitter.com/BZPUIuSbEJ \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) October 31, 2017\n\nThe best part? The real Hulk \u2014 a.k.a. Mark Ruffalo \u2014 showed up, too.\n\n\u201cWe are truly witnessing history with all of these superheroes in one place,\u201d quipped Sara Haines. \u201cThank you for bringing justice to New
