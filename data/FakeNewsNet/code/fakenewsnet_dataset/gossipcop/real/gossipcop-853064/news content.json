Some were quick to criticise her stance.\n\nImage copyright @makhondlovu\n\nImage copyright @mollie64438390\n\nImage copyright @KEE_LYme_pie\n\nMiss McCullough - who was born in Italy and was representing Washington DC - was also asked if she considered herself to be a feminist but said she preferred the term \"equalism\" and said men and women had equal opportunity in US workplaces.\n\n\"I don't really want to consider myself - try not to consider myself like this die-hard, you know, like, 'Oh, I don't really care about men',\" said the contestant, who says she wants to see more women employed in government science roles.\n\nSome people on social media supported her views.\n\nImage copyright @maryannemercog\n\nImage copyright @josie_terry\n\nImage copyright @cross_bearer89\n\nObamacare has been opposed by Republicans since it was first proposed in 2009.\n\nRepublicans say the law imposes too many costs on business and describe it as a \"job killer\", although the number of jobs in the healthcare sector has risen since it was introduced.\n\nOpponents have also decried it as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/136F6/production/_96060697_mediaitem96060696.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=world::us_and_canada::news.world.us_and_canada.story.39922784.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:c3d958eb-c58c-db41-a0ea-b5866fa49a0c]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-0.9.1-nojs]&x10=[NEWS_GNL]&x11=[NEWS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/136F6/production/_96060697_mediaitem96060696.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/136F6/production/_96060697_mediaitem96060696.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39922784", "title": "Miss USA Kara McCullough criticised for saying healthcare a 'privilege'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Kara McCullough, a nuclear scientist, appeared to link healthcare to employment.", "x-country": "us", "x-audience": "US", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "US", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 137923998, "og": {"title": "Miss USA in healthcare 'privilege' row", "type": "article", "description": "Kara McCullough, a nuclear scientist, appeared to link healthcare to employment.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39922784", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/136F6/production/_96060697_mediaitem96060696.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
