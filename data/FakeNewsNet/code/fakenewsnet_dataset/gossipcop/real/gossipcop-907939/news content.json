All three lovely ladies rocked a nearly identical shade of cobalt.\n\n\"Oh and this was NOT planned,\" Moore clarified on Instagram on Monday. \"The Pearson ladies all showed in the same shade of blue by pure coincidence. I love my fearless, gorgeous, wildly talented sisters, @susankelechiwatson and @chrissymetzand couldn\u2019t have been more honored to have matched them last night. Celebrating with our whooooooooole cast was pure magic. And a special shoutout to our patriarch and the best tv hubby and friend a lady could ever have, @miloanthonyventimiglia for speaking so eloquently on our behalf.\"\n\nMoore, who was nominated for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama series, shimmered in a slinky, custom Ralph Lauren embroidered sequined slip dress, which she paired with a black Judith Leiber clutch, Niwaka jewelry and Jimmy Choo heels.\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images for Turner Image\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nWatson upped the drama, shining in a strapless, sculptural electric blue Rubin Singer gown that featured an asymmetrical neckline, gathered skirt and knee-high slit. She accessorized with a Tyler Ellis clutch, AMP Monaco jewels and metallic peep-toe Nicholas Kirkwood heels, and she went for old Hollywood drama with her loose waves and bold red lip.\n\nFrederick M. Brown/Getty Images\n\nAs for Metz, she opted for a playful, cap-sleeve custom Kate Spade New York number that featured a ruffled neckline and skirt, as well as embroidered flowers. She topped off her look with a chic updo and plum lip, adding a little sparkle with teardrop diamond earrings and a diamond ring set by Forevermark.\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images for Turner Image\n\nThe trio apparently hadn't planned their coordinated attire, however. Moore, 33, documented the entire night on her Instagram Story, and during the show, she shared just how surprised she was to match her co-stars.\n\n\n\n\"We're at the SAG [Awards], and we're all in the same color,\" the 33-year-old actress said in a video that panned over all three outfits.\n\n\n\n\"We did not plan it!\" Watson, 36, chimed in.\n\n\n\n\"We're all on the same page,\" Moore concluded.\n\nIt was a big night for not just the three main women of This Is Us but the entire cast. The beloved NBC drama took home the award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series, while Sterling K. Brown scored The Actor for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series, making him the first black actor to even win in the category.\n\nTo find out more about the show's two wins, watch the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMandy Moore, Kristen Bell & More Best Dressed at 2018 SAG Awards\n\nThe Best Moments of the SAG Awards 2018\n\nMandy Moore Says Her Wedding Will Be An 'Elevated House Party,' Reveals Her 3 Must-Haves (Exclusive)", "images": ["https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/13/angels%20mound%20skaggs%20jerseys%207-12-19_1563018831585.jpg_22100129_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/13/new%20orleans%20sandbags%20barry%20prep%207-12-19_1563017114983.jpg_22099932_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/12/Barry%20Track_1562986442649.JPG_22098991_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/05/22/Big%20Rivers%20Waterpark%20_AMP_%20Adventures_1558546634479.jpg_21884984_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/12/acevedo-gonzalez_1562948261390_22097528_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-908529880.jpg?itok=mEeOG29_", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/12/Barry%20Track_1562986442649.JPG_22098991_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/12/10P%20P%20MISSING%20KID%20STRAT_KPRC6047_1562981621874.jpg_22098786_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "https://sharedmedia.grahamdigital.com/photo/2018/01/22/gettyimages-908529880_11517444_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-908495390.jpg?itok=8qe6Gbhj", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/13/6a%20v%20pitch%20five%20-%20BABY%20_KPRC605E_1563023346421.jpg_22100239_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "https://sharedmedia.grahamdigital.com/photo/2019/07/12/Chick-fil-A%20tire%20change_1562965301958.jpg.jpg.jpg_22098367_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "https://sharedmedia.grahamdigital.com/photo/2019/07/13/S111736374-300_20190713140034_22099868_ver1.0_160_90.JPG", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/13/6a%20v%20pitch%20five%20-%20BABY%20_KPRC605E_1563023346421.jpg_22100239_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/13/new%20orleans%20sandbags%20barry%20prep%207-12-19_1563017114983.jpg_22099932_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/07/12/10P%20P%20MISSING%20KID%20STRAT_KPRC6047_1562981621874.jpg_22098786_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "https://media.click2houston.com/photo/2019/05/22/Big%20Rivers%20Waterpark%20_AMP_%20Adventures_1558546634479.jpg_21884984_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-01/mandy_moore_getty908498768.jpg?itok=anEkuku4", "http://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-01/chrissy_metz_getty908480322.jpg?itok=vxMBtasH"], "top_img": "https://sharedmedia.grahamdigital.com/photo/2018/01/22/gettyimages-908529880_11517444_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.click2houston.com/entertainment-tonight/this-is-us-costars-mandy-moore-chrissy-metz-and-susan-kelechi-watson-rock-same-blue-hue-to-sag", "title": "Mandy Moore Says Matching Blue Dresses With 'This Is Us' Co-Stars at SAG Awards Was (Somehow) Not", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Great minds think alike!
