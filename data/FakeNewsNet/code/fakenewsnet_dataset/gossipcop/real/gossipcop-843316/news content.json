A similar take on Wednesday would lift the movie over the $1 billion mark.\n\nChina is the top foreign market with $85.3 million, followed by the U.K. with $75.3 million, Brazil with $36.7 million, and South Korea with $34.3 million. Japan is the lone market left to open with an April 21 launch.\n\nDisney-Lucasfilm\u2019s \u201cRogue One: A Star Wars Story\u201d was the most recent film to hit $1 billion worldwide. Fox\u2019s \u201cLogan\u201d is 2017\u2019s second largest worldwide grosser at $597 million, followed by Warner Bros.-Legendary\u2019s \u201cKong: Skull Island\u201d at $535 million.\n\nDisney spent $160 million making the movie, directed by Bill Condon. The cast includes Emma Watson as Belle and \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d alum Dan Stevens as her cursed love interest. Luke Evans, Kevin Kline, Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Audra McDonald, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Ian McKellen, and Emma Thompson round out the star-studded cast.\n\nThe $174.8 million opening weekend for \u201cBeauty\u201d set a record as the best domestic March launch, topping \u201cBatman v Superman\u201d and solidifying Disney\u2019s status as the current dominant player in the film business.",
