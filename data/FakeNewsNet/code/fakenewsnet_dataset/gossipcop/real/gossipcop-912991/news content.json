Gus Kenworthy returned home from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, with a litter of puppies, and he plans to adopt again while in PyeongChang, South Korea, for the 2018 Games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m visiting a dog farm with the Humane Society International on the 23rd,\u201d the freestyle skier and Head & Shoulders ambassador, 26, tells Us Weekly exclusively. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely I\u2019ll bring one back with me.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, Kenworthy and his then-boyfriend, Robin Macdonald, stayed behind in Sochi for more than a month after the Olympics ended so that the athlete could rescue four stray puppies and their mother, in addition to arranging kennels and vaccinations. One dog died before the couple left Sochi, and another died shortly after arriving in New York City.\n\nSince then, the Colorado native and his mother, Pip, have continued to care for the momma dog, Mamuchka, while pups Jake and Mishka live with Macdonald in Vancouver.\n\n\u201cMy mom likes the dog more than my brothers, and so I\u2019ve been replaced,\u201d Kenworthy previously told Us. \u201cBut it\u2019s good. They love each other and it\u2019s nice. \u2026 To me, having a dog is having a best friend. It\u2019s having a loyal and faithful companion that\u2019s by your side no matter what.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about Kenworthy, visit teamusa.org.
