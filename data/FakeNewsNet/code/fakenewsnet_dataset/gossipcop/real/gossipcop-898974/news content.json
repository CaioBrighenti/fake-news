He is often referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" or simply \"the King\" ( the latter in particular something he publicly felt was not warranted) and is the best-selling individual recording artist of all time. He was of Cherokee Native American, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Northern Irish (Scottish-Irish) and Scottish descent.\n\nQuotes [ edit ]\n\nThe first time that I appeared on stage, it scared me to death.

So every dream I ever dreamed, has come true a hundred times...

One time I called a relative in Tupelo. It was Christmas and they were havin' dinner. I asked, 'What?' and she was kind of quiet, then said, 'Meat loaf.' I was shocked as we'd had the best, you know, turkey, ham, steak, everything. She said that it was near the first and they'd run out of money so they just had meat loaf. It hurt me. and so, I ate meat loaf for about eight months, every night, so I'd remember where I came from and to remind me of how many people were unable to have what I did.

Gary Abernathy, contributor for the Washington Post, in an article dated 20 November 2018, and entitled \"Trump honoring Elvis? It's about time\", in reference to Elvis' being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in a ceremony held at the East Room in the White House, on November 16, 2018\n\n\n\nSongwriter Earl Brown was tapped to create a special finale song that reflected Elvis\u2019 emotions about the social upheaval of the time. According to the show's director Steve Binder, the resulting song, \u201cIf I Can Dream,\u201d was recorded with Elvis in the dark, almost in a fetal position, writhing on top of the studio's cement floor. And when he got done, Elvis came in the control room and asked for the song to be played more than a dozen times. Later, Binder also crafted a gospel segment populated with racially diverse singers and dancers, which he knew would spotlight the Southern-born Presley\u2019s disdain for prejudice. Fittingly, it was the highest-rated TV special of 1968 and signalled the rebirth of Elvis\u2019s career.

His range was incredible high, or low and he could croon. His impact on me was his love of African American music. Yolanda Adam, in a filmed interview for Gracelancom\n\n\n\nI am reminded of a comment made shortly after the death of Elvis Presley by a musician he had worked with. He pointed out that despite an impressive vocal range of two and a half octaves and something approaching perfect pitch, Elvis was totally willing to sing off-key when he thought the song required it. Those off-key notes were art. Patrick H.

The 33mm 18-karat white gold manually wound watch features a bezel set with 44 brilliant cut diamonds. The caseback features the engraving: \u201cTo Elvis, 75 Million Records, RCA Victor, 12-25-60. We were in on the bidding for that watch, which, according to our man there, Petros Protopapas, was very intense, with several watch collectors and Elvis collectors in on it. It was the most anyone at Omega had ever authorized to put a bid in for, and ultimately we garnered the piece at a hammer price of $1.8 million with buyers\u2019 fees and premiums. In fact, we could have secretly bid on it, but we wanted people to know that it was us bidding for it and why we were doing it as this is an important part of our past and it should not be locked in a safe, but in our Museum, so we can shared it with the world.

I was so dreadful it embarrasses me even now to think about it. Music was always a passion growing up, like I used to translate Elvis Presley songs into Russian and sing them at home. Now that I\u2019ve had a few multiplatinum albums in Russia, I want to have a go at Ireland, the UK and the rest of Europe. My heroes were Elvis, Elvis and Elvis! One of my favourite Elvis songs is My Boy, and now that I have been told that it was written by an Irishman [Phil Coulter] I love it even more. Emin Agalarov, singer and businessman, son of Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, in an article published in the USA Today affiliated North New Jersey's July 13, 2017 online edition, as well as following an interview published in the Irish Times\u032a March 22, 2015 edition.\n\n\n\nIt must have been in January of 1958 when I went to a record store to buy a 45rpm single for my older sister's birthday. I was 8 years old. When I got there, I asked if they had \"Wake up little Suzie\" by the Everly Brothers, a song she had told me was her favourite of those then playing on Mexican radios. They did, and just as it was being wrapped up the salesperson told me that there was a special, if I bought another. I asked which one should I get and he said, \"Of course, anything by Elvis\". So, inspite of never having heard of Elvis, I got the \"two for one\" special and headed back home. When my sister arrived from school I gave the Everly's record to her, \"two weeks in advance\" I said, but only as long as she allowed me to play the one I had bought for free. It was \"Dont be cruel\" with \"Hound Dog\" on the B side. The moment I heard the A side, that was it... Enrique Sealtiel Alatriste y Lozano, Mexican writer, promoter and diplomat, in his article, \"Elvis Presley\u02d0 An out of time obituary\", as published in la Revista de la UNAM. His timing was suberb, as in less than 12 months, in June of 1959, there would be no Elvis records to be found in Mexican stores, as the second of his many bans there began to exceuted by the Government authorities.\n\n\n\nHe was an extraordinary figure of his and our time, his legacy tremendous in terms of the music he created, his films, and as an entertainment personality. The generosity that he showed toward others is simply remarkable and I think it's these aspects of his character, his persona, that make him such a special person. Albert II, Prince of Monaco, after his visit to Graceland on August 7, 2010 as noted by EPE.\n\n\n\nIn an era when radio stations refused to play Chuck Berry songs, calling it \u201crace music\u201d, Elvis broke down barriers. Janet Albrechtsen, Australian columnist, in an article entitled \"Beware mob rule in the new racism\" published in The Australian on 23 November 2017.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve kind of been infatuated with Elvis since I was a kid, just always watching documentaries and stuff on him. It had a little bit to do with that and, honestly, I just wanted him to have something that wasn\u2019t very common. Jason Aldean, explaining why he and his wife named their first son Memphis, as published on Soundslike Nashville on September 30, 2017.\n\n\n\nI remember we were in his bathroom, he took my hand, asked me to sit down in a black leather chair, said some beautiful things and then he asked me to marry him. Ginger Alden, who found Elvis lifeless in the main bathroom at Graceland, six weeks after he asked her to marry him in that same bathroom, in an interview for CBS aired in 1982.\n\n\n\nWhen Elvis Presley died, he left a worldwide legion of music fans in mourning. It was no different on Long Island, where he had been scheduled to perform at the Nassau Coliseum a week later. As many as 700 fans had camped out overnight to buy tickets to the concert, which sold out quickly. On Aug. 22, the night the concert had been scheduled, over 5,000 fans gathered in the Coliseum parking lot for an impromptu tribute to Elvis that lasted two hours. Of the 16,700 tickets that had been sold, only 1,250 were returned for refund.... Michael Alexander, quoting an Editor's note of a Newsday story originally published on Aug. 17, 1977.\n\n\n\nTo host a Warhol show in a Hollywood Regency home felt like such an incredible opportunity, so when we were presented with it, we jumped at the chance. Given Warhol\u2019s fascination with Elvis, it was like this incredible opportunity to reenergize the home with the ghosts of the past in a supercool way. Part of what we love at the Future Perfect in general is the possibility to create that social interaction with the work that we present, because it completely changes the psychology of how you view it.\u201d David Alhadeff, founder of Future Perfect, a design gallery one of whose Los Angeles locations is at Elvis former home at the Trousdale Estates, now known as Casa Perfect, in an article published at Vogue Fashion's February 20,2019 edition.\n\n\n\nLet us remember that Elvis\u2019s style \u2014 which often included all-leather outfits and flashy jumpsuits \u2014 was also controversial for its mid-century time period. So, is Post Malone truly our modern-day Presley? Judging by his care-free attitude and penchant for leather Cuban heeled boots \u2014another, Presley favorite\u2014the verdict would appear to be yes. Cristian Allaire, for Vogue Magazine, in an article entitled \"Is Post Malone the new Elvis Presley of today\u031e?\",as published on December 2, 2018\n\n\n\nI was standing in the hallway, just before the show, and one of the managers told him there was a girl on the telephone who was in the hospital. She said she had tickets for the show but couldn't come as she had a serious illness. And Elvis said, 'I want to talk to her', so he marched into a room and held up the entire show for fifteen minutes to talk to that girl, asking her several questions, with warmth and interest. Just before hanging up, I remember he said, 'No, honey I don't have a blue Cadillac. I've got a pink one, a black one, a white one - a pause, and then he said, oh yeah, I do have a blue one'. He was a gentleman and I respected that immensely. Lew Allen, a then 17 year old student who went on to earn an Associate\u2019s Degree in photography and a B.A. in Fine Arts/Photography from the Rochester Institute of Technology. He was asked to photograph Elvis at the Cleveland Arena in Ohio, on November 23, 1956 because of a labour strike affecting the three major newspapers, as told by Mr. Allen in an interview published in Rock paper on June 6, 2005.\n\n\n\nI didn't know very much about him, and those in the business knew very little about him. But, he was in the Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, so I saw this kid and it was hard to say what he had, but there was something unusual about him. He had an interesting quality and his sound wasn't that important. It was the way he conducted himself, the way he put a song over. Anyway, I made a note immediately to book him for our new show, and we just had the good fortune that between that night and when he appeared a few weeks later suddenly there was a lot of controversy and media attention. Steve Allen's answer as to how did the Elvis appearance in his ABC.TV show, which drew 40 million viewers following the NBC TV Milton Berle controversy came about, as told in an interview on June 30 of 1996.\n\n\n\nIt was like a country show back then and we got to open it and we did a couple of his songs, which was just stupid because we thought we'd impress him and he'd like us. The first time I saw him play - I'd seen him one time before that particular tour came to town where we opened the show for him- I just couldn't believe it. He was such a rocker. I'd never seen anything like that before. Buddy was terribly impressed as well. All of us the same. Turned into a big fan. Buddy tried to sound like him for months. And personally, he was as charismatic as he could be... Jerry Allison, drummer for Buddy Holly, as well as the Crickets, recalling the early days when they opened for Elvis at Buddy Holly's hometown of Lubbock, Texas, as published in Classicbands.com\n\n\n\nRock n\u2019 roll, through Elvis, became a target of southern segregationists, who believed that race mixing led, inevitably, to miscegenation and that exposure to black culture promoted juvenile delinquency and sexual immorality Glenn C. Altschuler, in his book \"All Shook Up: How Rock 'n Roll Changed America\" (Oxford University Press 2003)\n\n\n\nObama is like Elvis, there will always be demand for impersonators of such popular and historical people. Ilham Anas, Indonesia's most successful Obama impersonator, as reporter in This week in Asia, on November 5, 2016.\n\n\n\nAfter one of Elvis Presley's last shows, I was heading back to my car when a matron from Zachary stopped me and gushed about how wonderful he had been. Didn't you just LOVE him?\" she asked. \"Well, I thought he looked tired and sick and was just going through the motions.\" Whereupon she whacked me on the head with the rolled-up Elvis poster she was carrying. LOL. I took it in stride \u2014 nobody ever said it was easy being a music critic. \u2026 Music critic Smiley Anders, writing for The Advocate in an article published on their March 25, 2019 edition.\n\n\n\nElvis Presley has been such a determining force in music, before and after his death. On a personal level, I owe so much to Elvis as he is essentially the musician who pushed me to be the performer I am. I have always loved his music so I am returning to celebrate him along with some of my amazing musician friends. Daniel Anderson, vocalist in the Harvey World Travel East of London-organized benefit for the Cancer Association of South Africa (Cansa)'s, entitled The Wonder of You: The Story of Elvis, as reported by the Go&Express, on October 6, 2017\n\n\n\nI discovered the blues in a funny kind of a way, from the age of seven when I was listening to my father\u2019s war-time collection of big band jazz. It had that thing about it \u2013 I didn\u2019t really know what it was \u2013, that set the pulse racing a bit; and then I heard echoes of it again, with early Elvis Presley. Ian Anderson, singer, flautist and leader of Jethro Tull, explaining to G.Brown, of the Denver Music Examiner, his first experience with hearing the blues, starting at the age of 7, as published in that newspaper's online edition, on August 11, 2008.\n\n\n\nUnbelievable! To hear my father grouped together with Elvis Presley, William Faulkner and Eudora Welty, it's a dream. John Anderson, son of painter Waltyer Inglis Anderson, speaking of his father's induction into the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Experience Hall of Fame, as reported by ABC center on December 16, 2017, with the other 17 members being Jimmie Rodgers, Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Leontyne Price, Elvis Presley, James Earl Jones, Jim Henson, Morgan Freeman, Oprah Winfrey, Sela Ward, George Ohr, William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty, Tennessee Williams, and John Grisham\n\n\n\nHis latest album, \"Piano\", is a collection of his past work, stripped down so all you hear is his beloved piano. It was hearing an Elvis Presley song that sparked his passion for the piano when he was young. About ABBA-founder Benny Andersson's decision to take up piano, at age 11 in his native Sweden, specifically after hearing \"Treat me nice\", the B side of the \"Jailhouse Rock\" single, as noted by Tom Power of CBCRadio on December 10, 2017\n\n\n\nAfter doing \u2018Dr. No\u2019 with Sean Connery, the brass at Paramount proposed that I co-star with Elvis. At first I turned the offer down, mainly because after having dated James Dean, I had imagined Elvis to be an \"ordinary\" person. So they organized a meet-up and, to my amazement, I immediately fell for his charm. He was extremely well educated and when I told him I hated Rock and that I liked Gospel, he gave me his entire collection of gospel songs. Little did I know that was his main source of inspiration. Anyways, we became instant friends and he loved to cook for me when we were on location. He told me he would have loved to live in Europe and, when he saw the BMW 507 my then husband John Derek had, he gave me another, one of the two he had had, as a present. Twenty years later, in 1982, after selling John's to Fred Astaire, I auctioned the one Elvis gave me for US$300,000 and then the person who bought it from me later sold it for 1.2 million UK pounds. He was in fact, a one in a billion type, a wholly adorable person and we remained in touch till his death. Swiss actress Ursula Andress in an interview published in Mujer Hoy, on 12 January 2016.\n\n\n\nHis knowledge was even more extensive than mine. I prided myself on knowing all that stuff. And man, we'd be hanging out and Elvis would be talking about singers I didn't even know about!!!. Sherman Andrus, Gospel Music Hall of Famer and one of the first African Americans to be integrated into a Southern Gospel group, (Elvis' personal group The Imperials), attesting to Elvis' deep knowledge of African American Gospel music, from the Gospel side of Elvis.\n\n\n\nMy older brothers played Elvis all the time and there was a lot about his music that inspired us all. Not only an inspiration but he showed up to give his generation permission on a lot of fronts to carry a torch. When I finally met him in Houston, it was like a receiving line at a wedding, as surreal a moment as any in my life. I could not even actually shake his hand. I just bowed. Canadian singer Andy Kim, interviewed by phone from Toronto by Patrick Bales and published on the Orillia Packet & Time website on March 17, 2017\n\n\n\nBeto, he\u2019s a rock star right now, he\u2019s Elvis Presley, Maximo Anguiano, of the Texas Organizing Project, in reference to Beto O\u2019Rourke\u033a being the candidate who could unseat Sentaro Ted Cruz oin the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\n\n\nIn Vegas, we\u2019d meet and we\u2019d talk about everything. Slowly he started coming over to see my show; he\u2019d sit up there and I\u2019d come back after the show and we\u2019d talk music. He would show up, this incredible God-like figure. He had everything, and the voice \u2014what a great voice he had. Then, on August 17, 1977 I happened to be in Las Vegas, so when I turned on the news and learned of his death, I cried all day. He was a cool, nice man. Paul Anka, from his autobiography \"My way\"\n\n\n\nI want to celebrate his life. He was so gifted, I just cherish his memory, his generosity, and he was so private, like I am. He knew about honour, and respect, and was so considerate, and his manners, and the way he was so civilized. And as an entertainer he will never be repeated. I wanted him to know all that, and I did tell him, but very few others did... Actress and entertainer Ann Margret, in an interview with Charlie Rose, as broadcast on February 11, 1994.\n\n\n\nI think there was that part of the so-called punk idea that everything in the past was rubbish and all that mattered was punk. I was never really interested in the spitting and the safety pins or that nonsense. I liked the Sex Pistols, and that was about it. Adam and the Ants were very much outside of that anyway. So my liking of Elvis and rock and roll music that I\u2019d grown up with was always in there; it was always something that was a big influence. Elvis\u2019s death was tragic, I remember when he died, it was a very sad day in general, so it\u2019s obviously a great loss to everybody. I never thought, Oh, he was something that didn\u2019t matter, because he did. I have visited Graceland and you could see the man was overwhelmingly honest. He never professed any taste other than his own, that is, country boy made good. He never pretended to be anyone else. Adam Ant, leader of Adam and the Ants, a punk rock band, in an article published on September 5 2017, at the Tampa Bay Times\n\n\n\nOne day while he and Richard Davis were conversing he removed the watch from his wrist, handing it to Davis and stating there was something wrong with the back of it. When Davis turned the timepiece over to inspect it, he saw to his great surprise that the case back had been inscribed, \"To Richard, From E.P. Elvis then said, \"I guess it's yours now\". He was known for being extremely generous, often giving away his valuable personal belongings as presents so it was not surprising that he gifted his prized 18kt yellow gold Corum Buckingham to Davis. Antiquorum Auctioneers's notes for those attending the November 11 2018 auction held in Geneva, Switezerland, and highlighting the sale of a yellow 18k gold Corum 1960 Buckingham wristwatch gifted by Elvis to Richard Davis, his long time friend and last wardrobe manager, as detailed in Antiquorumwebpage.\n\n\n\nIt was the early 1970s. I was 22, working in some little show in a hotel that\u2019s now gone, and he was doing a gig at the Las Vegas Hilton. We met backstage at a Tom Jones concert, then he showed me some karate moves, with a small party of folks ending up at his penthouse suite. There, he turned to me and said he had something to show me in his bedroom, so I thought, 'Oh, here comes the cliche,\u2019 Turns out, he just wanted to read to me from Kahlil Gibran\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet.\u201d It was a sweet moment, as he sat on a footstool beside me and read like a child, his finger following the text. He signed the book, gave it to me and told me to have a blessed life. He was so sweet, that\u2019s what struck me the most. In retrospect, I view him as a prisoner of his fame. That, and his roots in gospel music and the church, fueled his desire to seek out more knowledge about the world and self-realization. Actress Susan Anton, as told to Michael Grossberg at Dispatchcom.\n\n\n\nThe biggest surprise about his singing had been revealed when he gave us a private concert and sang \"Love me tender\" a soft, ultra-slow ballad at the quaint music bungalow on the far west side of 20th Century lot. It was away from the bustle of traffic and from the big stages and it looked like the kind of cottage Walt Disney would have built for Snow White and Prince Charming. This was where Elvis felt relaxed, comfortable. So Ken Darby sat at the grand piano at the far end of the living room and Elvis stood a few feet behind him and in front of a tall stained-glass window. He stood erect, as if he was in a choir. Ken started to play the soft melody and I hardly knew that Elvis had started to sing, as his voice, barely louder than the piano, was pitched slightly higher than his usual. It had a lot of resonance and vibration and Elvis was on-key for every note, no matter how long, short, high or low. When he finished, it seemed only normal to express our amazement. \"People think all I can do is belt,I used to sing nothing but ballads before I went professional. I love to sing slow,but seldom get to do it\", he said, the continued to explain that as a boy, an only child, he would sing like that when he sang with his mother and dad in church. \"It was a small church, only seated about 75, you couldn't sing too loud there. Army Archerd, a columnist for Variety then interviewing Elvis for the Photoplay Magazine and who was present at the sessions, including an intimate concert for a dozen or so, which preceeded the actual recording of the \"Love me tender\" soundtrack, as noted in an document entitled \"Photoplay (Jul-Dec 1956)\" as digitized by the Internet Archive in 2017 with funding from Media History Digital Library\n\n\n\nIn the high-stakes game of Los Angeles real estate, a good celebrity pedigree is always a bonus. Of course, not all celebrities are created equal. A home that was once owned by Cary Grant or Elizabeth Taylor, for instance, would probably hold broader appeal than one formerly inhabited by, say, Zsa Zsa Gabor. On that score, David Alhadef definitely struck gold when he discovered the new location for Casa Perfect, the L.A. outpost of his furniture mecca, the Future Perfect: designed in 1958 by architect Rex Lotery and renovated in the mid-1960s, the house is an idiosyncratic mash-up of classic California modernism and Hollywood Regency. For six years, it belonged to Elvis Presley.

When my cousin, four years older than me, played me two and a half minutes of music, which changed my life. That music was Elvis Presley, singing Hound Dog, and for the next six months \u2013 to my mother's absolute horror \u2013 I didn't want to hear anything but the rawest rock'n'roll I could lay my hands on. Do you know? For those who didn\u2019t live through the Fifties, it\u2019s really hard to imagine the enormous cultural gulf which existed between England and America at that time. Elvis himself was a God and in some of the first footage that we saw in England, seemed to us like an alien super being from a distant universe. I was 11 years old and I couldn\u2019t in any way imagine being part of the same world. These early years were something of a dream. By 1964, we got a recording contract with Decca and then unbelievably by Christmas, found ourselves topping the U.S charts with our first record, \u201cShe\u2019s Not There.\u201d This magic land, which only eight years before had seemed so unimaginably remote and unconquerable and even more unbelievably, something we didn\u2019t find out until many years later, Elvis actually had our records on his jukebox. I could not believe that! Rod Argent English musician, speaking about his reaction when told his band the Zombies would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as noted by RollingStone's 30 March,2019 edition.\n\n\n\nI had been called up for national service and was stationed in Germany at the same time as Elvis when I came across an article on him in a magazine. The article even had his address in Germany, so with a girl friend we set off one morning to find him. We went there and rang the bell, it was a Sunday morning. The maid answered it and told us he\u2019d be down in a few minutes. There was nobody else there, except my friend and I. He took us inside the hallway, and we had a nice chat. He posed for photographs and signed autographs. We were very lucky that morning.

It's like my record collection is actually sitting in this room. I'm truly fortunate. You know, I've always loved rock & roll music. I always have. Soon as I opened my eyes and took my first breath, I was a fan. With my brother David, we listened to Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Cheap Trick and Pyromania by Def Leppard. My oldest brother Alan, he had the Beatles and the Stones and the Kinks. My sister Hollie was like \"Kool and the Gang.\" My sister Anna for that record collection that turned my world inside out. And my sister, Marci, who's pretty much the person who showed me Elvis Presley for the first time. Thank you so much.

You would be surprised what we could do together. You ask me if I think he is good. How many Cadillacs was it he bought.? That boy's no fool... Louis Armstrong, interviewed by Memphis Press Scimitar, March 1, 1957 edition.\n\n\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush was equally at ease in all settings, something that seemed so characteristic of the man I revered. But my work with him didn\u2019t end when he left politics. While working in government relations for Shell, I sometimes hosted foreign Ambassadors visiting Houston. On one occasion the Ambassador of Ukraine, Yuriy Shcherbak, was in town to meet with officials at NASA, give speeches and join up with the Ukrainian community there. On the last morning the Ambassador, who was a fan of Elvis Presley, did a live television interview on what by sheer coincidence happened to be Elvis' birthday, and the station had an Elvis impersonator on the set, to do a routine. When \u201cElvis\u201d and the Ambassador crossed in the green room, the two exchanged bear hugs, and we took pictures. We later arrived at Bush\u2019s office, and he cordially received Ambassador Schckerbak and asked how the visit had gone. He politely talked about the various events, then with a twinkle in his eye said: \u201cAnd this morning Bill introduced me to Elvis!\u201d. Bush gave me a quizzical look as if to ask, \u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d The Ambassador then recounted the whole tale, followed by robust laughter all around... Bill Arnold, former advance man for the then ( in 1980, therefore three years after Elvis\u032a death), Vice Presidential candidate George H.W. Bush and, since 2000 Professor at the Jesse H.

Now, I wasn\u2019t watching the blonde and I didn\u2019t know who he was, so I took him down to the Las Vegas police station where I then worked and I gave him a pass...

Art's Strange World review of the CD \"The Sun Sessions\" (15 August 2007)\n\n\n\nElena Quarestani, an Italian collector with a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting, was entangled in these onerous rules, namely the Milanese officials wanting to protect his \"Figure at a Table\" (1925) as an example of Italian cultural heritage even though it is an early work of his that does not incorporate any of the motifs for which he is known. He would likely be amused by the surreality of the government\u2019s arbitrary ruling. Similarly, Andy Warhol would have loved that two of his early paintings hung in a casino in the German town of Aachen, a spa city near the border with Belgium and the Netherlands. On their way to slot machines and poker tables, gamblers passed \"Triple Elvis\", a 1963 silkscreen painting of three life-size images of Elvis Presley on a silver background and \"Four Marlons\", a 1966 silkscreen painting of four life-sized images of Marlon Brando on a motorcycle. Purchased in the late 1970s for $185,000 (approximately $700,000 today), the paintings were part of a plan to glamorize an otherwise off-the-beaten-track gambling parlor. When the casino conglomerate that owned the Aachen operation fell on hard times, a German state-owned bank seized control of the company and decided to sell the paintings. The sale was a reasonable action by the owners to raise cash for a troubled company. But protesters emerged, claiming this was a dangerous sale of cultural property owned by a state-run financial institution. The sale went ahead anyway, and the works sold for $151.1 million.

But, if by chance we would be in the same club, he would sent me a bottle of champagne every time. He was a divine human being.

I really liked him.

The government, which has strict laws to keep the races separate, banned the picture because Presley plays the son of an American Indian woman and a white man An Associated Press report from Johannesburg, dated May 31, 1961, the day when the film was set to open at theatres throughout the then Apartheid-ruled Republic of South Africa. A day later, 20th Century-Fox appealed and as a result the Board of Censors lifted the ban, on condition that the film not be shown to the country's indiginous population, with the film then opening to segregated theatres, starting in Durban in early June. However, it was permanently banned on cinemas in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, as colonial government officials in those territories were afraid the movie could reignite racial tensions in the aftermath of the bloody Mau Mau rebellion.\n\n\n\nIn times of trouble, I put my faith in Elvis Presley, who represented the South\u2019s better angels. He was a hard worker, and although he lived the high life, he never forgot that he had been born into poverty. And he was a self-made talent, perhaps the greatest entertainer of all time, born in a two-room shack in Tupelo, Miss., in 1935. I\u2019ve been to that small shotgun house many times, reflecting on what it says about America. Greatness can be born anywhere.His father Vernon was a laborer who was often out of work, and the Presleys relied on the kindness of family and neighbors to get them through the hard times.When Elvis was young, the Presleys lost it, and they ended up shuttling around Tupelo, often living in black neighborhoods, where Elvis famously developed an ear for black gospel and blues to supplement his love of the old-time gospel he knew from his own church.I still believe in my heart that most Southerners are still more like Elvis than President Trump. We are most likely to pull over and help someone stranded on the roadside. Most of the people I know in my Mississippi town would give you the shirt off their backs. Most Southern preachers don\u2019t spend Sundays in the pulpit spewing hatred and intolerance. Most people agree that racism and white supremacy are evil. Even preschoolers know it\u2019s always better to tell the truth and take your lumps than lie and evade. And yet here we are. We know right from wrong, but most of us down here voted for wrong. As Elvis once said, \u201cTruth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain\u2019t goin\u2019 away. Ace Atkins, in his article, \"In Elvis we trust\", part of TIME magazione\u2019s August 6 special issue on the American South.\n\n\n\nElvis changed the country music scene quite a bit; he almost put country music out of business. He was white, but he sang black. It wasn't socially acceptable for white kids to buy black records at the time. Did I have any sense of how big he was going to be when he first came to RCA? Oh yeah, we knew. Back in those days, if a guy got hot in one area you could spread it around the country, maybe the world. He was already so big in East Texas and Louisiana you couldn\u2019t get him off stage with a firehose. We knew. When he came in to do \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d I called up my wife and told her to come over. I said, You might not get a chance to see him again, he\u2019s gonna get so damn big. Lots of people have asked me if Elvis could play guitar. Well, he played pretty good. And he played piano and drums. The first sessions he\u2019d come in and work. After that, when he got more confident, he\u2019d come in and play drums a while, then guitar, then piano only to then go to work starting around 11 o\u2019clock at night. But he loved gospel music. The first time I ever heard him I thought, \u201cWhat in the hell is this?\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell if he was black or bluegrass or gospel or what. Of course that was what made him what he was. He was so damn versatile he could sing anything. Chet Atkins, Pop Chronicles, Show 8 - The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the rock-a-billies.

Beyond the staggering realization of what we had found, there was a musical element that also knocked our socks off: On these tapes Glen is singing pure rock and roll and with a sense of joy, passion and wild abandon that can only have come from knowing that his idol, the avatar Elvis Presley, would be an audience of one for these recordings.\u201d Stephen Auerbach, detailing for RollingStone what he felt after finding and playing tapes which had been lost of Glen Campbell doing demos for Elvis, as published on October 31, 2018.\n\n\n\nWhen Elvis came back from the service and he was greeted by all the publicity, the press, the photographers, reporters, and so forth, someone said to him \"Well, what do you think now that you're not number one but Avalon is ?\" And he said \" Oh, I love his song \"Venus\" and there's room for everybody.\" And I thought that was really genuine, nice compliment.

Everything about the place seemed awesome to me, from the giant Corinthian columns out front, to the purple and yellow room with three televisions built into the wall, to the big man\u2019s grave out back. But what has stuck with me the most from the visit is a particular story about Elvis. Elvis had grown up poor, and I\u2019m sure when he was poor money was important. But when he started to make more money than he could ever spend, or maybe just enough money to have every material thing he wanted, it no longer held importance to him. So, during a party at Graceland he was inside with a guest who came from a poor background, and the other partygoers were outside on the lawn. His friend commented on how sophisticated all of the partygoers seemed. Elvis walked over to his desk, pulled a stack of money from one of the drawers, opened a window, and threw the bills out the window. The partygoers scrambled after the bills, shoving each other, trying to grab as much money as they could. Elvis turned to his friend and said, \u201cThey\u2019re not that sophisticated.\u201d Brett Baker, for Chicagon now, published on December 22, 2016.\n\n\n\ni) We can even hazard a little analysis as to what made his voice so appealing. \"That curious baritone,\" one critic called it. Actually, that is inexact. The voice had mixed propensities, hovering between tenor and bass and everything in between. Even a convincing falsetto lay within his range. One thing he was not, ever, was \"Steve-'n-Edie\", the polished, professionally accomplished Vegas artistes who once pronounced on an afternoon interview show (Mr. Lawrence enunciating the sentiment for himself and his partner/wife, Ms. Gorme), \"We don't really think of Elvis as a singer. But he was a star.\" It is only when, years later, one gets past the indignation of hearing such apparent ignorance, that the sense of the observation becomes clear. A singer is someone like Steve Lawrence rolling effortlessly (and meaninglessly) through a shlock-standard like \"What Now, My Love?\". More or less like doing the scales. A star is the persona in whom one invests one's vicarious longings, a being who is constantly hazarding \u2014 and intermittently succeeding at \u2014 the impossible stretches that every soul wishes to attempt but lacks the means or the will to. It's not a matter of virtuosity. ii) Take My Baby LeftMe (1956) by Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, the black Mississippi sharecropper whose That's All Right had literally been Elvis' first recording, in 1954.

When he danced, the people danced, the girls would actually faint because of what he was doing. The people didn\u2019t care if he was white or black, he was a good artist and they felt his music. Lavern Baker, commenting on her covering one of Presley's best early 60's songs, with a few changes in the lyrics, which she recorded in late 1961 as a answer to Presley's \"Little Sister\".\n\n\n\nPresley's voice was remarkable in the sense that, through it, he touched people in a way only great artists can do. (In fact), the people he touched are as diverse as humanity itself and, because of that his popularity has transcended race, class, national boundaries, and culture. There is no simple answer about why that is so, all I can say is he had that magic. When Elvis Presley was first popular, many people said that he did not have a good voice. Almost everyone, today, knows that he did, but more people today should see him not simply as a performer, but as an artist with a great soul. John Bakke, professor emeritus of the University of Memphis, in an interview with the US State Department, transcripted by UNUSINFO on July 18, 2006 on the legacy of Elvis Presley\n\n\n\nI don't think any two men on this planet ever had the charisma of Elvis Presley and Jackie Wilson. The two of them remind me of each other: the charisma. Hank Ballard, rhythm and blues singer and songwriter, lead vocalist of the Midnighters, as noted in the book \"Jackie Wilson: Lonely Teardrops\" by Tony Douglas.\n\n\n\nWith him, it\u2019s the pictures that spoke loudest about the man behind the genius. Take Sunday Times photographer Chris Smith\u2019s classic shot in which a scowling Seve, handsome head turned from the driving rain, jacket held across his chest like a matador\u2019s cape, and he is curling his lip. It tells you everything you need to know about his mood, his game, and his grim determination to outfox the elements and annihilate his opponent. It\u2019s pure Elvis. About Seve Ballesteros, Spain's all time greatest golfer, as reported in the Sunday Times on May 8, 2011.\n\n\n\nThen, in 1954, Elvis happened. The influence that the softly spoken Mississippi native had on popular music - and in particular rockabilly - is incalculable. First billed as 'The Hillbilly Cat' (again a nod towards black and white influences), the boy with the seemingly rubber limbs sang both blues and country songs infused with elements of this new rockabilly movement to the bemusement of a music industry not yet aware of the significance of what they were listening to. They didn't know it at the time, but the music establishment had just changed forever.Two years later he signed with RCA and the ensuing exposure he received on national television introduced rockabilly to its widest audience yet and, like fire to kindling, there was no stopping its spread. Other labels swooped to sign up any artists who sang even vaguely similar to Elvis and there was a bona fide musical gold rush underway and record executives and studio bigwigs fell over themselves to capitalise on this musical trend which was now sweeping the nation - ultimately playing a big part in rockabilly's eventual downfall, as more and more people tried to make money from it, (thus) watering down its raunchiness as they tried to make it appear to as large a market as possible, and (finally) taming its sound beyond recognition. Excerpted from an article entitled \"The Roots of Rockabilly: Examining the origins of a rock n' roll movement\", by John Balfe, and as published in www.entertainment.ie\n\n\n\nI might be the biggest Elvis fan you\u2019ve ever met. I mean, I\u2019ve seen it all. And I just loved him. I don\u2019t know what it was. I mean, probably the same reason everybody loved Elvis. Cause he was electric. He was just electric, the greatest entertainer I\u2019ve ever seen, and I think the reason why was because \u2014 and I heard him say it many times in interviews \u2014 , he always did what he felt. Genuinely did what he felt. It wasn\u2019t choreographed. It wasn\u2019t, OK, well, I\u2019m gonna do this move at this time. It was coming up from inside of him, and it was coming out. That\u2019s what it was, and that\u2019s why people connected with it. Cause it was the real deal.\u201d Country music songwriter and singer Frankie Ballard who, along with a few others, voted Elvis as the top entertainer in CMT Top 40 artist countdown, as published in CMT\u00b4s online edition of November 21, 2014.\n\n\n\nIt was the autumn of 1971, and two tickets to an Elvis show turned up at the offices of Creem magazine, where I was then employed. It was decided that those staff members who had never had the privilege of witnessing Elvis should get the tickets, which was how me and art director Charlie Auringer ended up in nearly the front row of the biggest arena in Detroit. Earlier Charlie had said, \u201cDo you realize how much we could get if we sold these things?\u201d I didn\u2019t, but how precious they were became totally clear the instant Elvis sauntered onto the stage. He was the only male performer I have ever seen to whom I responded sexually; it wasn\u2019t real arousal, rather an erection of the heart, when I looked at him I went mad with desire and envy and worship and self-projection. I mean, Mick Jagger, whom I saw as far back as 1964 and twice in \u201865, never even came close. Rock critic Lester Bangs' opening sentence in Elvis' obituary, by special request from and published by the Village Voice on 20 August 1977.\n\n\n\nI mean, don't tell me about Lenny Bruce, man - Lenny Bruce said dirty words in public and obtained a kind of consensual martyrdom. Plus which Lenny Bruce was hip, too goddam hip if you ask me, which was his undoing, whereas Elvis was not hip at all. Elvis was a goddam truck driver who worshipped his mother and would never say \"shit\" or \"fuck\" around her, and Elvis alerted America to the fact that it had a groin with imperatives that had been stifled. Lenny Bruce demonstrated how far you could push a society as repressed as ours and how much you could get away with, but Elvis kicked \"How Much Is That Doggie in the Window\" out the window and replaced it with \"Let's fuck.\" The rest of us are still reeling from the impact. Sexual chaos reigns currently, but out of chaos may flow true understanding and harmony, and either way Elvis almost single handedly opened the floodgates.

Republished in Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung pg. 215-216\n\nthe window and replaced it with \"Let's fuck.\" The rest of us are still reeling from the impact. Sexual chaos reigns currently, but out of chaos may flow true understanding and harmony, and either way Elvis almost single handedly opened the floodgates.\n\nElvis' lowest effective note was a low-G, as heard on \"He'll Have To Go\"(1976); on \"King Creole\" (1958), he growls some low-F's; going up, his highest full-voiced notes were the high-B's in \"Surrender\"(1961) and \"Merry Christmas Baby\" (1971), the high-G at the end of \"My Way\" (1976 live version), and the high-A of \"An American Trilogy\"(1972); using falsetto, Elvis could reach at least a high-E, e.g, as in \"Unchained Melody\" (1977), so, it was very nearly a three-octave range, although more practically two-and-a-half. George Barbel, as a follow up to a question on what was Elvis' range, as published in All Experts.com, on 20th May, 2007.\n\n\n\nBy the time we got towards the end of our stay there, Elvis was worn out, so he got all the singers individually to do a song. Of course, all the musicians knew that I play and sang and they knew some of my songs. Elvis was obviously hesitating and thinking of something else to do, and Ronnie said: 'Let Bardwell sing'. He just went, 'Yeah, right ...'. And Guercio said, 'No, really. You wanna do something else, let him sing, because he can sing'. So Elvis went, 'Ladies and gentlemen, my bassplayer is going to sing now'. So Charlie Hodge gave me his guitar and I got Charlie's mike. Charlie was holding another mike on the guitar, for me to play it. And I didn't know what to do. I mean, how am I going to follow Kathy Westmoreland doing 'My Heavenly Father'? And Donnie Sumner said, 'Do the Hurricane song'. You know, 'Please Don't Bury Me' by John Prine. I got to the last verse of the song that's a bit off color. We were going from 'My Heavenly Father' to 'Kiss My Ass Goodbye', and it just took everybody by surprise. That was a really good moment, because I had shown Elvis a part of me that he didn't know of. He knew that what we had just done was showbusiness, and it was good showbusiness, because it was entertaining. I went back to the dressing room after the show, and Tom Diskin knocked on the door. We let him in, and he said 'I have a message for you from the Colonel' So I figured that I was fired when he sent Tom Diskin into the dressing room, but he said, He wants me to tell you that that's one of the funniest things he's ever seen at an Elvis Presley show'. I was thrilled with that. If I didn't do anything else I had done that. That was fun TCB Bass player Duke Bardwell's story of how how he got to sing John Prine\u2019s \u2018Please Don\u2019t Bury Me\u2019 during the October 14th, 1974 closing show in Lake Tahoe, NV, in an interview with Arjan as published on the FECC Forum'spage.\n\n\n\nBaritones UnBound continues the second season of Asolo Rep's five-year American Character Project, an in-depth look at this nation and its people. No other voice has defined the United States quite like the booming sound of the baritone. From Sinatra to Elvis and much more, this musical journey chronicles some of the most beloved singers and songs of all time. Conceived by Broadway leading man and threetime Tony Award nominee Marc Kudisch and created by Merwin Foard, three dynamite baritones take the stage to give us a captivating musical tour of the baritone voice throughout history, namely Marc Kudisch, Jeff Mattsey, and Timothy Splain.

Frankly, we didn't rate them musically, but we were impressed when they told us about they having met with Elvis Presley, \"Elvo\" to us. And when they told Ian Anderson he sang like 'Elvo' he was very flattered and to this day the rest of the band and I always call Ian 'Elvo'!\u201d Barriemore Barlow, drummer for Jethro Tull in an interview with Nick Dent-Robinson, recalling their attending Elvis' August 11, 1969 show at the International Hotel in Las Vegas on the special invitation of UK record producer Terry Ellis and as published on 03/04/2014 at the Jethro Tull Forum.\n\n\n\nA few days before Christmas one year, Elvis was in the store buying guns for some of his friends as gifts. There was a customer off to the side looking at a display case that held nothing but expensive Browning over-under shotguns. Presley went up to the gentleman and commented on how nice the guns were. The man agreed, but said they were way out of his price range, since they were all probably in the thousand dollar plus area. Elvis asked the guy which one he would buy if he was purchasing, and the fellow said probably the Diana grade with the gold inlay. Elvis then went back to the counter where Jerry Knight was, and as he left said to Jerry, \"When that guy gets ready to leave, take that Diana grade shotgun out and put it on the counter and give it to him. Tell him Elvis said Merry Christmas.\" Jerry said he did just that, and he thought the guy was going to faint when he received the gift. Ken Barnes, who worked at Kerr's Beverly Hill's Sports Shop, as published by the Californian on December 13, 2017.\n\n\n\nNot only did Elvis give teens their own music with which to identify, he proved that much of the disposable income of this generation would be spent on music, fashion, and media of its own choosing and thus turning that generation into a high-pro!le, identifable group with their own fashion sense, hair styles, slang, taste in music, preferences in movie stars and other favorite pastimes.

Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2004.\n\n\n\nWhile Elvis Presley and Roy Orbison were ruling the rock-pop charts in the US, he had everyone grooving to his music in Nepal. The song \"Deula yo joban timilai deula\" may have sounded similar to what was trending internationally, but was given a funky twist of his own, and arguably was responsible for introducing rock and pop to the entire nation. He became a heartthrob in his country and was soon called the Elvis Presley of Nepal because he came like a breath of fresh air in a music scene dominated by traditional tunes. About Kumar Basnet, as noted in the Kathmandu post's March 15 edition.\n\n\n\nHe started drawing on my front all the way down to my navel, doodling as I spoke to him, in front of hundreds at his dressing room after his August 1970 opening show at the International Hotel in Las Vegas. Incredible sensation, he used a biro!!! That night back at my hotel, alone, I undressed and there they were, the doodlings. I did not wash until they wore off...

But it is the line about the need for \"a little less conversation, a little more action\" that best sums up his situation at Arsenal... Adam Bate, one of Sky Sports top anchors, assessing Wilshire\u2019s performance for his network, in an article published on December 11, 2017 ( Since Elvis' \"The Wonder of you\" is the song played at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium before players enter the field this could explain West Ham fans' decision to play \"A little less conversation\" when they, in turn, feel their own team needs to improve its play).\n\n\n\nHe had a musically textured rhythmic voice that had emotional intelligence; concentrate on his voice: sweet, remorseful, defiant, suggestive.

Diego Maradona is Elvis Presley singing 'My Way' at his last concert at the Market Square Arena in Indianapolis. He embodies the deity, the absolute power, the sunset, the snowy peaks and the abyss. And Lionel Messi is Paul McCartney, the long-play list, the continuity and the health. To ask one of them to have what the other has doesn't look to be a proof of social intelligence but one of galloping dissatisfaction of a country that doesn't conform with having two of the three best footballers in history in less than 40 years. Argentinean novelist Juan Jos\u00e9 Becerra, in an article published in July of 2016 at El Clarin, his country's most prestigious newspaper.\n\n\n\nI met Elvis in 1968 at the Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas and had a drink with him. A lady asked him for an autograph but he didn\u2019t have a pen, so I gave him mine. Then he gave me the pen back and that's when I said, \u201cNaw, you keep it Elvis. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to be asking for my autograph. William O. Beck, in an interview with Jeff Sterling for the Titusville Herald, and published on August 13, 2018.\n\n\n\nElvis is right up there with death and taxes in things that can't be avoided, Writer Joel Beers, reviewing the 1968 NBC TV Elvis Special for OC Weekly, on January 4, 2018.\n\n\n\nLike some sort of Grammy-powered \"Super Friends\" , John Legend, Post Malone, Jennifer Lopez, Blake Shelton and more than a dozen more artists joined forces on February 17,2019, for a prime time television special titled \u201cElvis All-Star Tribute\". The union of Post Malone and Urban demonstrated that \u2014 for Elvis Presley Enterprises, at least \u2014 the show's mission, in large part, was to affirm the idea of Elvis' universal appeal. Adam Lambert wore a blue suit and blue suede shoes during his version of \"Blue Suede Shoes\", while Jennifer Lopez went full J.Lo during \"Heartbreak Hotel\"- Another highlight was Mac Davis' solo rendition of \"Memories,\" a song he wrote for the original 1968 special. Davis, 77, the elder statesman amongst the performers (beating John Fogerty by four years), shared a poignant memory of holding the then infant Lisa Marie Presley during a visit to Elvis' Bel Air home. He later was joined by John Legend, who sang a Davis composition that has emerged as one of Elvis' biggest posthumous hits, \"A Little Less Conversation.\" Others on the show included Darius Rucker, Ed Sheeran, Kelsea Ballerini, Alessia Cara, Josh Groban, Pistol Annies and Little Big Town. Lisa Marie did not perform, but introduced a gospel medley segment featuring Carrie Underwood and Yolanda Adams; similarly, actress Riley Keough, Lisa Marie's only daughter, introduced Dierks Bentley, who contributed with the rocker, \"Little Sister\". \u201cI\u2019m here tonight because 50 years ago a King returned,\u201d said Shelton, host of the program and \u2014 not coincidentally \u2014 a judge on the hit NBC vocal competition program, \u201cThe Voice.\u201d, then adding that the original special had been often imitated but never surpassed while, in addition changing,as it also did, the game forever in music and television.

( A year passed, and while in Las Vegas) Elvis came backstage to say hello and he couldn't have been more decorous, insisting in calling me Mr. Belafonte. Only later would I learn that he had hung out for years with a lot of black musicians and had come by his style legitimately. (Alas), he performed with such put on flash that over the next years, I noticed, he inspired a whole generation of R&B players who thought they could put that flash on, and become Elvis, too.. Harry Belafonte in his autobiography, My song, published in 2011.\n\n\n\nI have been following the sound of my own voice since childhood, growing up in a family of academics in Knoxville. I spent my formative years playing air guitar while listening to the monolithic stereo console in my parents. My first concert experience was seeing an Elvis Presley in Knoxville. I was just about four years old but have some vivid memories of holding my parents\u2019 hands and people screaming, so it was kind of scary. I also remember him doing \u2018Hound Dog\u2019 and \u2018Teddy Bear.\u2019 And \u2018Teddy Bear\u2019 was such a favorite at the age of four that I brought out a big styrofoam guitar for it.

Pope Benedict XVI's question to the then quite sick Irish comedian Frank Carson, who, in 1987, had been ordained with a Papal knighthood of the \"Order of St. Gregory\" by the now Saint Pope John Paul II. The then sitting Pope's interest, expressed some 30 years after Presley's death, may lie in the fact that he was stationed, as a young professor within the German priesthood at a town not too far from Presley's barracks during his 18 month stay in Germany with the US Army. Carson's zany reply to the Pope? \"Not yet, your Holiness, but I soon will\", (Published in the Belfast Telegraph on August 10, 2017).\n\n\n\nI think she's going to become as big as Elvis Presley. He was, incidentally, the handsomest guy I ever met in my life, and a very nice person too. Tony Bennett, referring to singer, songwriter, and actress Lady Gaga in an article on Billboard published on August 17, 2011 and during an interview with the Guardian, on 17 October, 2013.\n\n\n\nI remember the first time in '56, I saw Elvis. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m buying that record because it\u2019s just the look that gets you, it\u2019s almost as much as the music. I kind of always had this theory that you look and listen with your eyes and your ears at the same time. He was the first rock 'n roll artist I loved. In my life, I started with him, but as I got into music, Elvis and the Rolling Stones led me to blues. Bill Bentley,American music industry executive in an interview with Salon, published on May 25, 2018.\n\n\n\nI listen to a lot of Elvis on the school bus. My bus driver, Ken Lyons, is \u2014 was, he's not with us anymore \u2014 but he's the biggest Elvis fan. So Channel 13 on SiriusXM radio, many, many nights listening to Elvis Presley and him educating me on Elvis. He's great, he's one of a kind. You can label him however you want to, but his country career was unbelievable. He had a voice that even if you didn't see all the moves and how good looking he was and all that stuff, you just listen to his voice when he's on the Louisiana Hayride with Faron Young and it's like, 'Wow, his voice is really unbelievable.' Great singer. And lot to learn. Dierks Bentley,in an interview with popculturecountry and publlished on their February 15,2019 edition.\n\n\n\nThe reason I chose Elvis Presley' songs as the teaser for this article is to trigger some autobiographical memories for adults who were adolescents when his music topped the charts, which he dominated throughout the 1950s.

When another culture\u2019s property is exploited for profit, that\u2019s appropriation, and it\u2019s always deserving of criticism. Elvis was just being Elvis. In \"Elvis Presley:The Searcher\" an HBO documentary, its signal achievement is in showing how the singer\u2019s early years, family culture, and socioeconomic background made inevitable the musician he was to become. It makes clear that he was, first, and foremost, a committed artist, utterly dedicated to music and its ability to move people.

He was the greatest there ever was, is, or ever will be. We did not have the airwaves he had, but he delivered what he obtained brilliantly. Let me conclude by saying that I realized during those early years that Elvis and I were creating a new sound.

I\u2019m disappointed by the bland and perfect vocal accomplishment, which I hear on so many recordings. Which is not to say that classical singers shouldn\u2019t try to become vocally masterful. I take my cue more and more from good pop singers. The other day I was looking at an early concert of Elvis Presley. It was fascinating to watch, the body language, the vocal suppleness Conor Biggs, Irish bass/baritone and classical singer, a founding member of Psallentes, a Gregorian chant ensemble, explaining to Michael Dervan, of the Irishman, for tips he looks for in a recital, as a way to better communicate with a listener, as published on that paper on February 1, 2013\n\n\n\nIn late 1959, Ibn Saud, the then King of Saudi Arabia. was spending time in Germany for medical reasons. One of his sons was a huge Elvis admirer, giving him a precious garment with golden applications, a waterpipe and a tea set with the royal crest on it, as a thank you gesture for his having left the Grunwald Hotel so that his father and his entire entourage could make total use of it. Soon after posing with the garment for the King's son at his newly rented house on #14 Goethestrasse, his friend and fellow GI Charlie Hodge had a zany idea: why couldn't he go out and walk in front of the German people, or anyone, for that matter, using the garment so as not to be recognized. This was finally done on February 1960, as he took a cab to the \"Mainzer Karneval\", a big public party, staying there for 3 days in the nearby town of Mainz which was not far from Bad Nauheim. And nobody noticed the by then Sgt Elvis Presley, in spite of him being accompanied by Hodge, plus two bodyguards all dressed as sailors as well as by a mysterious girl from Bad Nauheim, who did the translations. Elvis joined the whole programme, the clubs, the pubs, the bars, parades but stayed sober. The others did not, LOL. but they all returned safe, late at night. As published by BILD, Germany's highest selling tabloid, in an article published in March of 1960.\n\n\n\nSo I said \"Why don't we turn out all the lights so we don't see this vast empty looking studio the size of a football field and make it as intimate as we can?\" We could barely make Elvis out through the glass from the control room into the studio when we cued him the backing-track. And then, Elvis started to sing. It was magic,. Next thing I know he's curled on the floor in almost a fetal position singing with a microphone next to his mouth. The hair on my arms were standing up. And that's the take that we wound up using on the soundtrack album. I did not use it in the TV show because I'm a total believer that if you're doing television I don't want anyone lip-synching. I want the real thing. And to be completely honest, as great as the sit-down shows are, had I been able to get cameras and tape him there, it would have been even greater. I never put anybody I worked with on a pedestal, yet the first time I saw him, I was awed, first of all, by the way he looked. If he was not famous, you would still stop and stare. As a director, you\u2019re looking to see which is the good side, the bad side. Elvis was perfect from every angle. It was like a god walking in towards me... Steve Binder, director of the 1968 NBC/TV Special explaining how Elvis recorded \"If I can dream\", on June 23, 1968, exclusive for The King's court, on February 6, 2010, as well as in an interview with Vanity Fair published on August 17, 2018.\n\n\n\nHis privileged access let him show Muhammad Ali away from the ring: preaching or sleeping, posing with black leaders like Malcolm X and James Meredith or playing with his children or with Elvis Presley.

Her renditions of \"Yesterday\",\"For No One\" , \"Across The Universe\" and others became big favourites with radio DJs, not to mention with The Beatles, who always liked the way she interpreted their material. Previous praise from Randy Newman, for her take on one of his songs had been sweet music to her ears. And just imagine how she felt when Paul McCartney said to her that her \"Long And Winding Road\" was the song's definitive version. She had, however and this to her dying day, something to be immensely proud of \u2013 Elvis Presley had her \"You're my world\" on his famous jukebox at Graceland. About UK singer Cilla Black, in an article published at the Sunday Post\u032a's December 28, 2018 edition but which nevertheless fails to highlight that it was her \"You're my world\" which was actually being played at Elvis' jukebox when the Beatles visited him at his 525 Perugia Way home in Bel Air, California on August 27, 1965.\n\n\n\nI was in a friend's studio when a buddy of his called and told him. 'I got some news for you. Do you want me to tell you now or later?' I said later because I was in the studio when President Kennedy was killed and also when Martin Luther King was killed, so I knew the effect bad news can have on a session. When the session was over he told me and I thought he was joking and it didn't hit me until I lay down to sleep. The one other time that I experienced that was when my mother and my son died. It wasn't because he wouldn't he doing any more of my songs. It was like a piece of the whole business. I mean some people you just figure are never going to die. Inside, they'll always live. When they're gone, a certain piece goes and you just can't believe it. Reaction of Otis Blackwell, the African-American songwriter, singer, and pianist, whose work significantly influenced rock and roll, to the death of Elvis Presley\n\n\n\nHe would probably be considered a baritone, but he could reach notes that most baritone singers could not. Much of his abilities emanated from a very intense desire to execute a song as he wanted to do it, which meant that he really sang higher than he would normally be able to. When the adrenalin is going, and the song is really pumping, you can get into that mode where you can actually do things, vocally, that you couldn\u2019t normally do. So he had a tremendous range because of his desire to excel and be better, and that\u2019s why he could do a lot of things that most people couldn\u2019t.

It was an amazing time, because the electricity just floated through the air. Everybody there was on cloud nine but he just acted the way a country boy would act.

She taught Elvis Presley music and I\u2019ll tell you a funny story about it. Years later when I asked what he was like, she said \u2018Oh you know, he really was a sweet boy but he didn\u2019t have a lick of talent\u2019 so that tells you something about how we judge talent in our family that\u2019s for sure,\u201d LOL.

It was the \u201cWalking Dead\u201d meets \u201cCaddyshack.\u201d A strange combination.. but the truth. Jon Blauvelt, recalling the way Tiger Woods captivated the attention of thousands upon thousands of people who stormed upon Ponte Vedra Beach for the sole reason of watching him play, as published in the Ponte Vedta Reporter on May 13, 2018.\n\n\n\nBut better Elvis should pay those multimillions in taxes (thereby doing as much for the War on Poverty) than you or I. \"If his manager\", said Goldman, \"had sheltered his income from the taxman and invested it intelligently, Elvis Presley could have been as wealthy as Bob Hope\". Well, I ask you. But I think we can be grateful to Elvis for his grin, his pelvis, his leap, and for the punky, biracial, engaging, ineluctably erotic and still mysterious tenor of his voice. Roy Blount Jr., reviewing Albert Goldman's Elvis, for the NYT in 1981. See also Kelly Phillips Erb's essay on Forbes, focussing on Elvis being his country's highest personal taxpayer for almost a decade.\n\n\n\nHe had an amazing charisma, was so passionate about what he did, and the people could feel it. James Blunt in a 1997 filmed interview\n\n\n\nI remember well the afternoon when Elvis Presley and his mother came into the Tupelo Hardware. He wanted to buy a .22 rifle and his mother wanted him to buy a guitar. I showed him the rifle first and then I got the guitar for him to look at. I put a wood box behind the showcase and let him play the guitar for some time. Then he said he did not have that much money, which was only $7.75 plus a 2% sales tax. His mother told him that if he would buy the guitar instead of the rifle, she would pay the difference for him. The small amount of money that he had to spend had been earned from running errands and doing small jobs for people. Forrest L. Bobo, of the Tupelo Hardware store in Tupelo, MS, in an an affidavit written in 1979 where he confirmed the details of the purchase of Elvis first guitar, a 1940 Kay model, paid for by both Elvis, with his savings, and his mother, for his eleventh birthday and on January 8, 1946.\n\n\n\nI want to do an Elvis Presley song... Andrea Bocelli, as suggested to musician and producer David Foster during the rehearsals for a television special taped in Portofino, Italy, on August 11, 2012. They settled on \"Love me Tender\", one of Bocelli's favourite Elvis songs, with Foster playing the piano. According to Reba McEntire, Elvis is one of Bocelli's favourite singers.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re now trying to get the National Park Service to recognize his home in Louieville as a national historic landmark. Hopefully we can partner with them to continue to run it as a museum, like they\u2019ve done it with Martin Luther Kings home in Atlanta and with Elvis Presley\u2019s home in Memphis. Ali walks among those giants.\u201d George Bochetto, trial lawyer and former Pennsylvania State Boxing Commissioner in an article published at Wave3 on February 24, 2019\n\n\n\nAt age 5, he decided that he wanted to be a musician when his father took him to the Elvis Presley concert in his home town of Sioux City on May 26, 1956.

So here\u2019s these four black young men singing, \u2018Just wanna be your Teddy Bear,\u2019 We just said, \u201cThis is OK, this guy is alright.\u2018 I think my peers thought Elvis Presley was OK. Julian Bond, African American Civil rights leader recalling the time, in 1957, when he and his friends found themselves singing an Elvis song at an ice-breaker event at Atlanta\u2019s prestigious black Morehouse College, as published by the Independent on August 16, 2017.\n\n\n\nWe Germans will never understand U.S. foreign policy.

Elvis Presley.\" The Federal City of Bonn's Public Relations Office on the arrival of PFC Elvis Presley to Germany, on October 3, of 1958.\n\n\n\ni) I recently met with Coretta Scott King, John Lewis and some of the other leaders of the American civil rights movement, and they reminded me of the cultural apartheid rock & roll was up against. I think the hill they climbed would have been much steeper were it not for the racial inroads black music was making on white pop culture. The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival were all introduced to the blues through Elvis. He was already doing what the civil rights movement was demanding: breaking down barriers. You don't think of Elvis as political, but that is politics: changing the way people see the world. ii) In Elvis, you had the whole lot; it's all there in that elastic voice and body. As he changed shape, so did the world. His last performances showcase a voice even bigger than his gut, where you cry real tears as the music messiah sings his tired heart out, turning casino into temple. I think the Vegas period is underrated. I find it the most emotional. By that point Elvis was clearly not in control of his own life, and there is this incredible pathos. The big opera voice of the later years -- that's the one that really hurts me. Bono lead singer of U2, for Rolling Stone Magazine, as published in their April 15, 2004 edition.- 2004 Issue Rolling Stone\n\n\n\nI identify a lot with Elvis. He was a loyal guy and love his style of singing. Jon Bon Jovi as published in http://www.elvis.net/whattheysay/theysayframe.html\n\n\n\nElvis Presley was serving in the military in 1959 when he came under the weather. Doctors diagnosed tonsillitis and suggested that the vocalist, then the biggest performer in the universe, have his tonsils removed. Presley, already more trustworthy than most modern performers in his pleasant acceptance of military duty, agreed. The problem was that no doctor nearby wanted to risk operating on the star, fearing that malpractice would leave him without his golden voice, and either a lawsuit or an an angry fan could ruin any medical career and/or life. They gave him penicillin instead and fortunately everything worked out Ryan Book, in The Music Times Dec 1, 2014\n\n\n\nWhen Bob King and I hosted our radio shows on WBMK and WKGN in the 1980s, we played R&B music of the 1940s through 1969, talked about the music, the artists and stories related to the music industry and revealed the real names of the performers while taking requests from the listeners. We would chuckle as we introduced \u201cThe Twist\u201d by Ernest Evans. How could our audience know that the real name of the man who recorded \u201cIt\u2019s Just a Matter of Time\u201d was Benjamin Franklin Peay? I believe I would have changed my name to Brook Benton, too. Yet one could go from bad to worse. I don\u2019t know why Otha Elias Bates McDaniels changed his name to Bo Diddley. Dinah Washington had 34 top 10 records. She didn\u2019t like her birth name, Ruth Jones, and changed it. Some of the others were James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, with 107 hits during the time we were on the air. Billie Holiday, the great jazz singer changed her name from Eleanor Gough. Many referred to her as Lady Day. Ella Fitzgerald, the most honored jazz singer of all time, won the Down Beat Magazine poll as top female vocalist more than 20 times. Aretha Franklin was the Queen of Soul with 60 numbers on that chart during our broadcast. Although we did not play any Bessie Smith, we knew she had been dubbed Empress of the Blues. Finally, on our shows we recognized Elvis Presley, who had 33 numbers on the R&B chart, as the King of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll. Robert J. Booker African American freelance writer and former executive director of the Beck Cultural Exchange Center, in an article published by the Knoxville News Sentinel on 11 October 2016.\n\n\n\nWe became very good friends, leased homes in Bel Air and visited each other. And back then, in the early 60's of course, I had a wife, and four little children, he was not married, and would come over some afternoons unannounced and visit with me, my wife and my children. They would maybe jump out of the swimming pool, and come running up and get in his lap, and he would become soaking wet, you know, and I would say, 'Girls, don't do that'. And Elvis said, 'Oh, no, let them, let them'. And I knew that he wanted a family. Pat Boone, in an exclusiv3e interview with David Adamas, for elvisaustralia\n\n\n\nHe was not quite a hillbilly, not yet a drugstore cowboy. He was a Southern \u2014 in that word\u2019s connotation of rebellion and slow, sweet charm. Stanley Booth, casting back to the 1950s in his Esquire magazine article \u201cSituation Report: Elvis in Memphis, 1967.\u201d\n\n\n\nI may consider filing a resolution for Indiana to honor Elvis, after all we should do something to recognize the fact that his last concert was here in Indiana. Bruce Borders Representative for the 45th District in the Indiana House of Representatives, former Mayor of Jasonville, Indiana and an Elvis ETA since 1980.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve drafted people who are far, far more important than he is. Chairman of the Memphis Draft Board Stanley Bowers's statement to the media, made public about a month before it became known that he had made a special visit to Graceland, over the 1957 Christmas period, to PERSONALLY inform Elvis of his impending draft, the first time that such a special gesture had ever been made by any Army Board, to any draftee, in the history of the US Armed Forces, as noted in the book, \"Colonel Parker, the Curious life of Elvis' manager\"\n\n\n\nApparently Elvis heard my demos, because we were both on RCA, and Colonel Parker thought I should be introduced to him and maybe the two of us start working in a production-writer capacity. But it never came to pass. I would have loved to have worked with him. God, I would have adored it. He did send me a note once, which read \"All the best, and have a great tour.\" I still have that note. He was a major hero of mine and I was probably stupid to think that having the same birthday as him meant something. David Bowie, commenting on what could have taken place had he and Elvis worked together, as published in interview bowiewonderworld and wwwelvisnet\n\n\n\nMy celebrity crush was Elvis Presley. I got to first meet him with George at Madison Square Garden in 1972.
