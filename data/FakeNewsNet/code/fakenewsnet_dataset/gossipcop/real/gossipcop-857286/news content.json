However, unlike said peers, Oliver\u2019s uber-athletic parkour-trained crime-fighting skills are attributed to his actor's abilities. Now, Amell will get a chance to showcase his skills in real life!\n\nVideo of American Ninja Warrior - Stephen Amell on Ninja Warrior (Sneak Peek)\n\nNBC has released a sneak preview of Stephen Amell's imminently airing American Ninja Warrior run. While the clip obviously doesn't divulge the ultimate outcome, it does show Amell absolutely crushing the early \u2013 but nevertheless difficult \u2013 obstacles of the initial course with athletic ease. Even if Amell ultimately ends up taking an ignominious header into the drink below, the preview already proves that what we see of Oliver Queen's training on Arrow is pretty much ALL Stephen Amell.\n\nAmell's American Ninja Warrior run will air as part of NBC\u2019s upcoming annual celebration of Red Nose Day, showcasing a celebrity edition of the obstacle course mainstay series. As the preview reveals, Stephen Amell will shed Oliver Queen and the Green Arrow to participate in television\u2019s ultimate obstacle course proving ground. The special edition will pair celebrities with veteran participants called \u201cElite Ninjas,\u201d who will act in a coaching capacity as the celebs navigate the elaborately arduous courses. Amell will be partnered with the show\u2019s female standout and poster-woman Kacy Cantanzaro.\n\nAdditionally, the Red Nose Day edition of American Ninja Warrior will see celebs Erika Christensen (Parenthood) pair with Flip Rodriguez, Derek Hough (Dancing with the Stars) with Daniel Gil, Natalie Morales (NBC\u2019s Today) with Grant McCartney, Ashton Eaton (Olympic gold medalist) with Kevin Bull, Nikki Glaser (comedian/host) with Jessie Graff, Nick Swisher (former Yankees outfielder) with Drew Drechsel, Jeff Dye (comedian) with Meagan Martin and film star Mena Suvaru (American Beauty, the American Pie movies) with Natalie Duran.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVideo of (Arrow Stephen Amell) - Parkour Superhero Workout\n\nFor Amell, who trains vigorously in parkour and obstacle courses (as seen in the 2014 video above), running the American Ninja Warrior Course won\u2019t even be his first high-profile real life challenge. The actor previously took on a scripted-but-perilous run in the WWE for a headline-generating feud with the wrestling company\u2019s now-former superstar Stardust (n\u00e9e Cody Rhodes), culminating in a four-man tag-team match in which Amell, teamed with Neville, shined in a SummerSlam 2015 battle against Stardust and King Barrett. He\u2019ll be in more comfortable form on the Ninja Warrior obstacle course, since its elements resemble his onscreen crime-fighting exploits and training, notably the core-killing bar ascension of the Salmon Ladder.\n\nArrow fans will want to catch Stephen Amell running the course on American Ninja Warrior when the Red Nose Day celebrity edition brings awareness to both African famine relief efforts and Amell\u2019s real life talents. The episode airs on NBC on May 25.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=759786230837826&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn2us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/16x9_460/public/2019/07/spider-man-far-from-home-ending-explained.jpg?itok=lPzKRaCB", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036152&c3=&c4=https%3A//www.denofgeek.us/us/tv/arrow/263527/arrow-star-stephen-amell-runs-american-ninja-warrior-course&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/16x9_460/public/2019/04/warrior-andrew-koji-cinemax.jpg?itok=AwqxPCAY", "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/16x9_460/public/2016/11/harry-potter-movies.png?itok=LwcMPT87", "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/16x9_460/public/2018/05/the-100-season-6-official-renewal.jpg?itok=q6SFh4Yd", "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/2017/04/stephen-amell-arrow-season-5.jpg", "https://cdn2us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/themes/denofgeek_us/logo.png", "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/16x9_460/public/2019/01/the-good-place-season-4.jpg?itok=y5BlnIPd", "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/main_wide/public/2017/04/stephen-amell-arrow-season-5.jpg?itok=iUb0Rf2M", "https://cdn2us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/styles/16x9_460/public/2019/07/rip_torn_career_retrospective.jpg?itok=5qcajOl6", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-zxDb3fg08cw8W.gif?labels=_fp.event.Default"], "top_img": "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/2017/04/stephen-amell-arrow-season-5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/arrow/263527/arrow-star-stephen-amell-runs-american-ninja-warrior-course", "title": "Arrow Star Stephen Amell Runs American Ninja Warrior Course", "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "Den of Geek", "url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/263527", "title": "Arrow Star Stephen Amell Runs American Ninja Warrior Course", "image": "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/2017/04/stephen-amell-arrow-season-5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Arrow\u2019s Stephen Amell tests his parkour training in an upcoming celebrity edition of American Ninja Warrior."}, "twitter": {"card": "photo", "url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/arrow/263527/arrow-star-stephen-amell-runs-american-ninja-warrior-course", "image": "https://cdn1us.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeekus/files/2017/04/stephen-amell-arrow-season-5.jpg", "site": {"identifier": "DenofGeekUS", "id": 23847132}, "creator": "@DenofGeekUs", "description": "Arrow\u2019s Stephen Amell tests his parkour training in an upcoming celebrity edition of American Ninja Warrior.", "title": "Arrow Star Stephen Amell Runs American Ninja Warrior Course"}, "copyright": "Dennis Publishing Limited, licensed by Felden", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.6, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "description": "Arrow\u2019s Stephen Amell tests his parkour training in an upcoming celebrity edition of American Ninja Warrior."}, "movies": ["//www.youtube.com/embed/baHfmHeySkE?wmode=opaque", "//www.youtube.com/embed/ZaoEbd1Bj7w?wmode=opaque"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.denofgeek.com", "summary": ""}
