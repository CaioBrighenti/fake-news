We have similar ways of work. The fact that we know each other and trust each other helps,\" Cruz said, according to the outlet, noting that fans shouldn't expect them to exclusively work together. \"That will be once in a while, if we feel it's right. I don't think it will be too often.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old actress also opened up about how her acting style has evolved. \"When I was in my 20s, I thought the more I would torture myself and the more I would stay in character for months, the better the result would be,\" she recalled. \"I learned it's not really related to that. I have a life and I have a job. That allows me to jump from reality to fiction.\"\n\nCruz and Bardem also co-star in Loving Pablo, in which he plays Pablo Escober and she plays his mistress, Virginia Vallejo.
