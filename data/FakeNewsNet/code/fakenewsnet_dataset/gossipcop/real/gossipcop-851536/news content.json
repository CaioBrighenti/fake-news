Since then, the two have been spotted together many times. But their relationship might not be as close as it seems, and it\u2019s definitely not as close as it once was.\n\nThe two sisters were extremely close growing up\n\nKate and Pippa Middleton are less than two years apart. Growing up, the sisters were best friends. The girls grew up with their parents and brother and spent nearly every day together \u2014 the two were also very close with their younger brother, James Middleton. Kate has said that she wants to recreate the family dynamic she had while growing up and have a big, close-knit family. However, royalty can get in the way of close family relationships.\n\nNext: It\u2019s hard to forget Pippa\u2019s shining moment.\n\nPippa stole the show at Kate\u2019s wedding\n\nIt was no secret that Pippa turned heads at William and Kate\u2019s 2011 wedding. Pippa, then 27, nearly crashed Twitter when she showed up in a white dress with a neckline that didn\u2019t seem fit for a royal wedding. The following day, there was just as much news about Pippa as there was about William and Kate. Although Kate didn\u2019t have much to say about her sister overshadowing her big day, we\u2019d like to think she probably wished she\u2019d chosen a different outfit for her maid of honor.\n\nNext: Here\u2019s why Kate didn\u2019t get revenge on Pippa\u2019s wedding day.\n\n\u2026 And Kate didn\u2019t want the same for her sister\n\nWhen Pippa tied the knot with now-husband James Matthews in 2017, Kate did not play a role in her wedding. Why? Because the Duchess of Cambridge didn\u2019t want to steal the spotlight on her sister\u2019s big day. Instead, Kate decided she wanted to be in the background as much as possible, and only Prince George and Princess Charlotte would be in Pippa\u2019s wedding. Perhaps that\u2019s because Kate knows what it felt like to have someone else steal the limelight at your wedding.\n\nNext: Rumors swirled about Kate\u2019s feelings toward Pippa\u2019s fianc\u00e9.\n\nThere were rumors about Kate being annoyed with her sister\u2019s engagement\n\nMultiple reports came out after Pippa\u2019s engagement that claimed Kate was not happy with Pippa\u2019s \u201cwild\u201d fianc\u00e9. Reports also claimed that Pippa was sick of Kate\u2019s judgmental attitude, and the two were not getting along since Pippa\u2019s big news. However, William and Kate did release a statement saying they were very happy for Kate\u2019s sister. While the royals always show proper poise and respect, it\u2019s unclear if they released the statement just to avoid the publicized drama, or if they were actually perfectly fine with Pippa tying the knot.\n\nNext: The relationship isn\u2019t like it was growing up.\n\nThey don\u2019t see each other that often\n\nKate is a royal. Royals have things to do. As a result, Kate and Pippa don\u2019t spend as much time together as they used to. When Kate married into the royal family, she gave up any hope of a normal life \u2014 which included normal hangouts with her younger sister. The two can\u2019t wander into a coffee shop together without everyone turning heads. They can\u2019t go on a shopping date anymore without tight-knit security. Spending carefree time with one another is a thing of the past, and those strict rules are bound to have some kind of impact on anyone.\n\nNext: Kate\u2019s husband had some words for Pippa.\n\nThe royal family has a different way of life\n\nPippa Middleton\u2019s career plans were put on hold by her sister\u2019s new family. E! Online reported that when Pippa wanted a career in television, she was \u201creined in\u201d by her brother-in-law, who wasn\u2019t happy with the wave of attention Pippa received at his wedding. A friend of Pippa\u2019s told The Daily Mail, \u201cIt was felt by William in particular that she needed some guidance and support.\u201d When Pippa had to be told how to live by her sister\u2019s new husband\u2019s standards, it likely caused some tension in the sisterly relationship.\n\nNext: The royal family keeps growing, which makes Kate and Pippa\u2019s relationship shrink.\n\nKids always make things more complicated\n\nThis goes for any relationship. Once kids are thrown into the mix, it becomes even harder to maintain a close relationship with your siblings. Especially since Kate\u2019s kids happen to include two princes and princess. It\u2019s possible that when Pippa and her new husband decide to have a baby, the families can have play dates all day every day. However, with Kate trying to raise three little ones, and royal little ones nonetheless, it\u2019s easy to drift from those who used to know you best.\n\nNext: An inside look at Kate\u2019s other relationships with the royal family\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nRoyal relation to Kate: sister-in-law\n\nKate and Meghan Markle have met many times, and Prince Harry\u2019s wife has also spent time with Kate and William\u2019s children. Considering Kate\u2019s affinity for her brother-in-law it\u2019s no surprise sources say she defended her sister-in-law as the media reported about Markle\u2019s previous divorce and sometimes-racy career.\n\nRoyal protocol doesn\u2019t allow for a best man or maid of honor at royal weddings, but Prince William broke this rule when Harry was his best man in 2011. Harry returned the favor \u2014 and while it was rumored that Kate could be Markle\u2019s matron of honor, the Duchess of Sussex chose not to have a maid of honor at her nuptials.\n\nNext: A controversial cousin in Kate\u2019s corner\n\nPrincess Eugenie\n\nRoyal relation to Kate: cousin-in-law\n\nThe media noticed awkward dynamics between Princess Eugenie and Kate early on. But things seem better in recent years. Of course, Eugenie remains most loyal to her sister, Princess Beatrice (more on that drama later). But Eugenie is reportedly on good terms with the whole family, especially Princes William and Harry.\n\nIn January 2017, Buckingham Palace announced Eugenie\u2019s engagement to long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank. Both the royal family and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family expressed delight over the upcoming nuptials. It seems the princess has a future of her own to focus on.\n\nNext: Everyone can see the tension between Kate and this royal.\n\nPrincess Beatrice\n\nRoyal relation to Kate: cousin-in-law\n\nSarah, Duchess of York (commonly known as Fergie) has long caused a rift in the royal family. So much so that it created tension between her daughters, Princess Beatrice and Eugenie, and the rest of the royal family. Many believe this rift translated to the girls not liking Kate \u2014 although Eugenie seems to have warmed up to her cousin-in-law.\n\nPrincess Beatrice is reportedly quite icy toward Kate, feeling sidelined due to Kate\u2019s place and popularity in the royal family, especially with her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. The feud between the two women regularly steals headlines.\n\nNext: A 22-year age gap doesn\u2019t hurt this relationship.\n\nLady Louise of Windsor\n\nRoyal relation to Kate: cousin-in-law\n\nDaughter of Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, Lady Louise caught the public\u2019s attention when she served as one of Kate\u2019s adorable bridesmaids in 2011. Since then, Louise and Kate have enjoyed many public outings together. Despite their age difference (Louise is 14 and Kate is 36), the queen\u2019s granddaughters get along swimmingly. They\u2019re often seen chatting and laughing while representing the royal family.\n\nNext: The important relationship Kate maintains \u2014 outside her marriage.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nRoyal relation to Kate: grandmother-in-law\n\nSome relatives seem to have a problem with the attention Kate Middleton receives. It\u2019s not surprising because she clearly maintains one of the best relationships with Queen Elizabeth. Kate reportedly dated Prince William for a while before meeting the queen for the first time at Peter and Autumn Phillips\u2019 wedding. She and her royal grandmother have only grown closer since then.\n\nAdditional reporting by Chelena Goldman.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-Middleton-640x426.jpg?x46112", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kate-Middleton-and-Pippa-Middleton-640x426.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-Middleton-and-James-Mathews-640x476.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kate-Middleton-and-Princess-Eugenie--640x408.png?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-880238024.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Catherine-Duchess-of-Cambridge-and-Lady-Louise-Windsor.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-and-Kate-Middleton-640x488.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kate-Middleton-and-Princess-Beatrie-603x500.png?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Prince-George-and-Princess-Charlotte-640x470.png?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-and-Kate-Middleton-640x488.jpg?x46112", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-818697344-640x445.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Queen-Elizabeth-II-and-The-Duke-And-Duchess-Of-Cambridge-Visit-The-East-Midlands-603x500.jpg?x46112", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-Middleton-at-a-skiing-event-640x431.jpg?x46112"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-and-Kate-Middleton-640x488.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Mullaney"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/signs-pippa-and-kate-middletons-relationship-isnt-as-royalty-proof-as-everyone-thinks.html/", "title": "Signs Pippa and Kate Middleton\u2019s Relationship Isn\u2019t as Royalty-Proof as Everyone Thinks", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/signs-pippa-and-kate-middletons-relationship-isnt-as-royalty-proof-as-everyone-thinks.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "The two sisters were close growing up, but with one of them constantly in the spotlight, they aren't as close as they seem.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Signs Pippa and Kate Middleton\u2019s Relationship Isn't as Royalty-Proof as Everyone Thinks", "description": "The two sisters were close growing up, but with one of them constantly in the spotlight, they aren't as close as they seem.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/signs-pippa-and-kate-middletons-relationship-isnt-as-royalty-proof-as-everyone-thinks.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "updated_time": "2018-05-21T18:20:24+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-and-Kate-Middleton-640x488.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-and-Kate-Middleton-640x488.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wallstcheatsheet", "tag": "relationship advice", "section": "Health & Fitness", "published_time": "2018-05-19T12:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-21T18:20:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The two sisters were close growing up, but with one of them constantly in the spotlight, they aren't as close as they seem.", "title": "Signs Pippa and Kate Middleton\u2019s Relationship Isn't as Royalty-Proof as Everyone Thinks", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Pippa-and-Kate-Middleton-640x488.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "position": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526733000.0, "source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
