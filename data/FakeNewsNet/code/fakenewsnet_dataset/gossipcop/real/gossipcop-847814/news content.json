DL1961 denim is pure cotton, eco-friendly, anti-bacterial, and is a hybrid elastane, which allows for shape retention and 360-degree movement, making it the perfect comfortable material for travel.\n\nDL1961 Vince Casual Straight Jeans\n\nJust like its women\u2019s styles, DL1961 makes a comfy jean from its signature denim for men. The Vince Casual Straight-Leg Jean comes in a variety of washes and colors that will suit all travel needs and styles.

The Super Skinny style is made of extra stretch heavyweight denim, has 3.5 percent elastane, and fits any body shape flawlessly.

They come in a variety of colors, patterns, and washes, so it\u2019s worth investing in a few pairs if you like their fit for maximum versatility.\n\nFleece-Lined Denim\n\nNothing says pajamas more than a pair of comfy fleece sweatpants or leggings. Well, luckily there are several fleece-lined jeans for both men and women out there that give you that extra comfort and warmth. For women, try a pair of Camii Mia Women\u2019s Slim Fit Fleece Skinny Jeans; and men, the Lee Men\u2019s Relaxed-Fit Jeans are a good option.\n\nMelissa McCarthy Seven7 Women\u2019s Plus-Size Roll Straight Jean\n\nMelissa McCarthy Seven7 denim is the perfect denim line for plus size travelers.
