ABC\n\nIn the world of reality dating shows, talking about your past relationships and sex life is par for the course, but few would think that extended to the show's producers.\n\nYet that's exactly what a former segment producer for \" The Bachelor\" claims happened to her in a new complaint against Warner Bros., which produces the show.\n\nBecky Steenhoek \u2014 who worked on the production for the 2016 season of \" The Bachelorette\" with JoJo Fletcher\u2014 filed a lawsuit on Monday in the Los Angeles Superior Court and spoke with the Los Angeles Times about what occurred between her and five other producers, who were also named along with Warner Bros. in the complaint.\n\nSteenhoek, 31, says that the show's executive and cast producers named in the complaint would ask her personal questions that were extremely sexual in nature, including about her personal grooming habits, sex life, and masturbation.\n\n\"You could visibly tell it was very uncomfortable to me to witness, just because they did make comments like, 'Oh, Becky's blushing,' or 'Her ears are probably burning,'\" Steenhoek told The Times, adding that her colleagues' questions made her uncomfortable.\n\nWhen she asked her female coworker Caitlin Stapleton \u2014 a cast producer on the show \u2014 what to do about it, Steenhoek said Stapleton told her that was just \"the way of the industry and world that we work in,\" adding that the behavior was \"locker-room talk\" and a way to bond.\n\nSteenhoek said after confiding in Stapleton, her job markedly changed from attending production meetings to fetching meals for her bosses before being told she wasn't needed for the remainder of the season. When she asked why, she said she was told it was because she wasn't enough of a \"bitch.\"\n\nSteenhoek was a producer on Fletcher's season of \"The Bachelorette.\" ABC\n\nSteenhoek is now suing Warner Bros., \"Bachelor\" creator Mike Fleiss' production company NZK Productions, as well as producers Elan Gale, Peter Scalettar, Jacqueline Naz Perez, Bennett Graebner, and Stapleton for \"damages related to sexual harassment and hostile work environment, sex discrimination, retaliation, failure to prevent harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful termination,\" according to the LA Times.\n\nIn a statement to INSIDER, Warner Bros. said it had previously investigated Steenhoek's claims and didn't feel their findings supported her claims. Read the full statement below:\n\n\"We take all allegations of workplace harassment very seriously. These allegations were brought to our attention and were thoroughly investigated earlier this year. Our findings did not support the plaintiff's characterization of the events claimed to have taken place, which is why we are disappointed by the filing of this lawsuit.\"\n\nSteenhoek's lawsuit comes at a time when powerful industry players in Hollywood like producer Harvey Weinstein or director James Toback are being accused of sexual harassment. And it's not just in Hollywood \u2014 many powerful men are now being accused of sexual misconduct, including Ben Affleck and Kevin Spacey.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58c6c7e1dd0895df4b8b4c6b-960-480.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58c6c7e1dd0895df4b8b4c6a-750-563.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58c6c7e1dd0895df4b8b4c6b-960-480.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Willett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/former-bachelor-staffer-sexual-harassment-allegations-2017-10", "title": "A former 'Bachelor' staffer says she was crudely sexually harassed by producers and told it was just 'locker-room talk'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-10-31", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-31", "news_keywords": "The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, JoJo Fletcher, Warner Bros., Megan Willett", "sailthru.tags": "The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, JoJo Fletcher, Warner Bros., Megan Willett", "description": "A former producer for \"The Bachelor\" franchise who worked on JoJo Fletcher's season of \"The Bachelorette\" filed a complaint to say she was sexually harassed.", "sailthru.description": "A former producer for \"The Bachelor\" franchise who worked on JoJo Fletcher's season of \"The Bachelorette\" filed a complaint to say she was sexually harassed.", "title": "A former 'Bachelor' staffer says she was crudely sexually harassed by producers and told it was just 'locker-room talk'", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire-contributor, thewire", "sailthru.title": "A former 'Bachelor' staffer says she was crudely sexually harassed by producers and told it was just 'locker-room talk'", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58c6c7e1dd0895df4b8b4c6b-960-480.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58c6c7e1dd0895df4b8b4c6a-960-720.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58c6c7e1dd0895df4b8b4c6a-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment Contributors", "sailthru.author": "Megan Willett", "og": {"title": "A former 'Bachelor' staffer says she was crudely sexually harassed by producers and told it was just 'locker-room talk'", "description": "A former producer for \"The Bachelor\" franchise who worked on JoJo Fletcher's season of \"The Bachelorette\" filed a complaint to say she was sexually harassed.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/former-bachelor-staffer-sexual-harassment-allegations-2017-10", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58c6c7e1dd0895df4b8b4c6b-960-480.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Megan Willett, INSIDER", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/former-bachelor-staffer-sexual-harassment-allegations-2017-10", "title": "A former 'Bachelor' staffer says she was crudely sexually harassed by producers and told it was just 'locker-room talk'", "description": "A former producer for \"The Bachelor\" franchise who worked on JoJo Fletcher's season of \"The Bachelorette\" filed a complaint to say she was sexually harassed.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58c6c7e1dd0895df4b8b4c6b-960-480.jpg", "creator": "@MegaWillz", "site": "@bi_contributors"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "A former 'Bachelor' staffer says she was crudely sexually harassed by producers and told it was just 'locker-room talk'": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509422400.0, "source": "http://uk.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
