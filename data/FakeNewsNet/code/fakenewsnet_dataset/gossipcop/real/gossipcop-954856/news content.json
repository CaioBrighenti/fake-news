He may be coming to a reality show near you, as will his wife. And of course, there is the Fox interest to join the broadcast booth. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) April 27, 2018\n\nCutler, 34, was a first-round pick by the Denver Broncos in 2006. He teased at a possible retirement before last season, but opted instead to sign a 1-year, $10 million contract with Miami. The Vanderbilt graduate was expected to become an analyst for FOX before returning to football.\n\nCutler has played 12 seasons in the NFL for the Broncos, Chicago Bears and Dolphins. He has made just two playoff game appearances, throwing for a combined 354 yards, two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nLast season, Cutler took over the starting role from the injured Ryan Tannehill and threw for 2,666 yards, 19 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/swim-daily-newsletter.svg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/MMQB-newsletter.svg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/MMQB-newsletter-horizontal.svg", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1730_top1.jpg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/Extra-Mustard-newsletter.svg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/fansided-newsletter.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1730_top2.jpg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/sportsIllustrated-newsletter.svg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nihal Kolur"], "canonical_link": "https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement-television-return", "title": "Report: Jay Cutler Expected to Retire, May Return to TV", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "jay cutler,jay cutler retirement,jay cutler nfl,jay cutler tv,jay cutler fox,jay cutler bears,NFL", "news_keywords": "jay cutler,jay cutler retirement,jay cutler nfl,jay cutler tv,jay cutler fox,jay cutler bears,NFL", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-27 05:25:49", "sailthru.tags": "jay-cutler,jay-cutler-retirement,jay-cutler-nfl,jay-cutler-tv,jay-cutler-fox,jay-cutler-bears,nfl", "description": "Cutler flirted with retirement before joining the Dolphins last season.", "og": {"title": "Report: Jay Cutler expected to retire, may return to TV", "type": "article", "site_name": "SI.com", "url": "https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement-television-return", "description": "Cutler flirted with retirement before joining the Dolphins last season.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement-television-return", "description": "Cutler flirted with retirement before joining the Dolphins last season.", "media": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement-television-return", "title": "Report: Jay Cutler expected to retire, may return to TV", "description": "Cutler flirted with retirement before joining the Dolphins last season.", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement.jpg&w=1024&h=512&c=sc&poi=face&q=85"}, "fb": {"app_id": 165082593548215, "pages": 10053803772}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524801600.0, "source": "https://www.si.com", "summary": ""}
