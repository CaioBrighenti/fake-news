In it, Jackson is seen wearing his iconic white sequin glove.\n\n\u201cI will never feel love again the way I did with you,\u201d her post continued. \u201cYou are always with me and I am always with you. Though I am not you, and you are not me, I know with all my being that we are one. And our souls will never change in that way. Thank you for the magic, forever and always.\u201d\n\nIn what Rolling Stone dubbed as her \u201cfirst-ever in-depth interview\u201d following her father\u2019s June 2009 death, the model-actress opened up about the close-knit relationship she had with her father, saying, \u201cI feel him with me all the time.\u201d She was 11 years old when she spoke at his memorial service on July 7, 2009, calling him the \u201cbest father you could ever imagine.\u201d\n\nJackson, who is currently filming the second season of Fox\u2019s \u201cStar,\u201d is the sole daughter of mother, Debbie Rowe, and father. She has two brothers, older sibling Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. and the younger Prince Michael Jackson II.", "images": ["https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.18542387.1558099083!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_384/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14097094.1504016525!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_768/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.25689207.1546961346!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_384/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11926572.1561394050!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_384/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.33645903.1562703326!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_384/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14097094.1504016525!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpg", "https://www.amny.com/img/amny/wit-m.png", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.33638742.1562690207!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_384/image.jpg", "https://www.amny.com/img/loaders/landscape.png", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.33720410.1562865758!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_384/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.15522124.1513717837!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/mugshot_88/image.jpg", "https://www.amny.com/img/amnyLogo.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14097094.1504016525!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meghan Giannotta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.amny.com/entertainment/celebrities/paris-jackson-sends-birthday-wishes-to-dad-michael-thanks-for-the-magic-1.14097090", "title": "Paris Jackson sends birthday wishes to dad Michael: Thanks for the magic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Michael Jackson\u2019s daughter, Paris, thanked the late music icon \u201cfor the magic\u201d in an Instagram post early Tuesday morning, on what would have been the King of Pop\u2019s 59th birthday. \u201cBirthday wishes to", "msvalidate.01": "AC41EB10D1EC6B5358F0ECA0E861CCAA", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/amny/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/amny/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/amny/widetile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/amny/largetile.png", "google-site-verification": "tfHRWskwvb3GGHo27-npDYgKftWmFR1ELSf20LrqufY", "application-name": "am New York", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0083d3", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/amnewyork/amny-win8-logo.png", "fb": {"pages": 20325742960, "app_id": 232966353382852}, "ia": {"markup_url": "http://www.amny.com/facebook/entertainment/celebrities/paris-jackson-sends-birthday-wishes-to-dad-michael-thanks-for-the-magic-1.14097090"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free"}, "news_keywords": "entertainment,celebrities,source,amny", "og": {"title": "Paris Jackson pens letter to dad: Thanks for the magic", "url": "https://www.amny.com/entertainment/celebrities/paris-jackson-sends-birthday-wishes-to-dad-michael-thanks-for-the-magic-1.14097090", "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14097094.1504016525!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpg", "site_name": "am New York", "description": "Michael Jackson\u2019s daughter, Paris, thanked the late music icon \u201cfor the magic\u201d in an Instagram post early Tuesday morning, on what would have been the King of Pop\u2019s 59th birthday. \u201cBirthday wishes to", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@amNewYork", "title": "Paris Jackson pens letter to dad: Thanks for the magic", "description": "Michael Jackson\u2019s daughter, Paris, thanked the late music icon \u201cfor the magic\u201d in an Instagram post early Tuesday morning, on what would have been the King of Pop\u2019s 59th birthday. \u201cBirthday wishes to", "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14097094.1504016525!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpg", "creator": "@@MeghGia", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 449455827, "ipad": 449455827, "googleplay": "com.phonegap.amny"}}}, "sailthru.date": "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 10:41:52 -0400", "sailthru.title": "Paris Jackson pens letter to dad: Thanks for the magic", "sailthru.tags": "entertainment,celebrities,source,amny", "sailthru.author": "Meghan Giannotta", "isDesktop": "true"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504021312.0, "source": "https://www.amny.com", "summary": ""}
