No one does that better than Lady Gaga, and her 2018 Grammys look didn't disappoint. Last year saw Gaga go dark with a rock and roll theme and PVC leather (complete with a fake tattoo for the occasion), but this year, the only thing that's stayed constant is the color black and her love of spectacle. To top off her ornate black Armani Priv\u00e9 gown, Lady Gaga went with a look that's all about contrast: black and pale makeup, platinum hair, and a braid that's wrapped in a literal black corset.\n\nCreated by Gaga's go-to hairstylist, Frederic Aspiras, her hair is nothing if not on theme. Aspiras pulled Gaga's long, white-blond hair into two complex French braids on either side of her head, and then laced the sides together with black ribbon until they met on her braid's tail. Corset braids (while certainly not new) have had a resurgence thanks to Instagram, and black ribbon is in the middle of a huge red carpet moment. Gaga's version blends the two trends in a way that's so cool it hurts.\n\nChristopher Polk\n\nAs for the makeup, her artist Sarah Tanno went with a balmy pink Marc Jacobs lipstick (Cream & Sugar to be exact) and a shimmering lavender highlight to keep the vibe from veering too heavy. Gaga's been experimenting with her aesthetic over the last few years, but this combination is a straight-up return to her Mother Monster days.\n\nWe'll just go ahead and leave you with these photos. Enjoy!
