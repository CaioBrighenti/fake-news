No premiere date has been slated for Season 2.\n\nIn \u201cRaven\u2019s Home,\u201d Raven-Symon\u00e9 plays her original role from \u201cThat\u2019s So Raven,\u201d which aired from 2003 through 2007. She is also an executive producer on the comedy series, which follows longtime best friends Raven (Raven-Symon\u00e9) and Chelsea (original \u201cThat\u2019s So Raven\u201d star Anneliese van der Pol) who are each divorced with kids of their own and living in one household. Unbeknownst to the kids, Raven still catches glimpses of the future, and unbeknownst to Raven, her son has discovered he has the same ability to see into the future.\n\nAbout one year ago, Raven-Symon\u00e9 departed \u201cThe View,\u201d on which she was a co-host from 2015-2016, to develop \u201cRaven\u2019s Home\u201d with Disney Channel, which required her to move from New York to Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud of our first season and the fact that Raven has returned home to Disney Channel in a very big way. The entire cast and crew have delivered a classic family sitcom that kids and families will be watching for many years to come,\u201d said Adam Bonnett, Disney Channels Worldwide\u2019s executive vice president of original programming.\n\n\u201cRaven\u2019s Home\u201d is currently in the midst of its first season, which debuted this past July, becoming the top live-action cable television series premiere of the past two years among Kids 6-11 (1.3 million viewers), Tweens 9-14 (1.5 million) and Kids 2-11 (1.6 million). Since premiering, the show has performed strongly in its Friday 8 p.m. timeslot and has become Disney Channel\u2019s No.1 streamed series with nearly 4.5 million viewers on YouTube and 10 million VOD views.\n\n\u201cRaven\u2019s Home\u201d was developed by Scott Thomas and Jed Elinoff, and created by \u201cThat\u2019s So Raven\u201d creators Michael Poryes and Susan Sherman. Dava Savel and Michael Feldman are executive producers with Raven-Symon\u00e9.
