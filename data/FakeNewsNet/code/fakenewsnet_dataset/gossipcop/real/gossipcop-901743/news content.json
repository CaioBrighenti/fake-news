The past four years have been the stage for Katy Perry and Taylor Swift to take down each other very publicly. They have been at each others\u2019 necks since 2014 because of an argument over backing dances. It now seems as though the fight has come to an end as Katy took the first step forward to make peace by sending Taylor an olive branch.\n\nAn olive branch is obviously a symbol of peace, so we suppose both are meant to forgive the fact that Taylor wrote Bad Blood about Katy and that Katy\u2019s Swish Swish is a dig at Taylor. It seems like that is the case. Taylor posted on the package Katy sent her on her Instagram Story.\n\nKaty Perry sent Taylor an olive branch for the opening night of the reputation Stadium Tour! pic.twitter.com/6GDamcxezI \u2014 Taylor Swift Updates (@TSwiftPR) May 8, 2018\n\nIn the video, Taylor said:\n\n\u201cI just got to my dressing room and found this actual olive branch. This means so much to me.\u201d\n\nThere was a note from Katy too but it was a little harder to read. Swift fans are sceptical, is this an actual truce or is Katy scheming?\n\nWhat do you think?", "images": ["https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/220px-Shawn_Mendes_-_If_I_Cant_Have_You-170x170.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/play-icon.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Downloadontheappstore.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2320503108178784&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/HeartFm-Logo.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/katy-perry-taylor.jpg", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Heart-90s_logo_190_95.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/katy-perry-taylor-624x337.jpg", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/heart_logo_190_95.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FooterBKG.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/I-Dont-Care-1557434265-640x640-170x170.jpg", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Heart-Lounge_logo_190_95.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Taylor_Swift_-_Me-170x170.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/220px-Katy_Perry_-_Never_Really_Over-170x170.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/HeartFm-Logo.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GetitonAndroid.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/220px-Tom_Walker_-_Just_You_and_I-170x170.png", "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Heart-Legends_logo_190_95.png"], "top_img": "https://iheartuae.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/katy-perry-taylor.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://iheartuae.com/2018/05/10/katy-perry-taylor-swift-call-a-truce-finally/", "title": "Katy Perry & Taylor Swift call a truce, finally", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Every\u00a0year has a feud that marks it.
