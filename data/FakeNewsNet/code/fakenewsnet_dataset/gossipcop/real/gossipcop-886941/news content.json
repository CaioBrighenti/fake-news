Kardashian and Richie also walked on the beach together as the kids \u2014 Mason, 9, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 4 \u2014 played in the sand.\n\nKardashian opted for a black two-piece swimsuit, which she later partially covered up with a dark mini-skirt, while Richie wore an orange bikini and Disick rocked leopard-print swim trunks and a blue t-shirt.\n\nGiving her seal of approval, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian tweeted in response to a fan who called her sister\u2019s vacation \u201cco-parenting done right!!\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyond proud of all of them!!!!
