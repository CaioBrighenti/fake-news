I spent it in the hospital... with my brand new daughter who was born right before St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\"\n\nThe new child, whose name has not been revealed, is the second of Macklemore's children. Sloane Ava Simone, his first daughter, is now 2 and a half. The rapper has her name tattooed on his chest. View a picture of Sloane, via Macklemore's Instagram, below.\n\nNeither Macklemore, nor his wife, have shared the big announcement on social media just yet.\n\nMacklemore is currently on tour in the U.K. This summer, he will join Kesha on a co-headlining North American tour.
