Which is understandable. This is one of the first shows written with binge-watching in mind, unfolding like a long, engrossing novel. Episodes don\u2019t really have arcs, they\u2019re just chapters in the longer narrative. If you give the series time, it delivers a story as grim as its Florida Keys setting, all palm-dotted and picturesque, is gorgeous. Like too few shows do, Bloodline has a richly realized sense of place, the melancholy island breezes and ominous storm clouds rolling in off electric-blue water giving a classical family saga\u2014about a black sheep returning to the flock, with disastrous results\u2014the weight of something mythic. Bloodline also boasts one of the best performances by any actor, in any medium, this year: Ben Mendelsohn\u2019s devious, pitiful, funny, scary, tragic Danny is a character for the ages, brilliantly brought to life by an actor working at the height of his powers. If you\u2019re in need of the TV equivalent of a literary beach read, Bloodline is the show for you. \u2014 Richard Lawson", "images":
