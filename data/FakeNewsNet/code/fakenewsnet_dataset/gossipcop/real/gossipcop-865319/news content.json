Love Ben,\u201d Macklemore \u2013 aka Ben Haggerty \u2013 writes in comments on YouTube.\n\nSchott, who lives in Modesto, is brought to tears when she opens her front door to see her famous grandson standing there.\n\n\u201cOh my God, what are you doing here, honey?\u201d she exclaims, telling him later, \u201cYou made me cry.\u201d\n\nShe asks him what he wants to do. \u201cYou want to go outside and have a drink? No, you don\u2019t drink. Just me. I took up your habits,\u201d she says, laughing.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re going to do whatever you want to do,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnything?\u201d she says. \u201cOh God, I want to do it all.\u201d\n\nAnd they darn nearly do it all.\n\nThey egg someone\u2019s house. (Then Grandma flips the bird toward her unseen nemesis.)\n\nThey\u2019re off to buy sensible shoes. (Granny wants Yeezys instead, and gets them.)\n\nThey sing karaoke, play games at the arcade, race through the grocery store in electric shopping carts and Schott watches her grandson get another tattoo. This one says, \u201cHelen.\u201d\n\nAnd, of course, they stop at the thrift shop.\n\nBack home, Macklemore has one more surprise for his grandma \u2013 a fireman stripper.\n\nAwwww. What a good grandson, the internet has declared.\n\nIt seems Macklemore has unleashed a tsunami of grandma love.\n\n\u201cSweetest music video I\u2019ve seen!\u201d writes one YouTube commenter. \u201cMakes me wish my grandma was still alive and well to go on adventures with.
