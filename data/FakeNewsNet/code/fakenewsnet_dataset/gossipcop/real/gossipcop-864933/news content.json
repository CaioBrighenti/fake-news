I'll just point out that it is the act of a giant pussy,\" she concluded. \"Here is a man who's afraid of germs, stairs, books, unprocessed food, women, birds, Muslims, Russian pee tapes, inner cities and, of course, strong winds. But he can't recognize the courage of people who survived literal war zones to come to a new country, start over with nothing and keep going each day despite the contempt with which we're horrible enough to treat them.\"\n\n\"You want a Muslim ban? We know you do, so say it already,\" she said to Trump. \"Own your pointless cruelty. That is why America voted for you \u2026 except for the majority of America that didn't.\"", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_square_270x270/2017/03/snaps-maddow-about-the-trump-show-continues-on-the-hollywood-reporter_1a.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_square_270x270/2019/07/gettyimages-1131636195-h_2019.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_landscape_960x541/2017/03/ans_split.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_square_270x270/2019/06/spider-man-_far_from_home-publicity_still_6-h_2019.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/list_landscape_960x541/2016/04/gettyimages-516879504.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/ans_split.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/ans_split.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kara Haar"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/14-hollywood-stars-who-immigrated-us-became-citizens-984824", "title": "14 Hollywood Stars Who Immigrated to the U.S. and Became Citizens", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Many actors and musicians who came to America from other countries are voicing their concerns over President Trump's latest travel ban.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/14-hollywood-stars-who-immigrated-us-became-citizens-984824", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "14 Hollywood Stars Who Immigrated to the U.S. and Became Citizens", "description": "Many actors and musicians who came to America from other countries are voicing their concerns over President Trump's latest travel ban.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/03/ans_split.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "14 Hollywood Stars Who Immigrated to the U.S. and Became Citizens", "description": "Many actors and musicians who came to America from other countries are voicing their concerns over President Trump's latest travel ban.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/14-hollywood-stars-who-immigrated-us-became-citizens-984824", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/ans_split.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "14 Hollywood Stars Who Immigrated to the U.S. and Became Citizens", "sailthru.description": "Many actors and musicians who came to America from other countries are voicing their concerns over President Trump's latest travel ban.", "sailthru.author": "Kara Haar", "sailthru.vertical": "Politics", "sailthru.date": "2017-03-20 07:30:00", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Television,Music,Culture,Politics,Arnold Schwarzenegger,Charlize Theron,Donald Trump,Nicki Minaj,Politics"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RM2HtvLSLs?ecver=2"], "publish_date": 1490009400.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
