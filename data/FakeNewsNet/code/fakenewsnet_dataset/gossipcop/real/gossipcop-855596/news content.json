We gotta show love while we're here.\"\n\nThen, Drake got a couple of things off his chest. \"Vanessa Hudgens, you look...incredible tonight.\" Now we all know what was going through the rapper's mind when the camera caught him staring at Hudgens during the opening monologue.\n\nNicki Minaj, however, wasn't happy with Drake's comment.\n\nNicki's reaction to Drake saying Vanessa Hudgens looked incredible pic.twitter.com/R30tHJnjid \u2014 CJ Fogler (@cjzero) May 22, 2017\n\nDrake admitted that he and Ludacris haven't always seen eye-to-eye, but he's still a big fan and loves him.
