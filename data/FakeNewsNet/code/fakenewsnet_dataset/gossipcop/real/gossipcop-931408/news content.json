From the very first time we spoke, we were on the same page. We love each other, respect each other and try not to sweat the small stuff. And we really make each other laugh,\" he said.\n\nThe couple met in 1998 in a comedy writing class at the Groundlings comedy school in Los Angeles and married in 2005. They now have two daughters together. The two co-starred together in \"Bridesmaids\" in 2011, and last year they announced that they will co-star in an upcoming pilot for CBS.\n\nClick through the slideshow below to see the craziest things celebs have said about marriage.\n\nCelebrities Say The Craziest Things About Marriage SEE GALLERY", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d28b6583b00003900dac405.jpeg?ops=424_244", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d4c9c2200008300d99388.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c04e4240000300094848d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2524bc24000051179350f4.png?cache=viET1XLEN4&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d261e983b00004d00dac064.jpeg?cache=DLFVLOLMkV&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d1b69472400003500faa350.jpeg?cache=9GpV6J60vM&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ceefc152500005500dbd234.jpeg?cache=uGSKDIrHrq&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d2740243b00004d00dac1bf.jpeg?cache=CGXTISAWUk&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d26503c240000ff349352ac.png?cache=JbKf5zIvlJ&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d275db82400009d1793540b.jpeg?cache=5yQWsxINH8&ops=424_244"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/melissa-mccarthy-husband_n_3499060", "title": "Melissa McCarthy, Husband Ben Falcone, Open Up About Their Blissful Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "keywords": "ben falcone Celebrities weddings melissa-mccarthy-bridesmaids celebrity marriage melissa mccarthy Marriage", "og": {"title": "Melissa McCarthy Opens Up About Her Blissful Marriage", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1910, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/melissa-mccarthy-husband_n_3499060", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"tag": "ben falcone Celebrities weddings melissa-mccarthy-bridesmaids celebrity marriage melissa mccarthy Marriage", "section": "Weddings", "published_time": "2013-06-25T22:45:01Z", "modified_time": "2013-06-25T22:45:01Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HPLifestyle", "title": "Melissa McCarthy Opens Up About Her Blissful Marriage", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1910_1000", "width": 1910, "height": 1000}}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b9d4c9ce4b03a1dcc866612", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "weddings"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1372200301.0, "source": "https://www.huffpost.com", "summary": ""}
