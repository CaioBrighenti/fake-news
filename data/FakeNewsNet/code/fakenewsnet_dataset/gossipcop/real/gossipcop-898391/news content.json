Tuesday, the black-ish star spoke out against the myriad of harassment allegations finally coming to light in Hollywood. \u201cWhile I\u2019m not totally surprised by these stories, it seems like quite a few men are,\u201d Ross said. \u201cTreating another human being with respect isn\u2019t complicated, but it seems a bit confusing for a lot of men out there, so I wrote a book. It\u2019s kind of like a children\u2019s book for men that is going to make it really simple and bring it back to the basics.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip above to hear Ross explain the basics of what men should not do to women in her book, \u201cThe Handsy Man.\u201d\n\nRoss is the latest celeb to step in for Jimmy Kimmel while he takes the week off to spend time with his family as his seven-month-old son recovers from a successful heart surgery performed Monday morning. Chris Pratt preceded her, while Neil Patrick Harris and Melissa McCarthy will appear Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.", "images":
