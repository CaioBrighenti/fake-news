Diaz, though, is probably totally fine with the decision. She and husband Benji Madden are utterly in love, and she has enough money from past films to live very comfortably for the rest of her life. Speaking of which, what is Cameron Diaz\u2019s net worth, anyway?\n\nThe actress has starred in so many amazing films that it\u2019s hard to keep track of them all, and her name is basically iconic at this point. So is it that shocking that she would consider retiring from Hollywood? According to her friend and one-time co-star Selma Blair, not really. In an interview from this weekend featured in Metro.com, Blair talked about the possibility of a sequel to The Sweetest Thing, saying,\n\n\"I would have liked to do a sequel but Cameron's retired from acting, she's like, 'I'm done.' I mean, she doesn't need any more films. She has a pretty great life. I don't know what it would take to bring her back.\"\n\nShe does seem to have a pretty great life, and while money isn\u2019t everything, it probably doesn\u2019t hurt. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Cameron Diaz\u2019s net worth is $140 million. Whew.\n\nThat number hasn\u2019t been confirmed by Diaz, but it certainly seems as though it could be accurate. Diaz has been in the spotlight for over two decades. She started modeling at age sixteen, and got her first acting role in The Mask in 1994, a movie that grossed $343.9 million in the worldwide box office. She also appeared in mega-hits like My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding, which grossed $299 million worldwide, and There\u2019s Something About Mary, which grossed $369 million and got her a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nThen there was Charlie\u2019s Angels, which grossed $264 million worldwide; Gangs of New York, which made $193 million worldwide; and the Shrek franchise, with Shrek 2 grossing $919 million worldwide. Back in the \u201990s, Diaz made $20 million from her role in Charlie\u2019s Angels, becoming the third actress to make that much from a film.\n\nIn 2010, Forbes named Diaz the second richest female celebrity of the year.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that Diaz has done more than just star in blockbuster movies. In 2013, she released The Body Book: The Law Of Hunger, the Science of Strength, and Other Ways To Love Your Amazing Body. In 2016, she wrote a second book called The Longevity Book: The Science of Aging, the Biology of Strength, and the Privilege of Time.\n\nPlus, Diaz is married to another celebrity: Benji Madden, the front man of Good Charlotte. Madden is reportedly worth $14 million, which isn\u2019t peanuts!\n\nAll in all, we\u2019re confident in saying Diaz is going to be just fine. Us, on the other hand? We\u2019re definitely going to miss her. She may have earned this early retirement, but Hollywood won\u2019t be the same without her.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12083149/gina-rodriguez-president-e1562945522927.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12121550/aziz-ansari.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/08/15061655/picture-of-priyanka-chopra-engagement-ring-photo-e1562606368750.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/03/12020428/Cameron-Diaz1-e1520870704355.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12195205/democraticdebate.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12092117/Friends-Pottery-Barn.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12070257/r-kelly-federal-charges-e1562940201720.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10114259/us-womens-national-team-e1562784596987.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02091156/Louis-Tomlinson.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02080120/aoc-border-patrol-facebook-e1562079691898.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072542/avatar-g-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/07/17235516/Sansa-e1541615562785.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11093957/camile-mendes-lucy-hale-new-e1562863206330.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27144916/police-car-e1561672307647.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/03112232/new-jersey-rape-case-e1562178162466.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/03101522/Emma-Portner-Justin-Bieber.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08101357/a-black-lady-sketch-show-e1562606101435.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11125306/kamala-harris-rape-kits-e1562874800780.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11071143/us-womens-soccer-espys-e1562854315128.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2016/06/09111010/bridesmaids-universal.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02092501/ama-abortion-laws-e1562084712895.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09071547/amy-mcgrath-e1562681757171.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/03/12020428/Cameron-Diaz1-e1520870704355.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Booth"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/cameron-diaz-net-worth/", "title": "What is Cameron Diaz's net worth?
