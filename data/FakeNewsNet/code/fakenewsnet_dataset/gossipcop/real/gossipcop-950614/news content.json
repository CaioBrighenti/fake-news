On Monday night\u2019s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the ABC host denied the president\u2019s South Carolina rally claim that \u201cno talent,\u201d \u201cterrible\u201d Kimmel had waited for Trump on Hollywood Boulevard, opened his car door and fawned over him like the sycophant of somebody\u2019s dreams when the then\u2013Celebrity Apprentice host visited his show. \u201cThat never happened,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing. We all know, even the people who like the president know he makes things up, but still, it\u2019s weird to hear him tell a lie that specifically involves you.\u201d\n\nKimmel denies seeing or talking to Trump at all before he took the late-night stage for his interview, but, if we\u2019re telling tales here, Kimmel has a real tall one about a bucket of chicken, Zach Braff, a single-occupancy bathroom, and the 45th president of the United States. It\u2019s also completely made up, but hey, that\u2019s apparently what we\u2019re all doing in 2018.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/19/GettyImages-960052182.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-crawl.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-hopper-david-harbour-stranger-things-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Dressing-Funny-Rachel-Dratch-Tina-Fey.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-r-kelly.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-stuber.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-arti-gollapudi.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-billie-eilish-song-of-the-week.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/big-brother-sunday.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-julio-torres.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-lil-wayne.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/15/15-r-kelly-criminal-record.w536.h536.jpg ", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/10/16/2-Sarah-Jessica-Parker.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/06/24/24-the-bachelorette.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/24/10-Kimmel-Trump-Rally.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-review.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-TomKennyMemes.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-wife.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Oliver-Jackson-Cohen.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Wet-Hot-American-MidSommar.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/24/10-Kimmel-Trump-Rally.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/jimmy-kimmel-denies-fawning-all-over-donald-trump.html", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Denies Fawning All Over Donald Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel Denies Fawning All Over Donald Trump Like the President Says He Did", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/jimmy-kimmel-denies-fawning-all-over-donald-trump.html", "description": "\u201cThat never happened.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/24/10-Kimmel-Trump-Rally.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel Denies Fawning All Over Donald Trump", "description": "\u201cThat never happened.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/24/10-Kimmel-Trump-Rally.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hallekiefer", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-10T02:23:54.625-04:00", "tag": "donald trump, jimmy kimmel, fake news, last night on late night, tv, jimmy kimmel live, comedy", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Jimmy Kimmel refutes Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Kimmel catered to him while Trump was a \u2018Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u2019 guest.", "sailthru.tags": "donald trump, jimmy kimmel, fake news, last night on late night, tv, jimmy kimmel live, comedy", "author": "Halle Kiefer", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531203834.625, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
