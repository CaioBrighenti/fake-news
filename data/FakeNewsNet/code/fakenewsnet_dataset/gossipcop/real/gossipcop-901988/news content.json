I know that they always say, \u2018There is no right time to have a child, you know. Just have babies,\u2019 \u201d Spears said.\n\n\u201cBut I think right now that it\u2019s maybe a little selfish for me to have a child. I am getting busy,\u201d she continued. \u201cI want to be able to do the same as what I have done with Maddie \u2014 really just be a mom for a little bit and have that time to focus on my next child.
