But on Thursday, Meghan confirmed that her dad would be unable to attend the wedding.\n\nThe news came after days of back-and-forth about his attendance at the wedding. On Monday, he said he would not attend in order to avoid embarrassing his daughter and the royal family after it was revealed that he staged photos with a paparazzi agency. Earlier on Tuesday, he said he had changed his mind and hoped to attend the wedding, and later backtracked his statement after he said his doctors told him he would need to have surgery that week.\n\nImage zoom Thomas Markle and Meghan Source: Meghan Markle/Instagram\n\nOn Thursday, Meghan released a statement confirming her father\u2019s absence at her nuptials.\n\n\u201cSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.
