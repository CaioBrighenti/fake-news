In August, an eagle-eyed Valkyrie viewer, amazed by the thickness on display, suggested that the actor was using some sort of movie magic. Was it a butt double? Or a prosthetic? VFX? A cushion? Screen Rant asked Cruise to clear up the bun debate, which he apparently had no idea about. \u201cThere was no prosthetic in Valkyrie. No,\u201d he confirmed. Cruise thought the question was funny, and further clarified that he does his own booty work in Doug Liman\u2019s American Made, in which he playfully moons his onscreen wife Sarah Wright. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Cruise told Screen Rant. \u201cIt\u2019s not CGI, it\u2019s me. I do my own mooning in films. So let it be known \u2014 I do my own mooning.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-new.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-crawl.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-hopper-david-harbour-stranger-things-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Dressing-Funny-Rachel-Dratch-Tina-Fey.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-r-kelly.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-stuber.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/27/27-tom-cruise.w330.h330.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-arti-gollapudi.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-billie-eilish-song-of-the-week.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/27/27-tom-cruise.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/big-brother-sunday.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-julio-torres.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-lil-wayne.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/15/15-r-kelly-criminal-record.w536.h536.jpg ", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-mindhunter.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-review.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-TomKennyMemes.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-wife.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-conan-sona.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Oliver-Jackson-Cohen.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Wet-Hot-American-MidSommar.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/27/27-tom-cruise.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/tom-cruise-valkyrie-american-made-butt-stuff.html", "title": "Tom Cruise Confirms His Big Valkyrie Butt Was Real, and It Was Spectacular", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Tom Cruise Confirms His Big Valkyrie Butt Was Real, and It was Spectacular", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/tom-cruise-valkyrie-american-made-butt-stuff.html", "description": "\u201cI do my own mooning in films.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/27/27-tom-cruise.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Tom Cruise Confirms His Big Valkyrie Butt Was Real", "description": "\u201cI do my own mooning in films.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/09/27/27-tom-cruise.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hunteryharris", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-27T17:01:43.089Z", "tag": "tom cruise, butts, booty shot, american made, valkyrie, movies", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Tom Cruise responds to the viral tweet asking if he used a prosthetic butt in \u201cValkyrie.\u201d", "sailthru.tags": "tom cruise, butts, booty shot, american made, valkyrie, movies", "author": "Hunter Harris", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506531703.089, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
