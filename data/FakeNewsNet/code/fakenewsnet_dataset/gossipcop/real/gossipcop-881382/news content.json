Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian opened up about the current state of their on-and-off relationship in a sneak peek for the Keeping Up With the Kardashians 10th Anniversary Special hosted by Ryan Seacrest and airing on Sunday, September 24. During the conversation, the self-proclaimed Lord didn\u2019t hold back about his feelings for Kardashian, with whom he shares kids Mason, 7, Penelope, 5, and Reign, 2.\n\n\u201cI just want everyone to know we are just coparenting,\u201d Disick said with a laugh. \u201cShe\u2019s, like, the only person I\u2019ve ever loved in my life. I still think she\u2019s cute and stuff.\u201d\n\nWhen Seacrest asked, \u201cDo you still hit on her?\u201d Disick joked, \u201cYeah I try to f\u2013k her like once a week.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Kardashian and Disick split in 2015 after he was spotted partying with ex Chloe Bartoli. In the interview airing on Sunday, Seacrest questioned if the two could ever see themselves reconciling. \u201cI feel like she has to say the door is closed, just to make the point,\u201d Kourtney\u2019s sister Kim Kardashian interjected, to which Kourtney added: \u201cBecause of the debauchery that\u2019s gone on. The debauchery that\u2019s gone on has definitely closed the door several, you know, billion times.\u201d\n\nDisick quipped: \u201cBut its been back open.\u201d\n\nKardashian moved on with model Younes Bendjima in December 2016 while Disick has been linked to Sofia Richie in recent weeks.\u201dKourtney thinks this fling with Sofia is a little weird, but nothing shocks her anymore,\u201d a source exclusively told Us Weekly. \u201cKourtney just wants Scott to be his old self. She shares three kids with him, so she\u2019ll always want the best for him and will always make sure he\u2019s happy.\u201d\u2018\n\nRichie\u2019s longtime friend Bartoli is less than thrilled about the news. \u201cAfter Sofia started hooking up with Scott, Chloe stopped speaking to her,\u201d a source told Us. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess. [They] were like sisters. They were the best of friends and were inseparable.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
