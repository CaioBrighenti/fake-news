To put that in perspective, that's higher than the tip of the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower. Though it's hard to believe anyone would let the singer do such a dangerous stunt, Banks said that no green screen or CGI effects were employed to capture the sweeping shots.\n\nThe video opens with Styles -- wearing a black trench coat and leather boots over a white sweater and dark jeans -- walking across a wind-swept field as the camera zooms in for close-ups on his face and hands. As the song's chorus kicks in, Styles takes off, hovering over a lake, then zooming through the tree tops. And, yes, at one point he appears to walk -- or run -- across water.\n\nCheck it out:\n\n\u201cSign of the Times\u201d is from the 23-year-old former One Direction singer\u2019s self-titled debut album, set for release May 12 on Columbia Records. The single debuted and peaked at No. 4 on the Hot 100. Styles\u2019 latest song, \u201cSweet Creature,\u201d hit No. 1 on the real time Billboard + Twitter Trending 140 chart shortly after its release on May 2. The song is expected to debut on the weekly Billboard + Twitter Top Tracks chart dated May 20 -- a chart where Styles has already hit No. 1 with his debut album\u2019s lead single \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d and No. 4 with the set\u2019s \u201cEver Since New York.\u201d\n\nWhen tickets for Styles' first solo world tour went on sale on Friday (May 5), they sold out in 29 markets in just seconds. The U.S. leg launches Sept. 19 at The Masonic in San Francisco and wraps Oct. 14 in Phoenix. From there, the singer will head to Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/01-Harry-Styles-sign-of-the-times-2017-screenshot-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/01-Harry-Styles-sign-of-the-times-2017-screenshot-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gil Kaufman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7785064/harry-styles-sign-of-the-times-video-flying", "title": "Watch Harry Styles Take Flight in Epic 'Sign of the Times' Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Watch Harry Styles Take Flight in 'Sign of the Times' Video", "description": "Harry Styles flies over the Scottish countryside in the video for \"Sign of the Times.\"", "og": {"title": "Watch Harry Styles Take Flight in Epic 'Sign of the Times' Video", "description": "Harry Styles flies over the Scottish countryside in the video for \"Sign of the Times.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/01-Harry-Styles-sign-of-the-times-2017-screenshot-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7785064/harry-styles-sign-of-the-times-video-flying", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7785064/harry-styles-sign-of-the-times-video-flying", "title": "Watch Harry Styles Take Flight in Epic 'Sign of the Times' Video", "description": "Harry Styles flies over the Scottish countryside in the video for \"Sign of the Times.\"", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/01-Harry-Styles-sign-of-the-times-2017-screenshot-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
