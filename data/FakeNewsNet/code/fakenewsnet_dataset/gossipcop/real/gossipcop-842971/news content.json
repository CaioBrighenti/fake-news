In the end, Rinna\u2019s comments got back to Kim and her sister Kyle Richards causing the drama between the three to explode.\n\nWhen Kim arrives at the reunion \u2013 she\u2019s not alone and has brought the stuffed bunny Rinna gave her for her newborn grandson.\n\n\u201cI brought the bunny,\u201d Kim reveals, \u201cbecause I never gave it to my grandson. Cause it didn\u2019t feel like it had good energy.\u201d\n\nThe moment shocks the entire RHOBH cast and looks on everybody\u2019s faces says it all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kim tells a teary-eyed Lisa. \u201cSo, I think what I should do is give it to you, and when you are in a better place, maybe you can give it back to me because right now I don\u2019t feel like it was given to me with the right energy.\u201d\n\nThroughout the exchange, Kyle nervously bites her nails as Rinna is stunned by Kim\u2019s words.\n\nEden then interjects asking Kim, \u201cWould you like one of my crystals? Maybe it\u2019ll help heal you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope, I\u2019m healed,\u201d Kim quickly shoots back. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Kim adds as the behind the scenes crew bursts out in laughter.\n\nKim\u2019s actions obviously have hurt Rinna as a tear falls from her face.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to cry over it,\u201d Kim tells Rinna.\n\nThen Lisa Vanderpump chimes in to try and show everyone the hope and positivity in Kim\u2019s words. Kim admits she could have regifted the bunny but instead gave it back to Rinna.\n\n\u201cRinna, she\u2019s still saying there\u2019s hope for the future between the two of you,\u201d LVP explains.\n\nHowever, Eileen Davidson sees it differently telling LVP, \u201cWhat do you think returning the bunny at the reunion means? Send it in the mail.\u201d\n\nTo wrap up, reunion host Andy Cohen asks a crying and hurt Rinna what she thinks of this.\n\nWatch the clip below to see the drama unfold and find out what Rinna has to say!\n\nI\u2019m calling one of the season 8 storylines now \u2013 Kim and Rinna reconcile, and Rinna gives Kim back the bunny. Kim, Rinna, and Eden\u2019s showdown at the reunion will be epic especially considering all they have to hash out.\n\nThoughts on the reunion preview? Can you believe Kim gave Rinna back the bunny? Do you think Kim and Rinna will reconcile eventually? Did Rinna\u2019s bunny gift have bad intentions/energy attached to it? Why do you think Eden feels Kim isn\u2019t healed?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.", "images": ["https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Teddi-Reunion-150x150.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/PaulinaMadrazo-150x150.jpeg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rhonj-150x150.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/lisa-rinna-teddi-mellencamp-rhobh-season-10-150x150.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-112x112.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Lisa-Rinna.jpg", "https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo-1.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rs_1024x759-170412061246-1024.rhobh-reunion.ch_.041217-990x734.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rhom-150x150.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KyleMauricioRHOBH.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rs_1024x759-170412061246-1024.rhobh-reunion.ch_.041217.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small-1.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/teddi-mellencamp-camille-grammer-season-9-rhobh-drama-150x150.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rs_1024x759-170412061246-1024.rhobh-reunion-2.ch_.041217-1024x759.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LVP-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rs_1024x759-170412061246-1024.rhobh-reunion.ch_.041217.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allabouttrh.com/2017/04/14/kim-richards-savage-awkward-exchange-lisa-rinna-part-2-rhobh-reunion/", "title": "Kim Richards Has A Savage and Awkward Exchange With Lisa Rinna During Part 2 Of The RHOBH Reunion! - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Richards Has A Savage and Awkward Exchange With Lisa Rinna During Part 2 Of The RHOBH Reunion! - The Real Housewives | News.
