We need you right now.\u2019 They kidnapped me for 24 hours!\u201d Vikander revealed.\n\nFassbender, 40, and Vikander tied the knot in a top-secret ceremony in Ibiza last fall. The duo exchanged vows at the luxurious La Granja farmstead resort surrounded by friends and family, sources previously told PEOPLE.\n\nImage zoom Alicia Vikander. Thomas Whiteside\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big romantic, and I always have been,\u201d the actress told Marie Claire.\n\nAlthough the actress has rarely discussed her romantic relationship with Fassbender, in the cover story to Vogue\u2019s March issue, Vikander opened up about how much she enjoys being married to the 40-year-old actor.\n\n\u201cI feel I\u2019m more happy and content than I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Vikander revealed to Vogue.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander Got Married in an Ultra-Private Ibiza Ceremony\n\nThe actress is currently busy promoting her new film Tomb Raider, a reboot of the video game character Angelina Jolie played in the early 2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that a character that has been seen as very sexualized back in the 90s is very different now,\u201d Vikander told Marie Claire.\n\n\u201cIf you go out in the street and ask men and women, young and old, what they find attractive, it\u2019s different,\u201d she added to Marie Claire. \u201cYou want her to be attractive and sexy, but, nowadays, you want this to be a girl that fights. Someone who\u2019s vulnerable, but funny. Someone who\u2019s OK with people seeing her bad sides.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Alicia Vikander. Thomas Whiteside\n\nVikander said it was also important to her that the action sequences seem believable. \u201cWe wanted to base most of the action in reality,\u201d she explained to Marie Claire.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a girl my size having to become a survivor and overcome a lot of obstacles, and I wanted it to be believable that she could do it,\u201d she added to Marie Claire. \u201cAll the action scenes when I had to fight with a man bigger than me \u2013 we had to figure out how I could actually kick his ass. I wanted to show young girls that it\u2019s cool to be a girl who\u2019s really strong.\u201d\n\nBecoming that physically strong role model took some effort. When she first signed on for Tomb Raider, she told PEOPLE she \u201ccouldn\u2019t do a pull up.\u201d\n\nShe added to PEOPLE, \u201cI\u2019ve met stunt women, and I thought about them and I was like, \u2018I want to have that strength too.\u2019 That was the aspect about this project that really attracted me. I wanted to and root for this young woman who goes through pain and struggles, but who\u2019s able to kind of step by step earn her development, and pulling out the warrior within her.\u201d",
