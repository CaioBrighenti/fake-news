When you become single, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, are you dating?!\u2019 \u201d she told PEOPLE at the WWE Evolution on Sunday. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m so not interested. I\u2019m just not ready yet.\u201d\n\nAnd while she\u2019s more at peace with the single life, she\u2019s still adjusting to her new normal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to heal, and I\u2019m not healed yet,\u201d she said.\n\nBut that certainly hasn\u2019t stopped her twin sister Brie from trying to nudge Nikki along.\n\n\u201cI did set her up on a blind date,\u201d she teased as Nikki shot her a look. \u201cYou\u2019ll see it on Total Bellas, but I got in a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Nikki and Brie Bella MediaPunch/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAfter ending their engagement in April just three weeks before their May 5 wedding date, PEOPLE confirmed in June that Nikki and Cena had reconciled. Sources previously told PEOPLE that her decision to call it quits was due to their differing stances on marriage and having kids.\n\nHowever, Total Bellas viewers saw Nikki break off her engagement to Cena for the second time. (They reconciled and broke up yet again off-camera, with Nikki telling PEOPLE exclusively, \u201cI had a beautiful and loving 6-year relationship with a wonderful man. I have the utmost respect for John, but I know this is what\u2019s best for me.\u201d)\n\nRELATED: Nikki Bella \u2018Not Even Thinking About Dating\u2019 Months After John Cena Split: \u2018It\u2019s Not a Priority\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen everyone was saying what I was going through was fake for ratings and all that,\u201d Bella previously told Cosmopolitian, \u201cand when you\u2019re really going through it, it\u2019s like, you\u2019re just, in my heartache you\u2019re literally just knifing it and just churning it.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Nikki Bella Officially Cancels Wedding to John Cena Again: \u2018I\u2019ve Ruined Everyone\u2019s Fairy Tale\u2019\n\nBella is now seeing a life coach and focusing on finding her own happiness outside of a relationship.\n\n\u201cI lost for so many years,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cThat was all my fault.
