The singers released their \"Youth\" video today (Nov. 5), and it's all about the power of young people.\n\nThe seven-minute video starts out with a ceramic gun crashing to the ground, followed by a series of footage from this year's March For Our Lives rally. Before the song begins, Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg delivers a line that sets up the rest of the impactful video in a poignant way: \"If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.\"\n\nIn between shots of Shawn and Khalid singing \"Youth,\" the video shows several kids and teenagers doing their craft, whether it's painting, wrestling, debating, playing piano or dancing ballet. It's an empowering way to give youth and their talents the spotlight, and proof that if you put your mind and passion into something, anything is possible -- no matter how old you are.\n\nThat powerful message plays into the need for younger generations to vote in the midterm elections, which is exactly why Khalid and Shawn released their video when they did. Both of them shared the video on Instagram, captioned with a line that sums everything up perfectly. \"Our youth is our strength, our vote is our voice.\"\n\nWatch the \"Youth\" video below.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8483246/shawn-mendes-khalid-video-youth", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Unveil Empowering 'Youth' Video Ahead Of Midterm Elections: Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid's Video For 'Youth': Watch", "description": "Shawn Mendes and Khalid released their \"Youth\" video today (Nov. 5), and it's all about the power of young people.", "og": {"title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Unveil Empowering 'Youth' Video Ahead Of Midterm Elections: Watch", "description": "Shawn Mendes and Khalid released their \"Youth\" video today (Nov. 5), and it's all about the power of young people.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8483246/shawn-mendes-khalid-video-youth", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8483246/shawn-mendes-khalid-video-youth", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Unveil Empowering 'Youth' Video Ahead Of Midterm Elections: Watch", "description": "Shawn Mendes and Khalid released their \"Youth\" video today (Nov. 5), and it's all about the power of young people.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
