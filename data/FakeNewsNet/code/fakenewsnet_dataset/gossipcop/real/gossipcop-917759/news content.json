He directed me in a play for public theater. He was very close to me and an inspiration to all of my peers,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople like Jeffrey Wright, Billy Crudup, Liev Schreiber, Mark Ruffalo, Josh Brolin \u2014 whoever was in my age range, Phil Hoffman was the guy.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cHe was a great director, he believed in theater. He vowed to do a play a year, which I\u2019m not sure he got to do, he was very busy doing movies. But he was a great inspiration and a great theater director. He was also a bit of a jock, he was a wrestler, he played basketball. He inspired me and I could go on for an hour about Phil Hoffman. He was a good friend and a huge, huge inspiration on me.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Philip Seymour Hoffman and Sam Rockwell Jimi Celeste/Patrick McMullan/Getty\n\nRockwell also told a funny story from his childhood about his dad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank the Academy, I never thought I\u2019d get to say those words,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was 8 years old i was called into the principal\u2019s office and my dad was there looking very solemn and said, \u2018We gotta go, it\u2019s grandma.\u2019 When we got in the car I asked what was wrong with grandma and he said, \u2018Nothing, we\u2019re going to the movies.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe actor then said that his love of movies came from his mom and dad and took a moment to thank his longtime girlfriend Leslie Bibb.\n\n\u201cYou light my fire, baby. I love you,\u201d Rockwell said.\n\nThis was Rockwell\u2019s first Oscar nomination for his work in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.
