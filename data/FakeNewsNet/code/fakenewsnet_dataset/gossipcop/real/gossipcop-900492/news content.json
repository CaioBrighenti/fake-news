Giving listeners an honest, inside look at Eminem\u2019s complicated struggle with parenthood, his daughter Hailie Jade \u2014 now a 21-year-old at Michigan State \u2014 takes the spotlight in three songs off the new album.\n\nHere are all the times Eminem references his daughter in Revival:\n\n\u201cCastle\u201d\n\nIn perhaps one the most heartrending songs on the album, Eminem dedicates \u201cCastle\u201d entirely to Hailie Jade. Written in the form of annual letters to his daughter, the rapper takes listeners inside his mind as a father.\n\nStarting with her birth, Eminem welcomes her to \u201cmom and dad\u2019s crazy world\u201d before rapping of the pressure he feels to provide Hailie with the life he was never given\u2014the castles of sand.\n\nImage zoom WENN\n\nAs Hallie gets older Eminem begins to feel guilty for making her the subject of many of his songs \u2014 even though they are a large part of the reason he\u2019s been able to provide for his family. He struggles with the idea that he might have exploited his own child for the sake of his career.\n\n\u201cI said your name but always tried to hide your face,\u201d he raps. \u201cThis game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you but damn. I never knew it\u2019d be like this. If I did, I wouldn\u2019t have done it. You ain\u2019t asked for none of this s\u2014. Now you\u2019re being punished? Things that should\u2019ve been private with me and your mother is public.\u201d\n\nLike in many of the songs on Revival, Eminem alludes to this being his final album.\n\n\u201cThey can take this fame back, I don\u2019t want it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll put out this last album then be done with it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Eminem\u2019s Daughter Hailie Is All Grown Up \u2013 and Stunning!\n\n\u201cArose\u201d\n\nIn this song, a drug-addicted Eminem issues his final apologies from his deathbed. The song starts with him wishing he could \u201crewind time like tape\u201d for every drug he\u2019s taken and the realization that he might not make it out of the hospital. From here, he starts his apology to his children.\n\n\u201cJust heard they\u2019re unplugging me,\u201d he raps. \u201cAnd it\u2019s your birthday. Jade I\u2019m missing your birthday. Baby girl, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he raps to Hailie Jade.\n\nImage zoom Source: Hailee Scott/Instagram\n\nHe raps his regrets about major milestones he will miss in his children\u2019s lives, including holidays, graduations and even weddings.\n\n\u201cSmile pretty for pictures. Always cherish each other. I\u2019ll always love ya. And I\u2019ll be in the back of your memory. And I know you\u2019ll never forget me. Just don\u2019t get sad when remembering.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s his family that helped Eminem pull through his addiction. \u201cConsider the last four minutes as the song I\u2019d have sent to my daughters if I\u2019d have made it to the hospital less than two hours later,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I fought it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Your Head\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cIn Your Head\u201d isn\u2019t entirely dedicated to his children, he once again apologizes to Hailie for making her \u201c80 percent of what I rapped about.\u201d\n\nEminem admits that at times he\u2019s struggled with how to deal with fame and his booming career.\n\n\u201cMaybe I shoulda, did a better job at separating Shady,\u201d he says.\n\nRevival is out now.", "images":
