She also visited Hilliard Elementary to distribute donations to families with young children in need.\n\n\"Today I was inspired by the huge hearts in Texas. There is a generosity of spirit that gets lost in political rhetoric, but-- people come together in a time of crisis. You know what's beautiful? Children look for light,\" Garner wrote alongside photos of her with her fans that she shared on the photo-sharing application.\n\nShe added, \"Terrifying things have happened to these kids in the past couple of weeks, but they don't want to dwell on those stories. They want to tell you that their neighbor's puppy was found. That they saved their mother's life by throwing her a rope when the flood water overcame her and now she's ok. That they all celebrated when power came back on. We have to protect our kids and we have to learn from them.\"\n\n\"Jennifer was there for a day visit with children and families benefiting from Save the Children's response,\" a representative for Save the Children told E! News.\n\n\"Our emergency response team has been on the ground in Texas since before the storm hit, working to meet children and families' immediate needs. We also established child-friendly spaces in evacuation shelters and have been distributing essential supplies to those impacted.\"", "images": ["https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1568414/jennifer-garner.jpg", "https://g.ibtimes.co.uk/www/img/home/ibtimes-logo-scroll.png"], "top_img": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1568414/jennifer-garner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jigmey Bhutia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/children-look-light-jennifer-garner-pens-heart-touching-message-after-hurricane-harvey-1638733", "title": "'Children look for light': Jennifer Garner pens a heart touching message after Hurricane Harvey", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Author": "Jigmey Bhutia", "news_keywords": "Celebrity,Jennifer Garner,Hurricane Harvey,Save the Children,Hurricane Harvey Texas,Jennifer Garner Children,Jennifer Garner Children Hurricane Harvey", "description": "'Today I was inspired by the huge hearts in Texas,' she said.", "article": {"author": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/reporters/jigmey-bhutia", "section": "Celebrity", "tag": "Save the Children", "published_time": "2017-09-10T06:43:10+01:00"}, "og": {"title": "'Children look for light': Jennifer Garner pens a heart touching message after Hurricane Harvey", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/children-look-light-jennifer-garner-pens-heart-touching-message-after-hurricane-harvey-1638733", "site_name": "International Business Times UK", "image": {"identifier": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1568414/jennifer-garner.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1568414/jennifer-garner.jpg"}, "description": "'Today I was inspired by the huge hearts in Texas,' she said."}, "fb": {"app_id": 133405490194030}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IBTimesUK", "creator": "@IBTimesUK", "title": "'Children look for light': Jennifer Garner pens a heart touching message after Hurricane Harvey", "description": "'Today I was inspired by the huge hearts in Texas,' she said.", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1568414/jennifer-garner.jpg"}, "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "robots": "index, follow", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,ibtimes.co.uk,newsweek.com,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk", "com.silverpop.cothost": "pod6.ibmmarketingcloud.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505022190.0, "source": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk", "summary": ""}
