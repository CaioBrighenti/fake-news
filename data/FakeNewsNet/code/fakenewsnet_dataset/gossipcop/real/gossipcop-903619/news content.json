I was stone cold sober so it just felt like a junior high party. Everyone else was having a great time.\u201d\n\nThe Superstore star and husband Ryan Piers Williams both confirmed they are expecting their first child in coordinating social media posts on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

They first met when Williams cast Ferrera in his student film while at the University of Southern California. They became engaged in June 2010 and married in 2011.\n\nAs for baby names, the couple has yet to decide but the mother-to-be knows that he or she will not be named \u201cafter a land mass or an idea\u201d like hers.\n\n\u201cI love my name now but growing up with the name America is not easy. I don\u2019t want to put that on my child because I know what that feels like so I\u2019m going to go with something that is more a name,\u201d Ferrera told Colbert.\n\nHer first late-night appearance not only comes after her pregnancy announcement, but it was also taped after she shared her Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants reunion photo in which her close friends and costars Blake Lively, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel cradled Ferrera\u2019s baby bump.\n\nSpeaking of the fictitious pair of traveling pants, Colbert asked the pregnant actress: \u201cWould the traveling pants fit you through all nine months of your pregnancy?\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: America Ferrera\u2019s Baby Bump Gets Some Love from Blake Lively, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel\n\nTo which Ferrera replied, \u201cDo you know what magic means Stephen? Yes they\u2019re magic, they would fit me all times.\u201d\n\nSuperstore returns January 4, at 8 p.m. on NBC.\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert airs weeknights (11:35 p.m. ET) on CBS.", "images":
