Kendall Jenner worries that her clothing line might get negative reviews in this Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nIn the clip, the 21-year-old supermodel finds out that Vogue wants to review her and her sister Kylie Jenner\u2019s fashion line, Kendall + Kylie. Kylie, 19, enters the room to find Kendall nervously flipping through the rack and asks what\u2019s going on.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to go over it. Make sure we like every little thing. If there\u2019s something we want to take out,\u201d Kendall said of the collection. \u201cF\u2013k! I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d\n\nThe former Vogue cover girl explains in a confessional that she doesn\u2019t want a bad review to ruin her credibility. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the line, but I\u2019ve worked really hard to be taken seriously and recognized in Vogue and in the fashion world,\u201d she admits. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t go as well as we hope, it might tarnish some things in the modeling world, so it\u2019s even more frightening.\u201d\n\nWhen Kylie asks if she\u2019s having second thoughts about releasing the line, Kendall says she\u2019s freaking out. \u201cEveryone wants an excuse to talk s\u2013t, and I don\u2019t want this to be that,\u201d Kendall says.\n\nThe lip kit maven reassures her older sister that everything will be fine. \u201cI think it\u2019s cute. I feel confident about it,\u201d Kylie says while tearing up. \u201cWe worked so hard on this. There\u2019s so many pieces, like, there\u2019s no way they\u2019re not going to love it.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E!
