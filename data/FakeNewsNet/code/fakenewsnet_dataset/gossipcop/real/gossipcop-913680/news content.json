But even in the world of the rich and famous, there are some people that take it to the next level.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re still looking for ideas on what to get your loved one, have no plans on Valentine\u2019s Day, or just want to daydream about receiving lavish gifts like the ones below, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the crazier presents in recent memory.\n\nAn entire private island\n\nJAY-Z allegedly bought Beyonc\u00e9 an entire island for her 29th birthday in 2010, with reports at the time claiming the rapper spent $20 million on the 12.5-acre piece of land off the coast of Florida.\n\nAs expensive as the gift was, it wasn\u2019t exactly a difficult purchase, as a quick Google search shows that several websites offer islands all over the world \u2014 albeit for a hefty price. So, if you\u2019ve ever dreamed of owning a floating piece of land, you\u2019re only a few mouse clicks away.\n\nEver heard about diversifying your bonds?\n\nThis past Christmas, Kanye West bequeathed Kim Kardashian West more than $200,000 in stocks from Apple, Netflix, and adidas. West could have easily purchased Kardashian something more materialistic, but instead, he looked to the future \u2014 not that we think the power couple will be running out of money anytime soon.\n\nNot only were the gifts unique, but it was a mature move. By showing his fans that thinking about and investing in your future is cool, Kanye may have inspired a few to quit wasting money on sneakers and clothes, and instead to invest in something that will make them money.\n\nRecord labels give gifts too\n\nLady Gaga\u2019s record label, Interscope Records, got the entertainer an all-white horse for Christmas two years ago. Gaga, who is obsessed with horses, seemed overjoyed at the gesture, promising to \u201clove her forever.\u201d Remember people: a horse is for life, not just for Christmas.\n\nA piece of artwork from Jeff Koons\n\nWhen you have friends in high places, as Rihanna most certainly does, you can expect the odd extravagant present. This Muhammad Ali book x dolphin Jeff Koons original piece was gifted to the singer by none other than her creative director/executive, Ciarra Pardo. We\u2019re not sure how much it cost exactly, but considering several of Jeff Koons\u2019 art pieces have sold for millions, we\u2019re betting it didn\u2019t come cheap.\n\nWhat the sculpture means \u2014 or is supposed to be \u2014 remains up for debate, but Rihanna seemed to think it was \u201cso sexy\u201d and probably found the perfect spot for it in her house.\n\nOffset\u2019s new Rolls Royce\n\nCardi B and Offset are the hottest couple in celebrity land, a fact that was cemented when the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d rapper bought her finac\u00e9e a brand new custom Rolls Royce for his 26th birthday. Offset returned the favor by having Cardi\u2019s name tattooed on his neck.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, she even got him a Wraith watch to match.

Jenner was out at the dealership when the pesky paparazzi photographed her, most likely in a bid to spoil the surprise. The reality TV star then had to lie to Tyga about her whereabouts to avoid ruining the gift. Judging by how happy and surprised he seems in the video above, it looks like her plan worked.\n\nIf getting a brand new luxury car right after you lose your other one for missing payments doesn\u2019t scream extravagance, we don\u2019t know what does.\n\nFlowers for days\n\nBack when Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were still a thing, there were reports that the \u201cBaby\u201d singer wanted to fill Gomez\u2019s house up with flowers. The florist he ended up hiring for this extravagant display of affection allegedly had to use every single flower in the shop to complete the order, delivering the flowers in multiple trucks.\n\nSo not only did Bieber buy every last flower in the shop, he had them delivered by the truckload \u2014 that\u2019s a power Valentine\u2019s Day move if there ever was one. Of course, the It-couple ended up breaking up later on, so we\u2019re not quite sure how effective the gesture ultimately was.\n\nCheesy AF\n\nImagine loving cheese and being gifted an entire cheese wheel to eat your pasta and risotto out of? That\u2019s exactly what John Legend got Chrissy Teigen for Christmas, fulfilling what she called a \u201clifelong dream.\u201d When you\u2019re as rich as these two, you don\u2019t worry about having enough plates, you worry about having enough cheese to mix into whatever pasta you\u2019re having that night.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re actually struggling for Valentine\u2019s Day gift ideas, check out our last minute gift guide here.\n\nSubscribe\n\nMain & Featured Image: ANGELA WEISS / AFP / Getty Images\n\nIn Post Image 1: Mike Coppola / Getty Images\n\nIn Post Image 2: Jason Merritt / Getty Images\n\nWords by Fabian Gorsler Footwear Staff Writer Bean-eating content machine!", "images": ["https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/C2-dWkLR8BTEcGJXdEQmR8uw5Xo=/fit-in/480x320/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/13170818/extravagant-celebrity-gifts-valentines-day-03.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/9Tm0zSS3M8R-bRkPlEIQLObKC_I=/fit-in/480x320/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/13165230/extravagant-celebrity-gifts-valentines-day-01.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/-QmECfMunrAiq7K1ROCFcdfvqDA=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15112105/valentines-day-2019-justin-hailey-bieber-00.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/Z8kSuGs305Y7ivO8nGJovsLH9SA=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/11141629/enter-rick-morty-contest-02.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/tYVnEvJ1HFGwiDDkrBxp1Soh4MQ=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/09104240/asap-rocky-arrest-timeline-00.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/czzABWzbgqF8TKvPGYI7cGeNIOw=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/12123159/valentine-day-guide-highsnobiety-11.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/GzZm3ij9OuimgPgnBRiG5PPHkXo=/fit-in/480x320/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/13170115/extravagant-celebrity-gifts-valentines-day-02.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/S7Cb3mF4ZHFEGqaJLqXsy0OVGM4=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12190152/viral-celebrity-twitter-moments-2018-feat.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/_fegAQ3n0K3uSI2HZLq2YXkfszI=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/09103552/adidas-originals-yeezy-boost-350-v3-first-look-00.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/1OfGaZNsJt3J8zph52xcNsvi6ss=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/13125243/celebrity-mothers-day-2019-00.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/ORfOLJlQG08C2NwDjV6GbvxaXIU=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/12122733/valentine-day-guide-highsnobiety-35.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/oik80StVFJapyC74N0cYrq4OgCY=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/09173205/tyga-01.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/Rv0QRa2bSD1KN1SjHXXZV3hfpNk=/fit-in/1000x600/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/13170035/extravagant-celebrity-gifts-valentines-day-00.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/D8NbY7N26UKHY9ARzjcGlLnnFDg=/320x320/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/22162513/fabian-gorsler-author-image-01.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/oIneujrbNfqWy2hhXmT8RcSMHQs=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/12123019/valentine-day-guide-highsnobiety-56.jpg", "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/_TywJxORFSh0i-A0rgftBAaD_CE=/120x72/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/11111818/young-thug-mac-miller-days-before-00.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/Rv0QRa2bSD1KN1SjHXXZV3hfpNk=/fit-in/1000x600/smart/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/13170035/extravagant-celebrity-gifts-valentines-day-00.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Fabian Gorsler", "Footwear Staff Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/extravagant-valentines-day-gifts-celebrities/", "title": "The Most Extravagant Celebrity Valentine's Gifts Ever", "meta_data": {"geolocation-detected": "US", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"widgets": {"autoload": "on", "link-color": "#155C99", "border-color": "#D6D6D6"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The most extravagant celebrity gifts as we get closer and closer to Valentines Day.
