Yesterday was his last day of work, and we\u2019ll make new episodes in 2018 without him,\u201d the streaming service said in a statement. \u201cYesterday was his last day of work, we\u2019ll make new episodes in 2018 without him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am obviously very disappointed in Netflix\u2019s decision to write my character off of The Ranch,\u201d Masterson said in a statement via his rep obtained by PEOPLE. \u201cFrom day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all. In the meantime, I want to express my gratitude to the cast and crew that I\u2019ve worked so closely with over the past three seasons. I wish them nothing but success. I am also so thankful to the fans that have supported me and continue to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter discussing with the producers, we've decided to write Danny Masterson off of The Ranch. Yesterday was his last day of work, and we'll make new episodes in 2018 without him. \u2014 Netflix US (@netflix) December 5, 2017\n\nImage zoom Danny Masterson Lalo Yasky/Getty\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Masterson, 41, will still appear in the second half of season 2, due Dec. 15, and could return for parts of the previously announced third season as the streaming giant writes him out of the Ashton Kutcher comedy.\n\nMasterson\u2019s departure comes amid mounting pressure over claims by four women who have accused the actor of sexual assault. The That \u201970s Show alum is currently under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County District Attorney. A rep for Masterson has previously denied the allegations of sexual assault.\n\nThe news of Masterson\u2019s firing comes one day after the Huffington Post reported that a Netflix executive unknowingly told one of Masterson\u2019s accusers on Sunday that higher-ups at the company don\u2019t think the allegations are credible. Netflix confirmed to the outlet that Andy Yeatman, its director of global kids content, made those \u201ccareless\u201d and \u201cuninformed\u201d comments, but noted that he was not initially aware that the woman he was speaking to had accused Masterson of rape.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lil-kim-andy-cohen.jpg",
