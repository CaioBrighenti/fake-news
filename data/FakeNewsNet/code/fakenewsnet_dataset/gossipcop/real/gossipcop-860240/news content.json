The actors have yet to confirm the birth of their second baby.\n\nHartnett and Egerton have been together since 2012 and welcomed a daughter in December 2015. The pair slyly confirmed they were expecting a second child while attending the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year, where the 28-year-old actress looked stunning in a black, body-hugging dress that showed off her growing baby bump.\n\n\n\nRELATED: Scott Porter and Wife Welcome Baby Girl -- See the Sweet Pics!\n\nDuring an appearance on Live With Kelly and Michael in April, the Penny Dreadful actor gushed about his baby girl.\n\n\"Your ego melts away when you have a new kid,\" said Hartnett. \"Your heart kind of leaves your body and you give it permission to walk around with someone else for a while. It's really terrifying but it's beautiful. I love it more than anything. I wish I would have started it earlier. But I'm so glad that she is the one I'm raising.\"\n\nFor more on the couple's first child, watch the video below\n\n\n\nET has reached out to the couple's reps for comment.\n\n\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1154906971.jpg?itok=sZoGPV7c&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-08/1280_josh_hartnett_tamsin_egerton_GettyImages-645807196.jpg?itok=_3R-Xdyd", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_josh_hartnett_tamsin_egerton_GettyImages-645807196.jpg?itok=CZyH9XOZ", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-06/gettyimages-958745538.jpg?itok=wlJ28kMj&h=87c7c3fc", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-12/paige_butcher_eddie_murphy_gettyimages-580965324_1280.jpg?itok=RYSujh-v&h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_josh_hartnett_tamsin_egerton_GettyImages-645807196.jpg?itok=CZyH9XOZ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/223853_josh_hartnett_and_tamsin_egerton_reportedly_welcome_baby_no_2", "title": "Josh Hartnett and Tamsin Egerton Reportedly Welcome Baby No. 2", "meta_data": {"title": "Josh Hartnett and Tamsin Egerton Reportedly Welcome Baby No. 2 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/223853_josh_hartnett_and_tamsin_egerton_reportedly_welcome_baby_no_2", "title": "Josh Hartnett and Tamsin Egerton Reportedly Welcome Baby No. 2", "description": "The couple has expanded their family by one!", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_josh_hartnett_tamsin_egerton_GettyImages-645807196.jpg?itok=CZyH9XOZ", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The couple has expanded their family by one!", "title": "Josh Hartnett and Tamsin Egerton Reportedly Welcome Baby No. 2", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Liz Calvario", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/223853_josh_hartnett_and_tamsin_egerton_reportedly_welcome_baby_no_2", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_josh_hartnett_tamsin_egerton_GettyImages-645807196.jpg?itok=CZyH9XOZ"}, "description": "The couple has expanded their family by one!", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Josh Hartnett", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Josh Hartnett"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
