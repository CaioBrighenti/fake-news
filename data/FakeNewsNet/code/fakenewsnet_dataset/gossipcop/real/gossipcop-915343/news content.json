{"url": "https://www.self.com/story/gina-rodriguez-february-2018", "text": "When I spoke to Gina Rodriguez on a recent Wednesday night, I was still pumped from attending a press screening of her latest movie, Annihilation , earlier that day (a fact that Rodriguez met with delighted laughter, admitting that even she hadn\u2019t seen it yet). I have very high standards for sci-fi and horror films\u2014I expect to startle and gasp and cover my eyes\u2014and this movie didn\u2019t just clear my very high bar; it vaulted over it. But to be honest, even if it had failed to register on my scare-o-meter, I would have loved it for what it is at its heart: in Rodriguez\u2019s words, \u201ca human story and\u2026bad bitches going into action.\u201d\n\nIn the film, which lands in theaters nationwide on Friday, February 23, Rodriguez plays Anya Thorensen, a paramedic who has volunteered to explore The Shimmer, a mystifying, dangerous, ever-expanding territory. Those who go into The Shimmer often don\u2019t return.\n\nVenturing into the force field alongside Anya are women toting guns, ammo, and advanced degrees in STEM: biologist Lena (Natalie Portman), physicist Josie (Tessa Thompson), geologist Cass (Tuva Novotny), and psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Together, they\u2019re determined to do what practically no one else has: enter The Shimmer, discover what it is, and return unscathed.\n\nThe role fit Rodriguez like Anya\u2019s well-worn fatigues. \u201cThe classic roles that are afforded to me\u2014 here, Gina, this is what you\u2019re capable of doing \u2014are usually roles I don\u2019t even relate to,\u201d she says, explaining that she identifies more with layered parts like the main character in Lady Bird than with parts inscribed by one-dimensional Latina stereotypes. Playing Anya? \u201cIt felt like butter.\u201d\n\nShare via Pinterest Nadya Wasylko. Wardrobe Styling by Shibon Kennedy. Makeup by Carissa Ferreri with Tracey Mattingly.

Leggings by Opening Ceremony.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s because the film could be a metaphor for her life for the last several years: Flanked by her own support squad, Rodriguez has marched headlong into a forbidding reality of chronic illness and come out stronger and bolder than ever. As she asserts her power in her personal life and her career, battling forces that, like The Shimmer, loom large and seemingly beyond her control, she is fighting not just for herself, but for other women in Hollywood and beyond, forging for them a path forward and up.\n\nRodriguez, 33, has Hashimoto\u2019s disease, an autoimmune condition that wages war on the thyroid gland , which produces hormones that influence how your body uses energy. Hashimoto\u2019s can lead to an underactive thyroid that doesn\u2019t produce enough of these hormones, and symptoms can be devastating and wide-ranging, including fatigue , joint pain, memory issues, and weight gain , to name a few.\n\n\u201cTo the core of my being, I know what it\u2019s like to feel like there is no way I can win this, so where do I even begin?\u201d\n\nAt first, Rodriguez says, Hashimoto\u2019s felt like \u201cthe curse of a lifetime,\u201d especially in an industry that places so much emphasis on size. The disease, though treatable, has no cure. For years after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 19 and Hashimoto\u2019s at 26, and putting on weight that wouldn\u2019t budge, Rodriguez preferred to deny what she was going through rather than focus her efforts on doing whatever she could to feel better. \u201cTo the core of my being, I know what it\u2019s like to feel like there is no way I can win this, so where do I even begin,\u201d she reflects.\n\nShe tried to rebel against what she knew her body needed by not taking her medicine on time, eating foods that she knew would make her feel terrible (looking at you, dairy), or deciding working out wasn\u2019t worth it if it wouldn\u2019t change her body. Eventually, she realized something had to give: \u201c[Hashimoto\u2019s] affects so many aspects of your life. I\u2019ve had it for so many years\u2026that rebellion of not taking care of myself can\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\nShare via Pinterest Nadya Wasylko. Wardrobe Styling by Shibon Kennedy.

Earrings by Jennifer Fisher.\n\nOver the years, she started taking her treatments seriously, changing her diet, and working out for health instead of weight loss. Though weight comes off naturally as a result of all her efforts combined, it\u2019s also complicated by what roles she\u2019s working on at a given time. To prepare for her intensely physical role in Annihilation , she weight trained and went vegan, so naturally, her body changed. When she spends 16-hour days on-set playing the titular character in the CW series Jane the Virgin \u2014a role for which she\u2019s determined not to lose weight \u2014she\u2019s at what she calls her \u201ccomfortable\u201d weight, which she can maintain without an intense workout regimen and diet changes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OK in both of those,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not less than because I\u2019m 10, 15, 20 pounds more.\u201d On the flip side, she knows it\u2019s not inherently better\u2014that she\u2019s not inherently better\u2014when she happens to weigh less, and that her handling of weight doesn\u2019t say anything about her other than that she\u2019s human.\n\nFive months ago, Rodriguez started working with \u201ca great new nutritionist,\u201d who identified a bunch of common foods that were getting in the way of her health. When she stays away from them, she says, \u201cso many of my ailments are gone. It feels like freedom. This is new. I'm 33. It's taken me a while.\"\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m on point, always on it, because, man, I\u2019m flawed.\u201d\n\nShe qualifies: \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m on point, always on it, because, man, I\u2019m flawed.\u201d A raft of most-craved foods rolls off her tongue with ease. \u201cI want the burger and the ice cream and the red velvet cupcakes. I want the croissant with my coffee, even though gluten doesn\u2019t do me justice .\u201d But it helps to remember it\u2019s all about baby steps, about making healthy living a daily , or even hourly, decision. \u201cWhen you say, just today, I\u2019m going to choose this because I know it\u2019s going to make me feel better, that\u2019s not such a crazy Mount Everest.\u201d\n\nHer boyfriend of one and a half years, Joe LoCicero, has been a cornerstone of the network of friends and family supporting her as she navigates the choppy waters of chronic illness. An actor and martial artist who practices Muay Thai (Thai boxing), LoCicero traveled to Thailand with Rodriguez in late 2016 so they could train in the sport together.\n\n\u201c[He] has really helped me have a healthier perspective on [weight], that stupid number that can destroy us and feel like it\u2019s equivalent to our self-worth,\u201d she says. \u201cThis love is so easy,\u201d she adds, describing her relationship with LoCicero as one of \u201crespect and kindness, and generosity, and compromise, and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nIt bothers her that another symptom of Hashimoto's\u2014memory troubles\u2014can make it seem like she doesn't always appreciate the little details that make their relationship so great. While she says that her forgetfulness hasn't interfered with memorizing lines, an important part of her job, \"I can't remember maybe a sweet thing my boyfriend has said to me a week ago. Or what we ate yesterday,\" she laments. \"It makes me feel shame. I don't want him to think that I'm not remembering our special moments together. And that stinks.\"\n\nRodriguez rose to fame in 2014 on Jane the Virgin (where she and LoCicero met). The show introduced enthusiastic swaths of America to the delicious drama of Latin American soap operas known as telenovelas. It has everything: murder, romance, and Jane\u2019s accidental artificial insemination as a virgin, to boot. After its first season, the series won a People\u2019s Choice Award and a Peabody, and Rodriguez took home a Golden Globe for best actress in a TV comedy or musical.\n\nShare via Pinterest Nadya Wasylko.

Bangle by Jennifer Fisher.\n\n\u201c Jane is just the greatest thing that ever happened to me,\u201d Rodriguez says. But she is quick to point out that she works her ass off to help it\u2014and herself\u2014succeed.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know my worth [at the start of my career] because the industry had such a specific perspective on what it should be as a brown woman,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cI had to start saying, \u2018Well, I know if I work hard, I can show my worth,\u2019 and I have been doing nothing but that.\u201d\n\nRodriguez, who studied film at NYU, recently directed her first episode of the show, now in its fourth season. She also started a production company, I Can And I Will Productions, through which she is developing multiple projects with CBS Studios that portray the Latino experience. Stepping behind the camera, she realized it wasn\u2019t some immutable force deciding what she was capable of and what she deserved. It was just other people. That knowledge primed her to advocate for herself. \u201cEspecially women, and especially women of color, really have to fight for equal pay,\u201d she says. \u201cMy white sisters definitely have a higher starting point, my black sisters as well. Latinos really do live in the lower end of pay .\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know my worth because the industry had such a specific perspective on what it should be as a brown woman. I had to start saying, \u2018Well, I know if I work hard, I can show my worth,\u2019 and I have been doing nothing but that.\u201d\n\nA vocal advocate of the Me Too and Time\u2019s Up movements, Rodriguez is harnessing her power to help fight for women not just in her industry, but in all of them. \u201cIt\u2019s empowering and encouraging and viscerally stimulating to be a part and lend the little voice I have to this giant cause of beautiful change towards a more fair world, a more fair environment,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take away from anyone or anything. It just makes everything easier and clearer and kinder and makes room for more possibility.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask about her biggest professional goals, she doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019m ready to do my movie,\u201d she says, meaning that she wants to direct a feature she\u2019s \u201cbeen mulling over for a while.\u201d \u201cWhether that means success or failure, I\u2019m ready to go for it.\u201d Other items on the list: producing more, along with creating more positions\u2014both in front of and behind the camera\u2014for women and Latino people, a cause she takes particularly seriously amidst today\u2019s political tensions.\n\n\u201cObviously I come from a very specific lens and a very specific perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cI of course would love to see Latino communities uplifted and celebrated in a positive light, because our administration loves to show us in such a negative light. That\u2019s going to be a part of my fight.\u201d\n\nShare via Pinterest Nadya Wasylko. Wardrobe Styling by Shibon Kennedy. Makeup by Carissa Ferreri with Tracey Mattingly.

At various times, she\u2019s pinned them on first-time-director nerves and the pressure to strike the right tone in her show, on stress and life changes, on \u201cbalancing reality with fiction, and reality with the bullshit of social media, the kind of psychological change that\u2019s happening in our climate, period.\u201d But she also realized she was taking too much thyroid medication, which was causing heart palpitations that spiraled into anxiety attacks. She lowered her dosage, and the attacks went away.\n\n\u201cIt is really important for us to be super self-aware,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t banking on that. I wasn\u2019t like, hey, yeah, let me get a disease that makes me have to be super aware. I don\u2019t want to be super aware of myself all of the time.\u201d\n\nAfter our call, I think about how Rodriguez describes Anya: \"She was that person, the one that pays the bills and gets shit done and fixes the car and fixes the leak.\u201d I think about bad bitches going into action, both on and off the screen. But most of all, I think about Rodriguez\u2019s reminder that every woman determined to make things happen\u2014herself and Anya included\u2014is really just a human, after all.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5bf3101f9bad4f734081d82c/4:3/h_130/woman-traveling-with-backpack-map.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b4cda7c41a5880bae10c1df/4:3/h_130/sophie-gray-selfies.png", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/4:3/w_728,c_limit/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/2:1/pass/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "https://collector-PX69t0oUvr.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX69t0oUvr", "https://media.self.com/photos/5c38c9effbe32b1b6bdddc1b/4:3/h_130/journaling.jpg", "https://www.self.com/images/self-starter-failsafe.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/2:1/pass/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zahra Barnes", "February"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/gina-rodriguez-february-2018", "title": "Gina Rodriguez on Hashimoto's, Equal Pay, and Learning to Fight For Herself", "meta_data": {"generator": "autopilot-build-Sat Jul 13 2019 12:06:11 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "Zahra Barnes", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond&#233; Nast 2019", "description": "Actor and director Gina Rodriguez is taking on Hollywood, and dealing with Hashimoto's disease.
