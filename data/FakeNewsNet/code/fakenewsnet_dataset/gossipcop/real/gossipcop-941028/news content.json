I love weddings, the kids love him. We love him,\" she said, speaking on behalf of her three kids, sons Kingston, Zuma and Apollo, who she shares with her ex-husband, Gavin Rossadale. \"Everybody loves [Blake]. He's lovable. I think about [marriage] all the time.\"\n\nShelton shared a similar sentiment with CMT's Cody Alan earlier this year.\n\n\"I think about [marrying her]. I don't think it's anytime soon or anything,\" he said. \"The more time that goes by, I guess, the closer you'd be getting to that.\"\n\nBack in March, a source told ET that while they are closer than ever, Shelton and Stefani definitely aren't rushing into marriage.\n\n\"There is no reason for them to rush into a marriage so they aren\u2019t,\" the source says. \"Both of them are happy and content with where their relationship is right now. They are on cloud nine for each other. They know they have found their true soulmate.\"\n\nFor more on the famous couple, watch the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Perform a No Doubt Song Together at ACM Awards After Party -- Watch!\n\nBlake Shelton Admits He 'Thinks About' Marrying Gwen Stefani\n\nInside Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani's ACM Awards Date Night\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-12/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-gettyimages-946794472.jpg?itok=POsxqFB4&h=95abe10d", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_041618_gwenblakeduetvidpic.png?itok=qV-NYPDK", "https://www.etonline.com/modules/contrib/ctd_uvp/img/placeholder.gif", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/ETO_TRENDING_CamilaShawn_071219vidpic2.png?itok=ORGgLcp8&h=59a3bc86", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-06/screen_shot_2018-06-03_at_11.34.40_am.png?itok=dQjtFZ6L", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-06/gettyimages-958745538.jpg?itok=wlJ28kMj&h=87c7c3fc"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_041618_gwenblakeduetvidpic.png?itok=qV-NYPDK", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tina Smithers Peckham"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/gwen-stefani-attends-wedding-with-blake-shelton-dances-to-hollaback-girl-at-reception-watch-103430", "title": "Gwen Stefani Attends Wedding with Blake Shelton, Dances to 'Hollaback Girl' at Reception: Watch!", "meta_data": {"title": "Gwen Stefani Attends Wedding with Blake Shelton, Dances to 'Hollaback Girl' at Reception: Watch! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/gwen-stefani-attends-wedding-with-blake-shelton-dances-to-hollaback-girl-at-reception-watch-103430", "title": "Gwen & Blake Attend Wedding: Pic", "description": "The pop superstar hit the dance floor on Saturday night when one of her tracks hit the speakers.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_041618_gwenblakeduetvidpic.png?itok=qV-NYPDK", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The pop superstar hit the dance floor on Saturday night when one of her tracks hit the speakers.", "title": "Gwen & Blake Attend Wedding: Pic", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Tina Smithers Peckham\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/gwen-stefani-attends-wedding-with-blake-shelton-dances-to-hollaback-girl-at-reception-watch-103430", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_041618_gwenblakeduetvidpic.png?itok=qV-NYPDK"}, "description": "The pop superstar hit the dance floor on Saturday night when one of her tracks hit the speakers.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Certified Country", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Certified Country"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
