The photo featured Underwood\u2019s gravesite, decorated with a baseball bat, blue flowers, daisies and a stuffed puppy.\n\n\u201cHappy Birthday Daddy Derek!\u201d Abraham, 25, wrote in the caption. \u201cWe all love you so much thank you for always watching over us.\u201d\n\nUnderwood died in a car accident on December 28, 2008, when Abraham was eight months pregnant. Although Abraham was estranged from him at the time of his death, she wrote in her book My Teenage Dream Ended that Underwood was \u201cmy first love, my only true love.\u201d\n\nSitting down with Bethenny Frankel on her show Bethenny in 2013, Abraham said she would have married Underwood had he not died.\n\n\u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t be where I am if I had that life,\u201d Abraham said.\n\nIn December, the mother of one posted a video on Instagram with her daughter on the eighth anniversary of Underwood\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIn loving memory of Daddy Derek 12/28/2008 we love and miss you and we wanted to share this video with others who lost a loved one around the holidays,\u201d she wrote in the caption.", "images":
