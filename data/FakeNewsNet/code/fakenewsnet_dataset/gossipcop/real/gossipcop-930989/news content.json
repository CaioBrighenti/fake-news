We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way to draw attention to those goals\u2014and in this case, it is unjust and off-target.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the rights of women to be empowered to make their own choices. Time\u2019s Up has neglected to speak with any of the women who welcome R. Kelly\u2019s support, and it has rushed to judgment without the facts. Soon it will become clear Mr. Kelly is the target of a greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him, his family and the women with whom he spends his time.\n\n\u201cKelly\u2019s music is a part of American and African-American culture that should never\u2014and will never\u2014be silenced. Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it. We will vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.\u201d\n\n\u2013Thanks for listening. R.
