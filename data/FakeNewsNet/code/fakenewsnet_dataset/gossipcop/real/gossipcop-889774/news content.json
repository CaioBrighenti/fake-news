Kelly Ripa visited Jimmy Fallon on Thursday, Oct. 26, and vented about her feisty 16-year-old daughter Lola Consuelos. The stories she shared are absolutely hilarious and totally relatable, especially one where Lola blew a fuse after Kelly posted a #TBT Halloween photo of her on Instagram.\n\n\"I'm never allowed to post a photo of her \u2014 ever,\" she said to Jimmy. \"I was like, 'You know what? She can't get mad at an eight-year-old photo. It's a Halloween throwback Thursday.'\" However, as soon as she heard her phone ring she instantly knew she made a mistake. \"I was debating [answering],\" she laughed. \"I was like, 'Maybe I shouldn't answer it\u2026 but what if it's an emergency?'\"\n\nLola Consuelos (right)\n\n\"She's like, 'You take it down right now! My friends follow you for some reason and they will see this!' I was like, 'You know what? I will take it down. I'll take it down for you.' And that was the end of the discussion,\" explained Kelly while Jimmy cracked up. However, we're sure Lola will be even more infuriated after the show, because Jimmy showed the photo in question! In it, Lola is just eight years old, and is dressed up like an adorable little firefighter. It's so cute! You can watch the interview, here.\n\nKelly also joked about how Lola begrudgingly admitted she likes Riverdale, which her dad Mark Consuelos appears in as Mr. Lodge, Veronica's dad. Kelly revealed that Lola doesn't seem to understand that what goes on in the show isn't real life. \"My daughter's like, 'Dad never lets me drink mimosas at breakfast!'\" Kelly quipped. \"And I go, 'Yeah, 'cause he's a real father and that's a character on TV!' She also joked that one of Jimmy's most famous characters reminds her of the teen.\"When I watch you do 'Ew!,' I believe you were hanging out with my daughter and her friends when you came up with this character,\" she said.", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lola-consuelos.png?w=1180#038;h=560&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kelly-ripa-lola-consuelos.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kelly-ripa-lola-consuelos.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-vanity-fair-oscar-party.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Hilaria-2-e1561303411835.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-13-at-10.37.44-AM-e1563028777937.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Mark-Kelly-2-e1561742338180.jpg?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kelly-ripa-lola-consuelos.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emy Lacroix", "Oct"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/kelly-ripa-lola-consuelos-tbt-halloween-photo-145426/", "title": "Kelly Ripa Says Lola Consuelos Freaked Over a Halloween #TBT Photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Teenagers will be teenagers, even if their parents are famous.
