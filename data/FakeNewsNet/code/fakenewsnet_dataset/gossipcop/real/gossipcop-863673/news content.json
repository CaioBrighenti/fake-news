News\u2019 Melanie Bromley in a two-part edited interview that aired Monday and Tuesday nights.\n\nThe two \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d cast members are at the center of a controversy regarding an alleged incident of misconduct on set in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Production on the ABC series\u2019s fourth season shut down earlier this month, according to a statement issued by Warner Bros. on June 11, and started up once more after an internal investigation found that a videotape \u201cdoes not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member,\u201d the studio announced June 20.\n\nDetails surrounding the incident, which allegedly took place in a pool between Jackson and Olympios on June 4, are murky. Though production has continued, E! News reports that Olympios\u2019s legal team will continue to investigate based on new witnesses. Olympios initially released a statement June 14 announcing that she had hired an attorney.\n\n\u201cAs I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life,\u201d the statement read, \u201cincluding hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.\u201d\n\nCareful not to blame Olympios specifically, Jackson said in the E! interview that he feels \u201cplayed\u201d by the entire situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure by who,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I got played.\u201d\n\nJackson walked Bromley through his account of the night in question. The two cast members chatted at the bar, he said, \u201ccomplimenting each other on being villains.\u201d (Olympios made it to last season\u2019s final four on \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d opposite Nick Viall, and was known for being aggressive to castmates. Jackson was recently eliminated on the current season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d after a woman appeared on set and claimed to be his girlfriend.)\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018We\u2019re about to dominate \u201cParadise,\u201d \u2018\u201d Jackson said. \u201cHomie stuff, like friends.\u201d\n\nAt that point, according to Jackson, Olympios suggested they head to the pool.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Hell yeah,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any single man \u2014 some married ones \u2014 wouldn\u2019t turn down Corinne. She\u2019s a beautiful woman.\u201d\n\nJackson said the situation seemed \u201ctoo perfect in a sense,\u201d and that he made sure cameras followed the pair to the pool.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because when you\u2019re a man \u2014 mostly African-American man \u2014 no matter where you\u2019re at, you always look for things that can help you out,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter calling Olympios \u201cthe aggressor,\u201d Jackson confirmed that the pair had oral sex, calling it \u201cprobably the wildest night of my life.\u201d He told Bromley that Olympios didn\u2019t seem too drunk to consent and that the two were friendly the next morning.\n\nProduction continued after that night, according to E! News, until an unnamed producer pulled Jackson aside three days later and told him to head home. Warner Bros. released its initial statement the following Sunday.\n\n\u201cI got a call by a producer that was just like, \u2018Hey, s\u2014\u2019s about to get real, real fast,\u2019\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI hang up my phone, and holy s\u2014. My group chat was on fire, like, \u2018What did you and Corinne do?\u2019\u201d\n\nThough the studio didn\u2019t reveal much in the statement, rumors began to fly. Accusations were flung at both Jackson and Olympios, he said, and conversations circled the possibility of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cNo man wants to be attached to that,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThat ruins you for life \u2026 That\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n\n(A Warner Bros. representative told The Post in an email on Wednesday afternoon that the studio had no details to confirm.)\n\nJackson said he senses a \u201cconspiracy,\u201d but others on set have been supportive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been humbling that you can meet people for three days \u2014 I knew them for less than 72 hours \u2014 and in that time frame, they went to bat for me and they spoke on my integrity and who I was as a man and what I did on set,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI went into this as the \u2018villain,\u2019 quote-unquote, and they got a chance to see the real me.\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UqopLwePG3b1tyC5ta9Vr-_Vy_I=/936x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OUZDU4NELE32LBP5U575BC7V4Y.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bj7yblClL0mgSRWclwKvsNCxRi0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OUZDU4NELE32LBP5U575BC7V4Y.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bj7yblClL0mgSRWclwKvsNCxRi0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OUZDU4NELE32LBP5U575BC7V4Y.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "June", "Sonia Rao Is A Pop Culture Reporter.
