She announced her engagement with a series of romantic photos and videos on her Instagram account, where her shinning rock was front and center.\n\nRenowned jeweler, Michael Greene, was the one in charge of designing the $2million sparkler. \u201cParis just called and told me how much she appreciates it. She says it\u2019s her dream diamond,\u201d the jeweler said in an interview. \u201cShe said she never thought Chris would come up with something so perfect. She\u2019s so happy and excited.\u201d\n\nGreene also revealed how great it was to work with Zylka on selecting the appropriate diamond for the former \u201cSimple Life\u201d star.\n\n\u201cI had never met Chris before, but he reached out to me. He came to see me in New York and said he had been thinking about this and wanting to do it. He wanted the ring to be perfect, exactly what she wanted. He had been asking around the family for tips and ideas,\u201d said Greene.\n\nZylka decided on a pear shape because it was similar to Hilton\u2019s mother\u2019s ring. Right after the engagement, Greene said \u201cParis at one point in time told Chris she really loved her mother\u2019s pear-shaped diamond, and when Chris came to me that was his request. The pear-shaped really jumped out for him and ultimately for her. He did some fishing, but in the end, it was all him. He\u2019s a smart guy, and hangs out a lot with the family, and I think she realized how much she liked her mom\u2019s ring.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, both Zylka and Hilton \u201cstarted shaking\u201d the first time they held the sparkler.\n\nGreene added, \u201cWhen he [Zylka] came to pick it up and opened up the box, he literally started shaking,\u201d and Paris told People, \u201cThe ring was so gorgeous and sparkling. I was shaking as I put it on. It is the most beautiful ring that I have ever seen!\u201d\n\nThe heiress added, \u201cI am so excited to be engaged to the love of my life and my best friend. I have never felt so happy, safe and loved. He is perfect for me in every way and showed me that fairytales really do exist!\u201d\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nIndulge Your Senses at the Most Romantic Restaurants in the World", "images":
