It was actually Princess Diana Princess Diana was way ahead of her game\u2026\n\nThe cycling shorts trend is a tricky one \u2013 and a topic that often arouses deep discussion. Some people feel they are best suited to a gruelling workout, others \u2013 like the Kardashians \u2013 think differently; donning the super-tight separates as part of their glam wardrobe. In fact, many fashionistas have hailed the world's biggest reality family as the pioneers for the trend \u2013 giving it a new, modern edge.
