In October 2016, she was held at gunpoint and bound and gagged by five burglars. The thieves stole two cellphones and approximately $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million dollar ring.\n\n\"I went back to Paris to witness Kanye's BFF, Virgil Abloh, make history with his first collection and runway show for Louis Vuitton during Mens Fashion Week,\" she wrote on her website. \"It was such an emotional trip!\"\n\n\"For me, it was the perfect time to come back to a place where I fell in love, but also a place where I suffered great trauma,\" she continued. \"The trip was actually only 12 hours because right after the show, we had to fly home for Teyana Taylor\u2019s listening party the same night!\"\n\n\"Emotionally, I feel calm. I've truly put the experience behind me, and have learned and grown from it. Because of this, mentally coming back to Paris wasn't difficult for me. It feels refreshing to face my fears and overcome them. For me, there's no point in staying in a fucked-up state of mind. 'Feel it, go through it and move on' has always been how I try to live my life. I would never suggest to anyone how to grieve, I can simply say what has worked for me.\"\n\n\"I'm so happy I went back,\" Kim said. \"It was the perfect experience coming back to a city I love so much.\"\n\nAt Abloh's runway show, Kim and Kanye were also joined by Kylie Jenner and Stormy's dad Travis Scott. Kanye and Abloh have been close friends for a long time, which was shown when the rapper broke down in proud tears, as he hugged Abloh after his show.\n\nAbloh, who was appointed as artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collections last March, is also the founder and CEO of Milan-based luxury brand Off-White. In other words, Abloh has many celebrity friends and fans, such as Bella Hadid, Rihanna, and Naomi Campbell, who were all also in attendance at the runway show.\n\nView Photos Instagram", "images": ["http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-404979h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/skeleton.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/06/22/kim-kardashian-paris-main-getty-1200x630.jpg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/19/newsletter-logo-v2-1.png", "https://ssl-cdn-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-fox-b-w.png", "http://warnerbros.112.2o7.net/b/ss/wbrostoofab/1/JS-1.5.1--NS/s1563036042?AQB=1&ce=UTF-8&ns=warnerbros&pageName=articles%3Aarticle%3A%3Akim-kardashian-reflects-on-paris-trauma-after-first-visit-since-robbery&c1=Toofab.us&v1=Toofab.us&c2=article&v2=article&c3=articles&v3=articles&events=event6&AQE=1", "https://ssl-cdn-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-thestir-logo-cut-v2-1.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/cdl-260x30-for-tmz3-1.png", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rsss-justjared-logo-cut-v2.gif", "https://ssl-cdn-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/cache/images/feedlogo2.v2014_05_09_134122.gif", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/05/24/tmz-tour-300x250-r01-1.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000013&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/elite-daily-logo-1.png", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/toofab-logo-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/06/22/kim-kardashian-paris-main-getty-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toofab Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://toofab.com/2018/06/22/kim-kardashian-reflects-on-paris-trauma-after-first-visit-since-robbery/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Reflects on Paris 'Trauma' After First Visit Since Robbery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"toofab": 116547240, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@toofab", "title": "Kim Kardashian Reflects on Paris 'Trauma' After First Visit Since Robbery", "description": "The trip was the first time the reality star had been back in Paris since the robbery in October 2016.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/06/22/kim-kardashian-paris-main-getty-1200x630.jpg"}, "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "description": "The trip was the first time the reality star had been back in Paris since the robbery in October 2016.", "robots": "index,follow", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://toofab.com/2018/06/22/kim-kardashian-reflects-on-paris-trauma-after-first-visit-since-robbery/", "site_name": "toofab", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Reflects on Paris 'Trauma' After First Visit Since Robbery", "description": "The trip was the first time the reality star had been back in Paris since the robbery in October 2016.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/06/22/kim-kardashian-paris-main-getty-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116046798441464, "pages": 324392354652}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TooFab"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529640000.0, "source": "http://toofab.com", "summary": ""}
