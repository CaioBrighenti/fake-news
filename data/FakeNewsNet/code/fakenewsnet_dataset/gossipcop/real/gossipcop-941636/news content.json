Since then, Amal Clooney has been spotted with her husband at the Cesar Awards in February and at the United Nations in March; she has been continuing her work as a human-rights lawyer, which she has done since the early 2000s.\n\nGeorge Clooney, who was one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors before marrying Amal in September 2014 at the age of 53, told People in February that his friends, whose children are all grown and in college, had taken to jokingly ribbing him about his late-in-life fatherhood. Despite the quips from his pals, Clooney was ready to take on the challenge.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s exciting,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re really happy and really excited, and it\u2019s going to be an adventure.
