For those who are out of the loop, there is a reason why Captain Marvel is in this costume.\n\nWhile it looks weird for some, it is actually not a deviation from the comics. Savvy comic book readers will recognize that the color scheme matches the old costume by the original Captain Marvel, aka Mar-Vell, before he switched it out for a red and blue one. According to reports, Carol Danvers herself donned a similar suit before she upgraded it to the most recognizable gear.", "images": ["https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/72529/brie-larson.png?w=760&h=431", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/77259/st-pauls-cathedral.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/74913/kanye-west.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/77674/sea.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/77688/ikea.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/77685/disability.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/40869/norwegian-christian-couple-marius-and-ruth-bodnariu-with-their-children.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/69409/wedding-rings-vows-marriage-commitment-husband-wife.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://christiantoday-29b4.kxcdn.com/assets/img/logo-footer.png", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/53624/jakarta-mosque.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://www.christiantoday.com/assets/img/logo.svg", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/40869/norwegian-christian-couple-marius-and-ruth-bodnariu-with-their-children.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/thumb/58206/christians-praying-for-fulani-victims.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/58206/christians-praying-for-fulani-victims.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&r=40", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/72529/brie-larson.png", "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/77695/st-pauls-cathedral.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=72&r=57"], "top_img": "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/72529/brie-larson.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.christiantoday.com/article/captain-marvel-spoilers-brie-larsons-costume-debuts-online-but-isnt-what-fans-expected/124752.htm", "title": "'Captain Marvel' spoilers: Brie Larson's costume debuts online but isn't what fans expected", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "captain marvel,Captain Marvel set photos,Captain Marvel spoilers,Captain Marvel news,Captain Marvel cast,Captain Marvel Brie Larson", "description": "Larson was photographed in her superhero costume recently, but it is not her iconic red, blue, and gold suit.
