Since the world can only handle so much suspense in being exposed to Pen\u00e9lope Cruz\u2019s bleach-blonde Donatella, we put together side-by-side comparisons of Versace\u2019s actors and their real-life counterparts to give you a taste of what\u2019s to come, as well as some historical information to appraise you on who\u2019s who. Knowledge is power, readers!\n\nDarren Criss as Andrew Cunanan\n\nPhoto: FX Networks/Getty\n\nCunanan, a gay gigolo with a genius-level IQ who lived his formative years in California, is known to have murdered at least five people throughout his 1997 killing spree, which began with his murder of an acquaintance in Minneapolis. Cunanan is believed to have suffered from antisocial personality disorder, which in turn made him \u201ccrave the limelight and aspire to the top, whether through charm or falsehood,\u201d according to Vanity Fair\u2019s Maureen Orth. Eight days after killing Versace, he committed suicide on a houseboat in Miami.\n\nEdgar Ram\u00edrez as Gianni Versace\n\nPhoto: FX Networks/Getty\n\nAt the time of his death, the Versace empire had amassed a reputation as one of the most innovative and popular fashion houses in the world, during which time Gianni also absorbed a devoted celebrity clientele. (\u201cA good designer must cultivate himself. Read, absorb everything,\u201d he once told Charlie Rose in an interview. \u201cTo be superficial, you have to be profound.\u201d) He was also open about his sexuality, becoming one of the first prominent celebrities to reveal he was gay in the \u201980s. He was 50 years old when murdered by Cunanan.\n\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz as Donatella Versace\n\nPhoto: FX Networks/Getty\n\nWhile Donatella is now known as the spunky HBIC and artistic director of Versace, things were different back in 1997. At the time of her brother\u2019s murder, she was running her own diffusion label of the brand, Versus Versace, which was created specifically for her by Gianni. Upon his death \u2014 which she did not witness \u2014 Donatella was given full creative control of the Versace brand, eventually guiding it through numerous iconic and memorable collections throughout her continuing tenure. She\u2019s rarely spoken about Gianni, though she spoke to the Guardian about him on the 20th anniversary of his death. \u201cWhen my brother was murdered, I had the eyes of the whole world on me and 99 percent of them thought I wasn\u2019t going to make it,\u201d she said in part. \u201cAnd maybe I thought the same, at first. My brother was the king, and my whole world had crashed around me.\u201d In the days following his murder, Donatella and most of the Versace family retreated to a private Caribbean resort due to safety concerns.\n\nRicky Martin as Antonio D\u2019Amico\n\nPhoto: FX Networks/Getty\n\nD\u2019Amico, an Italian model and fashion designer for Versace Sport, was Gianni\u2019s companion for 15 years. He was eating breakfast inside the Miami mansion when the murder occurred, later describing how he fell into a deep depressive state in the subsequent years. \u201cI had never been through a depression and never saw a therapist as I was advised to: why did I need to tell someone else what had happened when I knew I was this way because Gianni\u2019s death had torn me in two?\u201d he recently told the Guardian in a rare interview. \u201cI was in a nightmare, I felt nothing and gave no importance to anything \u2026 the house, the money \u2026 because it felt false to have expectations of life.\u201d D\u2019Amico has been living a \u201csimple\u201d life in the Italian countryside with his new long-term partner for several years now.\n\nMike Farrell as Lee Miglin\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nMiglin \u2014 a real-estate mogul based in Chicago, who rose from a poor background to achieve his success \u2014 was the third victim of Cunanan\u2019s murder spree prior to Versace\u2019s murder. The extremely gruesome May 1997 crime scene, which was widely covered at the time by the Chicago Tribune, was described as a murder \u201cthat would be considered vicious in any Chicago neighborhood, let alone the city\u2019s most expensive.\u201d The Miglin family has repeatedly denied that Lee, or anyone else in the extended family circle, ever had a personal connection to Cunanan.\n\nJudith Light as Marilyn Miglin\n\nPhoto: FX Networks/HSN\n\nA former dancer who built a beauty empire at the Home Shopping Network, Miglin was married to her husband, Lee, for nearly 40 years. She has rarely spoken about her husband in the years since his murder, with her only substantial interview appearing in the Chicago Tribune a year after Lee\u2019s death. \u201cI don\u2019t think you heal \u2014 you never close up that gaping wound \u2014 but you adjust,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI lived the life of a fairy princess and I had a prince for 38 years, and then one day my prince went to war and didn\u2019t come back.\u201d Miglin\u2019s products on HSN continue to be wildly popular.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/19/GettyImages-960052182.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-crawl.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/andrew-cunanan.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/06/23/13-noah.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-hopper-david-harbour-stranger-things-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Dressing-Funny-Rachel-Dratch-Tina-Fey.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/dontella-versace.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-r-kelly.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/antonio-d-amico.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-stuber.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-arti-gollapudi.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/dontella-versace.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-billie-eilish-song-of-the-week.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-julio-torres.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-lil-wayne.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/15/15-r-kelly-criminal-record.w536.h536.jpg ", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/marilyn-miglin.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/10/16/2-Sarah-Jessica-Parker.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/06/24/24-the-bachelorette.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-review.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/_lee-miglin.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-wife.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/edgar-ramirez-gianni-versace.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/dontella-versace.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Oliver-Jackson-Cohen.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Wet-Hot-American-MidSommar.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/06/23/13-cheddar.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/11/versace-show/dontella-versace.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/acs-gianni-versace-cast-real-life-counterparts.html", "title": "How ACS: Versace Actors Compare to Real-life Counterparts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "See How American Crime Story: Versace Actors Compare to Real-life Counterparts", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/acs-gianni-versace-cast-real-life-counterparts.html", "description": "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as Donatella Versace?
