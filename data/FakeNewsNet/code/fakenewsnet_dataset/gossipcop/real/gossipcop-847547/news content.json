When the model turned out on last night's Met Gala red carpet, she wore a glitter-flecked La Perla slip that seemed to be channeling Rihanna\u2019s infamous naked dress from the 2014 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund awards. Jenner, who also stars in the brand\u2019s latest lingerie campaign, opted to leave little to the imagination\u2014especially with the dress\u2019s open back, which revealed a major flash of a matching black thong to make a statement both coming and going.\n\nJenner\u2019s slip also featured a bold cut-out across the front, which showed off her toned midriff and felt true to the night\u2019s avant-garde theme. She extended the spangly statement to pointed pumps in the same finish. The choice of footwear felt like a more directional alternative to, say, last season\u2019s transparent shoe, a Jenner style signature. Too many accessories would have been overkill, and Jenner did well to eschew them in favor of barely there makeup and not much else besides a knowing smile. Consider it a lesson in how to do boudoir-inspired dress on the red carpet and beyond.\n\nSee all of the celebrity looks from the Met Gala 2017 red carpet:", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8ba018f9145cf6362b/16:9/pass/social-tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/10/2017-met-gala-article-banner-final.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8ba018f9145cf6362b/16:9/pass/social-tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Ward"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017-red-carpet-dress-la-perla-naked", "title": "Kendall Jenner Is the Best Un-Dressed Celebrity at the Met Gala", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017-red-carpet-dress-la-perla-naked", "title": "Kendall Jenner Is the Best Un-Dressed Celebrity at the Met Gala", "description": "Kendall Jenner wore a La Perla dress that left very little to the imagination at the 2017 Met Gala.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8ba018f9145cf6362b/16:9/pass/social-tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "Kendall Jenner Is the Best Un-Dressed Celebrity at the Met Gala - Vogue", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907cb8ba018f9145cf6362b/16:9/pass/social-tout-kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017.gif"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Kendall Jenner wore a La Perla dress that left very little to the imagination at the 2017 Met Gala."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-met-gala-2017-red-carpet-dress-la-perla-naked, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "description": "Kendall Jenner wore a La Perla dress that left very little to the imagination at the 2017 Met Gala.", "keywords": "Celebrity Style,Runway,Met Gala 2019,Red Carpet,Kendall Jenner,La Perla,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Celebrity Style,Runway,Met Gala 2019,Red Carpet,Kendall Jenner,La Perla,mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Fashion", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493724000.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
