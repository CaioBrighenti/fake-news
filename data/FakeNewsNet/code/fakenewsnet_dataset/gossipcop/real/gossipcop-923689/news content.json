The penthouse was last on the market for $14 million, so it wasn\u2019t too far from its ask.\n\nComedian Mike Myers\u2019s Soho penthouse has finally gone into contract three years after he first listed it on the market, 6sqft reports. Myers listed the over 4,000-square-foot Mercer Street pad on the market in 2015 for just under $17 million.\n\nMyers tried to sweeten the deal with an additional unit in the building, but that didn\u2019t take, and the penthouse has been trying to find a buyer ever since. The apartment was re-listed on the market for $3 million less last November, and that seems to have finally done the trick.\n\nIf it sells anywhere near its asking price, it will still be a lot more than the $8 million Myers shelled out in 2007 to purchase the pad. The duplex penthouse is located atop a seven-story building and has four bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms, and tons of outdoor space, including a couple of lovely rooftop terraces.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64715966/66315738_2368277796742543_902568994794373120_n__1_.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBzc92ehf0yv1IIH1ZluB3s2334=/0x86:1200x714/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10543835/292651452.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64717727/Screen_Shot_2019_07_12_at_11.52.56_AM.0.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54826807/161112_07_09_47_5DS_5892_Edit.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X97OabVHOSzDULvLkSsJ6-9ROQo=/0x0:1200x800/1200x800/filters:focal(280x80:920x720)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59188741/292651452.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64719054/171109_06_43_15_5DS_9875__1_.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64717148/CurbedComparisons_NYC_2.0.gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64715986/815726452.jpg.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBzc92ehf0yv1IIH1ZluB3s2334=/0x86:1200x714/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10543835/292651452.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mar"], "canonical_link": "https://ny.curbed.com/2018/3/28/17172604/mike-myers-soho-penthouse-contract", "title": "Mike Myers\u2019s Soho penthouse sells for $13.2M", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Curbed NY", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/curbedny", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/curbedny/?ref=hl", "published_time": "2018-03-28T13:00:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-28T13:00:05-04:00"}, "author": "Tanay Warerkar", "style-tools": "https://www.curbed.com/style/community/597/e6d6a5292af446399f703ed028ade35f/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "The duplex was on the market for nearly $14 million after originally asking $17 million in 2015.", "og": {"description": "The duplex was on the market for nearly $14 million after originally asking $17 million in 2015.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eBzc92ehf0yv1IIH1ZluB3s2334=/0x86:1200x714/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10543835/292651452.jpg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Curbed NY", "title": "Mike Myers\u2019s Soho penthouse sells for $13.2M", "type": "article", "url": "https://ny.curbed.com/2018/3/28/17172604/mike-myers-soho-penthouse-contract"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ny.curbed.com/2018/3/28/17172604/mike-myers-soho-penthouse-contract", "title": "Mike Myers\u2019s Soho penthouse sells for $13.2M", "description": "The duplex was on the market for nearly $14 million after originally asking $17 million in 2015.", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p41DMN5aXHoRmevvtE2EytYM59I=/0x100:1200x700/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10543835/292651452.jpg", "site": "CurbedNY"}, "sailthru.title": "Mike Myers\u2019s Soho penthouse sells for $13.2M", "sailthru.tags": "general,curbed-ny,front-page,celebrity-houses-real-estate", "sailthru.description": "The duplex was on the market for nearly $14 million after originally asking $17 million in 2015.", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-28 13:00:05", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4alhUTDnnmDnD4iSP-ejKsaAiY=/0x63:1200x738/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59188739/292651452.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F8wbm0Bh3jvqXK5ESoTyqFGIreo=/200x0:1000x800/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59188739/292651452.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6071835/144x144.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FF604A", "outbrainsection": "celebrity-houses-real-estate"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522209600.0, "source": "https://ny.curbed.com", "summary": ""}
