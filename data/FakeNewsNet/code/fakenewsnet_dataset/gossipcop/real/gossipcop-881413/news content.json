As the letter continued, Williams described the early physical likeness between her and her newborn.\n\n\"She has my arms and legs! My exact same strong, muscular, powerful, sensational arms and body,\" the athlete continues. \"I don't know how I would react if she has to go through what I've gone through since I was a 15 year old and even to this day.\"\n\nSerena Williams' Best Quotes on Motherhood\n\nAs the tone of the letter shifted, Williams recalled the times she was likened to a man because of her strong stature or false accusations that her performance on the court was the result of drugs. \"But mom, I'm not sure how you did not go off on every single reporter, person, announcer and quite frankly, hater, who was too ignorant to understand the power of a black woman,\" she wrote.\n\nTop Celeb Photos: 'Once Upon A Time In Hollywood' Photo Call\n\nThe empowering message continued, \"I am proud we were able to show them what some women look like.

I am trying, though, and God is not done with me yet. I have a LONG way to go, but thank you,\" she said. \"Thank you for being the role model I needed to endure all the hardships that I now regard as a challenges-ones that I enjoy. I hope to teach my baby Alexis Olympia the same, and have the same fortitude you have had.\"\n\nAs the tennis court champion concluded, \"Your youngest of five, Serena.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright E!
