He even wrote the word \"flawless\" across one of the photos of himself!\n\nMUST SEE: Check out the Cast of 'Meet the Parents' Then and Now!\n\nThough it's unclear whether or not the Goodfellas star will make an account on his phone, we'd really love to get an inside look at the iconic star's life offscreen!\n\nThis isn't the first time Robert has dabbled with social media. Earlier this year, he hilariously read mean tweets on an episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live. Turns out, he wasn't really happy with the criticism from the rolls on the platform, as he fired back at every single one with an insulting response.\n\nMUST SEE: 'Taxi Driver' Cast Reunites for The Film's 40th Anniversary!\n\nNow it makes sense why Robert keeps so private and doesn't have any personal social media accounts! We're still hoping that changes one day, though.\n\nClick through the gallery below to see the cast of Robert\u2019s hit film Meet the Fockers then and now!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/robert-de-niro-snapchat.jpg?w=1180#038;h=600&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Meg-Ryan-John-Mellencamp-married-Promo-02.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/robert-deniro-meet-the-fockers.jpg?resize=1000%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-vanity-fair-oscar-party.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/christie-brinkley-sailor-brinkley.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/robert-deniro-meet-the-fockers.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/goldie-hawn-kate-hudson.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ben-stiller-meet-the-fockers.jpg?fit=200%2C1"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/robert-deniro-meet-the-fockers.jpg?resize=1000%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Faragalli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/robert-de-niro-snapchat-131121/", "title": "Robert De Niro Finally Makes His Snapchat Debut \u2014 See His Selfies!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Welcome to Snapchat, Robert De Niro!
