The \u201cA\u201d tier is Winona Ryder (Joyce) and David Harbour (Jim Hopper); the \u201cB\u201d tier are the kids \u2014Finn Wolfhard (Mike), Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin), Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas) and Noah Schnapp (Will); the \u201cC\u201d tier is Natalia Dyer (Nancy), Charlie Heaton (Jonathan) and Joe Keery (Steve).\n\nBut what tier is breakout star Millie Bobby Brown in? It turns out she\u2019s in a league of her own, somewhere between tier \u201cA\u201d and tier \u201cB,\u201d making more than the other kids on set, but not as much as the more experienced adult actors, according to the The Hollywood Reporter. She reportedly negotiated her salary separate from the other child actors.\n\nBoth Habour and Ryder are now expected to make somewhere in the range of $300,000-$350,000 per episode. And the child stars of Stranger Things are also getting a sweet deal, reportedly being bumped up to as much as $150,000-$250,000 per episode.\n\nRegardless, all of the series regulars will be doing just fine \u2014 all of their salary increases are roughly 12 times what they were making prior to renegotiating their deals.\n\nThe salary negotiations come just weeks after a pay gap was leaked on another Netflix show \u2014 The Crown. The producers of The Crown said Matt Smith, who plays Prince Phillip, made more than Claire Foy, who portrayed Queen Elizabeth II in the first two seasons. While it is unclear how much more Smith made than Foy, producers have since apologized to both of them and vowed to pay the next queen more. (And in real life, Queen Elizabeth II makes much more than her husband, Prince Philip.)", "images": ["https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/stranger-things-pay-raise-millie-bobby-brown.jpg?quality=85", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1012_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/money-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1012_top2_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/stranger-things-pay-raise-millie-bobby-brown.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alix Langone"], "canonical_link": "http://money.com/money/5207358/stranger-things-cast-raises-millie-bobby-brown/", "title": "The Whole 'Stranger Things' Cast Just Got a Raise.
