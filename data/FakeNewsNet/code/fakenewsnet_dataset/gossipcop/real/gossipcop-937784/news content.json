The midi dress featured cap sleeves and an elegant side drape, making it the perfect mix of classic and contemporary. She finished off the statement outfit with a matching hat complete with net veil by Stephen Jones.\n\nJust days after the wedding Google searches for 'Amal Clooney Royal Wedding' had already racked up over 479,000 results. A sartorial success indeed!\n\nNow, finally, you can recreate the look, as the designer behind the show-stopping number, Stella McCartney, has released the design. The dress also stays true to McCartney's ethical principles and is made out of sustainable viscose, acetate and silk lining.\n\nThe 'Angie Dress', of course, comes with a luxury price tag and will set you back \u00a31,250.\n\nThe dress is also available on Matches Fashion, which has aptly renamed it the 'Amal tie-back crepe dress'. But it's selling out fast with only one size left in stock.\n\nIf you have a spring wedding fast approaching or are still in need of a lasting look to ring in the New Year, this dress is sure to be a winner.", "images": ["https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/19/11/amalclooney1912.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/19/11/amalclooney1912.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sabrina Carder"], "canonical_link": "https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/amal-clooney-dress-meghan-and-harry-royal-wedding-stella-mccartney-a4021401.html", "title": "Amal Clooney's stunning Stella McCartney royal wedding guest dress is now available to buy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc062b", "og": {"url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/amal-clooney-dress-meghan-and-harry-royal-wedding-stella-mccartney-a4021401.html", "title": "Amal Clooney's royal wedding guest dress is now available to buy", "description": "Until the moment\u00a0Meghan Markle walked down the aisle on her\u00a0wedding\u00a0day\u00a0all eyes had been\u00a0firmly on Amal\u00a0Clooney.", "updated_time": "2018-12-19T12:36:12+00:00", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/19/11/amalclooney1912.jpg", "site_name": "Evening Standard", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "fb": {"pages": 165348596842143, "app_id": 193840110715213, "admins": 36903991}, "description": "Until the moment\u00a0Meghan Markle walked down the aisle on her\u00a0wedding\u00a0day\u00a0all eyes had been\u00a0firmly on Amal\u00a0Clooney.", "keywords": "Amal Clooney, Royal Wedding, Fashion", "article": {"tag": "Amal Clooney", "published_time": "2018-12-19T12:34:00Z", "modified_time": "2018-12-19T12:36:12Z", "publisher": 165348596842143, "section": "Fashion", "subsection": "Lifestyle", "author_name": "Sabrina Carder", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 267, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 5, "external_link_count": 2}, "twitter": {"title": "Amal Clooney's royal wedding guest dress is now available to buy", "description": "Until the moment\u00a0Meghan Markle walked down the aisle on her\u00a0wedding\u00a0day\u00a0all eyes had been\u00a0firmly on Amal\u00a0Clooney.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@standardnews"}, "google-site-verification": "fI_fn7lv1QlqGWXMIJoqDICBG1ynAC0UDsrriO8e_m8", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Evening Standard"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545222840.0, "source": "https://www.standard.co.uk", "summary": ""}
