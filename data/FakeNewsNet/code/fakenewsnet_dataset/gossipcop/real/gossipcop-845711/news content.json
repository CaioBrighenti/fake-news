Charms in the shape of wishbones and four-leaf clovers that dangle from a slender chain are best sellers, as are a variety of items adorned with a large heart.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt2/12meyer-inyt2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Felder"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-09-12T08:47:40.000Z", "modified": "2017-09-12T08:47:40.000Z", "section": "Fashion", "tag": "Los Angeles (Calif)"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005368453, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/62c45c9a-e343-5a64-bc92-c95f95045fa6", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/80619c053bfe44da8de2abde5e1960a9", "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Rachel Felder", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Jewelry,Jennifer Meyer,Los Angeles", "pdate": 20170912, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019", "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "The designer Jennifer Meyer posing in some of her own jewelry creations at her Los Angeles home."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005368453"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "fashion", "CN": "jewelry", "CT": "spotlight", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005368453", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505188800.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
