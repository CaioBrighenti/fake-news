I would have fizzled away into the sunset,\" Stamos said.\n\nThe actor explained that, for a long time in his life, he thought that being a husband and a father was something he'd never get the chance to experience.\n\n\"I wanted it, but for some reason, I just thought I missed that boat or that I didn't do enough good in the world and it wasn't going to come to me,\" he explained. \"And I made a real decision to just really find someone that great\u2026 and I did, luckily. And we have a beautiful baby boy now.\"\n\n\"It's better than I ever imagined,\" he added.\n\nSoon after welcoming their son, Stamos' wife told ET that the couple were already thinking about having more kids \"ASAP.\" According to the Full House alum, McHugh wasn't exaggerating.\n\n\"Caitlin wants one tonight!\" Stamos joked. \" This chocolate is an aphrodisiac, so I'm going to try for twins.\"\n\nAll kidding aside, Stamos said he feels the same as his wife, sharing, \"It would be great to have more kids for sure.\"\n\nFor more on the happy couple's adorable family, check out the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJohn Stamos Says He Appreciates His Late Father 'Now More Than Ever' in Sweet Tribute\n\nJohn Stamos Gives Sweet Shoutout to Son Billy Before Reuniting With the Beach Boys for Capitol Fourth Concert\n\nJohn Stamos' 3-Month-Old Son is Already Dancing-- See The Cute Video!\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2019-01/kanye-kim-gettyimages-1077003424_0.jpg?itok=gWjC6hhE&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/modules/contrib/ctd_uvp/img/placeholder.gif", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/stamos.jpg?itok=KMRqCMQC", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x169/public/images/2018-04/et_intv_john_stamos_we_day_041819.jpg?itok=KuFerRE2&h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/stamos.jpg?itok=KMRqCMQC", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/john-stamos-says-being-a-tv-dad-gave-him-real-life-parenting-fears-exclusive-105745", "title": "John Stamos Says Being a TV Dad Gave Him Real-Life Parenting Fears (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"title": "John Stamos Says Being a TV Dad Gave Him Real-Life Parenting Fears (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/john-stamos-says-being-a-tv-dad-gave-him-real-life-parenting-fears-exclusive-105745", "title": "John Stamos Says Being a TV Dad Gave Him Real-Life Parenting Fears (Exclusive)", "description": "The new dad also opened up to ET about the best part of fatherhood and the possibility of having more kids in the future.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/stamos.jpg?itok=KMRqCMQC", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The new dad also opened up to ET about the best part of fatherhood and the possibility of having more kids in the future.", "title": "John Stamos Says Being a TV Dad Gave Him Real-Life Parenting Fears (Exclusive)", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Zach Seemayer\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/john-stamos-says-being-a-tv-dad-gave-him-real-life-parenting-fears-exclusive-105745", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/stamos.jpg?itok=KMRqCMQC"}, "description": "The new dad also opened up to ET about the best part of fatherhood and the possibility of having more kids in the future.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, John Stamos, Caitlin McHugh, Babies & Kids", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, John Stamos, Caitlin McHugh, Babies & Kids"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
