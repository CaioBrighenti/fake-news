The photo, in which McHugh stands underneath the bright sun, was taken on the couple's babymoon at the Miraval resort in Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\"Good morning baby of mine,\" McHugh wrote, captioning the photo apparently taken by Stamos.\n\nIf that's not the very definition of glowing, we don't know what is!\n\nThe \"Fuller House\" star got engaged to McHugh in October and later declared their intention to start a family, saying it would be \"a tragedy\" if they didn't have kids together.\n\nCould they be any cuter? Rachel Murray / Getty Images\n\nIn December, the couple shared the happy news that they were expecting a baby. Stamos explained to People magazine that McHugh became pregnant shortly before the pair were engaged. In fact, he revealed, the news prompted him to make their relationship engagement-official.\n\nThe exciting journey for the couple is enough to make us say, \"Have mercy!\"\n\nWe can only imagine the beautiful babe these two will make ... and the elaborate social media post they'll make to announce his or her birth.\n\nThe road to their \"Fuller House\" is a show we can't stop watching!", "images": ["https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1311950/john-stamos-caitlyn-mchugh-today-180120-tease-01_04f722873812651f17a55ea9ff979b9b.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1311950/john-stamos-caitlyn-mchugh-today-180120-tease-01_04f722873812651f17a55ea9ff979b9b.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/parents/john-stamos-fiancee-caitlin-mchugh-debuts-baby-bump-instagram-t121475", "title": "John Stamos' fiancee debuts baby bump on Instagram \u2014 see the pic", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/parents/john-stamos-fiancee-caitlin-mchugh-debuts-baby-bump-instagram-t121475", "title": "John Stamos' fiancee debuts baby bump on Instagram \u2014 see the pic", "description": "The gorgeous photo was taken during the couple's babymoon.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1311950/john-stamos-caitlyn-mchugh-today-180120-tease-01_04f722873812651f17a55ea9ff979b9b.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1311950/john-stamos-caitlyn-mchugh-today-180120-tease-01_04f722873812651f17a55ea9ff979b9b.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1311950/john-stamos-caitlyn-mchugh-today-180120-tease-01_04f722873812651f17a55ea9ff979b9b.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "John Stamos' fiancee debuts baby bump on Instagram \u2014 see the pic", "description": "The gorgeous photo was taken during the couple's babymoon.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "John Stamos' fiancee, Caitlin McHugh, shared a photo on Instagram of her baby bump, taken during their babymoon in Arizona.", "thumbnail": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1311950/john-stamos-caitlyn-mchugh-today-180120-tease-01_04f722873812651f17a55ea9ff979b9b.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516560809.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
