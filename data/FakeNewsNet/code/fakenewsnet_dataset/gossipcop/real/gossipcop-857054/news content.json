Hell yes. But how will we respond? With everything you think you took from us... love and joy and life.\"\n\n'Choose love' says Harry after Manchester\n\nHis tweets mark the first time he has spoken publicly since the night of the attack, when he said: \"Tonight, our hearts are broken.\"\n\nBraun, who also manages Justin Bieber and Carly Rae Jepsen, added: \"Words cannot express our sorrow for the victims and families harmed in this senseless act.\"\n\nGrande has cancelled the concerts she had scheduled over the next two weeks - including two dates London's O2 Arena on Thursday and Friday.\n\nScooter Braun's tweets:\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\n\"Tonight I got home and took my parents out to dinner. Korean BBQ. We drank and ate and laughed with the tables next to us. I experienced joy for the first time in days. And I remembered... we are free. We are all different but we are free to enjoy each other's company.\n\n\"I will honour those that are lost by living each day full. Full of fun, full of laughter, full of joy. I welcome the differences of my neighbour.\n\n\"The wish of terrorism is to take away that feeling of freedom and joy. No. That is my answer. No. We cant allow it. Fear cannot rule the day.\n\n\"More people die each year from car crashes then terrorism. Yet I will get in my car. I will choose to live than to be afraid.\n\n\"So... Manchester I stand with you. Jakarta I stand with you. Children of Syria I stand with you. We will honour you by not giving in to the darkness.\n\n\"And I will honour all of you by laughing loving and living. Living full for every wonderful innocent child whose life was taken to soon.\n\n\"So if you think you scared us, if you think your coward[ly] act made us change how we live... sorry. All you did was make us appreciate every day.\n\n\"With extraordinary evil we must fight with extraordinary greatness. Fight on. Goodnight world. Tomorrow I live full.\n\n\"I will honour all of u by laughing loving and living. Living full for every wonderful innocent child whose life was taken too soon.\n\n\"Am I angry? Hell yes. But how will we respond? With everything you think you took from us... love and joy and life.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
