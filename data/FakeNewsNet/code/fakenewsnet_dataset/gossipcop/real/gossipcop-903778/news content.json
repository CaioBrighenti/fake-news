Because\u2026the Animaniacs was just revived by Hulu with a *two-season order.* That\u2019s TWO FULL SEASONS, guaranteed.\n\nThis is one of those reboots we all secretly hoped for, but given that your average Animaniacs junkie is now, like, an adult with a mortgage and a car and a vague idea of how taxes work, we dared not speak it aloud. It\u2019s been 20 years \u2014 OMG \u2014 since Animaniacs ended its zany run on The WB. And we\u2019ve missed the show so much.\n\nHulu also got the library rights for Animaniacs, so luckily you\u2019re now able to stream all the old episodes to get back into it before the new seasons come out.\n\nUnder the same deal, Hulu also got the rights for Pinky and the Brain (and Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain.) So if you thought your nostalgia excitement quota was already met for the day, you were so wrong. This means Hulu offish has the entire Tiny Toons library available (!). If you were missing watching Saturday morning cartoons with your bowl of sugary cereal, you can totally recreate those days of yore yourself.\n\nThe new series will roll out sometime in 2020 as Hulu\u2019s first push into family-friendly original content.\n\nWe\u2019re sad we have to wait so long, but we\u2019re so excited to have one of our favorite cartoons back in action. Steven Spielberg is already attached to produce, too. So we know that Wakko, Yakko, and Dot are in more than capable hands.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/26131622/glow-e1530044218889.jpeg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/03161430/shows.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/28135359/michael-scott-e1530219265245.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/13112629/jimmy-kimmel-e1531506399286.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/26095121/sara-gilbert-e1530031916418.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/01193751/of.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/08/06122235/073018-becca-horoscope-lead-e1533584062450.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/04053920/animaniacs-revival-hulu-e1515106693445.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/10/08084159/Bobs-Burgers.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/09032622/getout-e1515526112937.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072542/avatar-g-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/25150120/shows3.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/10/02131819/danelle-dwts-e1538511544774.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/09024821/rose-e1515523709748.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/06102511/shows.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/05033102/marg-e1515180727233.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/06141237/carrie-satc.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/20111436/comic-con-e1532110490146.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/12/21035321/john-e1513886046541.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/09/07111301/reese-witherspoon-e1536344021796.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/25140721/friends.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/12222831/shows1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/04053920/animaniacs-revival-hulu-e1515106693445.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Thorne"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/animaniacs-hulu-revival/", "title": "Hulu is reviving \"Animaniacs,\" and we're having awesome Saturday morning flashbacks", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "animaniacs,animaniacs reboot,animaniacs revival,cartoons,hulu,steven spielberg,tiny toons,tv,tv shows", "news_keywords": "animaniacs,animaniacs reboot,animaniacs revival,cartoons,hulu,steven spielberg,tiny toons,tv,tv shows", "description": "Hulu is officially reviving \"Animaniacs\" with executive producer Steven Spielberg, and we're literally six years old right now.", "og": {"title": "Hulu is reviving \"Animaniacs,\" and we're having awesome Saturday morning flashbacks", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/animaniacs-hulu-revival/", "description": "Somebody bring us a bowl of Reese's Puffs and a Tang to wash it down with.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/04053920/animaniacs-revival-hulu-e1515106693445.jpg", "width": 563, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/animaniacs-hulu-revival/", "description": "Hulu is officially reviving \"Animaniacs\" with executive producer Steven Spielberg, and we're literally six years old right now.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/04053920/animaniacs-revival-hulu-e1515106693445.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/animaniacs-hulu-revival/", "title": "Hulu is reviving \"Animaniacs,\" and we're having awesome Saturday morning flashbacks", "description": "Somebody bring us a bowl of Reese's Puffs and a Tang to wash it down with.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/04053920/animaniacs-revival-hulu-e1515106693445.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
