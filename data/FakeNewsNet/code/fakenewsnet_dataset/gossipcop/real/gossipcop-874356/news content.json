News, rapper Meek Mill, took a plea bargain involving his arrest in New York City back in August when the police stopped him for \u201creckless endangerment.\u201d Meek Mill disobeyed traffic laws for the filming of a music video according to reports.\n\nToday, Wednesday, October 11th, the District Attorney\u2019s Office of Manhattan ruled that Robert Williams accepted an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, more commonly stated as an \u201cACD.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the rapper must complete thirty hours of community service. After Meek finishes all of the requirements, prosecutors will dismiss his case ultimately clearing his record. However, if authorities arrest Robert one more time in the following six months, the deal will be voided.\n\nThe NYPD confirmed to the publication that the 30-year-old rapper went into police custody after the authorities arrived at the 10th Avenue and Dyckman Street in New York City.\n\nCHANGE THE GAME! A post shared by Meek Mill (@meekmill) on Oct 9, 2017 at 10:17pm PDT\n\nAs you may know, Celebrity Insider reported that the rapper faced charges of reckless endangerment after authorities allegedly spotted the rapper dangerously driving around cars in traffic while doing wheelies or \u201ccatwalks.\u201d\n\nIn the video, the rap-star did not wear a helmet or obey traffic laws. Initially, police were not aware of the accused\u2019s identity, but they found the footage online which they used to indict the star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert\u2019s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, claimed if the rapper\u2019s name was \u201cJohn Smith\u201d police would not arrest him. He added that police could quickly go to the same street and witness others disobeying laws.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Angelina-Jolie-Brad-Pitt-Jennifer-Aniston-Friendship-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/meek-mill-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/meek-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maxresdefault-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Meek-Mill-SOHH.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/olivia-munn-1-300x218.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3-300x187.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Meek-Mill-XXL.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cassie-Ventura-Alex-Fine-Diddy-300x244.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Meek-Mill-XXL.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/meek-mill-accepts-plea-deal-involving-his-reckless-endangerment-arrest-75383/", "title": "Meek Mill Accepts Plea Deal Involving His Reckless Endangerment Arrest", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "meek mill,", "keywords": "celebrity news, meek mill,", "description": "In a report from E!
