She was brought in to audition with leading man Leonardo DiCaprio, but the audition didn't go quite as planned. Robbie later described the meetin with Harper's Bazaar UK (via People), saying, \"In my head I was like, 'You have literally 30 seconds left in this room and if you don't do something impressive, nothing will ever come of it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance, just take it'\u2026And so I start screaming at him [Leo] and he's yelling back at me.\" The scene was an intense fight between husband and wife.\n\nShe continued, \"So I walk up really close to his face and then I'm like, Maybe I should kiss him. When else am I ever going to get a chance to kiss Leo DiCaprio, ever? But another part of my brain clicks and I just go, 'Whack!' I hit him in the face \u2026 And that's not in the script at all. The room just went dead silent and I froze.\" But it seems the slap was what ended up getting Robbie the role. She stayed in character, and it paid off.\n\nRobbie originally wasn't the biggest fan of her role, but she eventually embraced just how fierce her character, Naomi Lapaglia, really was. Speaking with Elle, the 23-year-old at the time said, \"By the time we got to shooting, I loved her. She's a bada** who's making lemonade \u2014 with no f**king lemons.\"", "images": ["https://img1.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/-1502481527.jpg", "https://img2.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/she-knew-what-she-wanted-from-a-young-age-1502481527.jpg", "https://img.thelist.com/img/thelist_logo_black_2.svg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://img.thelist.com/img/thelist_icon_black.svg"], "top_img": "https://img1.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/-1502481527.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary Madormo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thelist.com/55191/stunning-transformation-margot-robbie/", "title": "The stunning transformation of Margot Robbie", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "//img1.thelist.com/img/gallery/the-stunning-transformation-of-margot-robbie/-1502481527.jpg", "title": "The stunning transformation of Margot Robbie", "description": "Actress Margot Robbie isn't just a pretty face \u2014 she's seriously talented and she's had an interesting life.
