{"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/style-rules-for-dressing-your-age", "text": "In my late twenties I made an idle life plan. I say plan, but it was more of an un-plan. Get the hell over fashion by 40, was its gist. Forty seemed monumentally ancient and \u2013 happily \u2013 a zillion years into the future. No way would I be hobbling to fashion shows aged 41 (I had a very bleak impression of the ageing process back then). Public displays of undignified excitement about the new must-have, aged 45? God forbid.\n\nWhat was I thinking? I\u2019m now at the stage where 40 looks immature, and, I can tell you, that tingle you feel when you get your hands on \u2013 or your feet in \u2013 a transformative piece of kit\u2026 it never leaves you. This can only be one of life\u2019s positives. Given that no one is exempt from having to get dressed most days, I \u2013 we \u2013 might as well do it to the best of our abilities, whatever our DOB.\n\nBeing well-dressed is a discipline. It\u2019s a talent. It\u2019s a lifelong learning curve\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing well-dressed is a discipline. It\u2019s a talent. It\u2019s a lifelong learning curve \u2013 and it can\u2019t be done without an injection of fashion. And yes, I do know that \u201ca uniform\u201d is the holy grail of modern style. It says you know who you are, what you want to project, and that you\u2019ve managed to reduce it all to a single navy/latex/whatever exclamation mark. But uniforms can adapt: see Kate Moss, Stella Tennant, Emmanuelle Alt, Miuccia Prada, Caroline de Maigret, and In\u00e8s de la Fressange, who all constantly recalibrate their stylistic affiliations while staying true to their essence. Static style, on the other hand, is the sartorial equivalent of having your face Botoxed and filled until it\u2019s an unmovable mask of fear.\n\nGetty Images\n\nRead next Styling Tips To Note From Lucinda Chambers type-gallery Styling Tips To Note From Lucinda Chambers\n\nI put this theory recently to Carolina Herrera, one of the most stylish 77-year-olds I know, and someone who appears to have alighted on her uniform of white shirts, whooshy skirts and tailored trousers when she was 12, but in fact still loves to experiment, albeit within a tight framework of self-knowledge. She may even be 78 or 79 \u2013 she\u2019s a bit hazy on this particular detail, although she\u2019s razor-sharp on why eye-catching sleeves are so important, and it\u2019s to do with framing the face. \u201cOf courrrrrse, I still loof fashion,\u201d she purred, before telling me about her latest haul from H&M. \u201cMaybe not all fashion. But really, what is fashion if not change, newness and experiment? It keeps you youthful.\u201d\n\nKate Moss's Most Memorable Style Moments type-gallery Kate Moss's Most Memorable Style Moments + 316\n\n+ 315\n\n+ 314\n\n+ 313\n\n+ 312\n\n+ 311\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Ruth Chapman, the languidly elegant fiftysomething co-founder of Matchesfashion.com, fashion is a means of feeling relevant, in the same way that art, films or books are. \u201cI\u2019m not rebellious the way I was in my twenties, and sometimes I just want to wear my old favourite things, but being relevant informs my choices.\u201d\n\nFashion is a means of feeling relevant, in the same way that art, films or books are\n\nSo if ever you find yourself trying on a rail of Valentino, Gucci or Erdem \u2013 or indeed H&M \u2013 and the tingle\u2019s not there, seek help, because if there\u2019s another lesson I\u2019ve learnt after a lifetime of loving clothes, and half a lifetime of making a living out of loving clothes (yep, still covering the shows, no sign of hobbling), it\u2019s that as the decades unfurl, we need those little shots of self-affirming gorgeousness more than ever.\n\nRead next Mango Celebrates The \u201cYou\u201d In Unique type-gallery Mango Celebrates The \u201cYou\u201d In Unique\n\n\u201cI like a boyish uniform,\u201d says Bella Freud (astonishingly youthful at 56), \u201cbut adding some new elements so I keep interested in what I\u2019m wearing is vital.\u201d In that sense, having her own brand to live up to, while occasionally a pressure, has its pluses. \u201cIt definitely keeps me from becoming a total slob,\u201d she muses. \u201cI get a lot of useful feedback, and it makes me think of other things I\u2019d like to wear that I haven\u2019t designed yet. Wearing my own stuff helps me not hide.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetty Images\n\nHiding \u2013 the reflex of the middle-aged. Stop it. And muddle \u2013 the natural habitat of the young. I think I realised this when my daughter, now 21, and her friends were dressing in clothes they\u2019d bought by weight from Brick Lane Market. They looked beautiful \u2013 the girls, not the clothes. The clothes were heinous. But it didn\u2019t matter. When your muscles are firm with absolutely no effort on your part, your hair ebullient and your face a peachy map of optimism, you really don\u2019t need a jewel-encrusted tunic to cast a flattering, uplifty glow on your cheekbones or a Hood by Air parka to give you edge. Youth already does that job.\n\nAt that age, travelling the world (gap years seem to go on forever these days) is what occupies conversation \u2013 and maybe, eventually, getting a job. When they do get jobs, truth to tell, their clothes get a little bit conservative \u2013 nothing would persuade my 24-year-old to give culottes, flares, jumpsuits or big sleeves a whirl. They have bosses and (perceived) rules to conform to. And even if they haven\u2019t, they don\u2019t always know where to start. It\u2019s a jungle out there in Zara. I don\u2019t mean to imply that I\u2019m Edina to my daughter\u2019s Saffy. I hope we\u2019re both more sophisticated than those two. But whereas she\u2019s young enough to play it straight, I need to keep an open mind. Michelle Obama is the queen of this, with her love of colour, pattern and sparkly bits; that sense of playfulness is one reason she looks youthful. But her way isn\u2019t the only way: Sofia Coppola is more minimalist, Cate Blanchett more experimental, Tilda Swinton downright kamikaze \u2013 but they all know their core style while constantly nudging it forward.\n\nGetty Images\n\nRead next Truly Timeless type-gallery Truly Timeless\n\n\u201cSo much of fashion is wrapped up in the confidence of the wearer,\u201d agrees Amy Smilovic, founder and creative director of Tibi. \u201cI see this all the time in my office \u2013 really talented women in their twenties, and they\u2019re just so reserved about what they\u2019ll try, so concerned about others viewing them negatively, so self-conscious.\u201d\n\nSmilovic\u2019s own moment of reserve hit in her twenties, when she worked for American Express. \u201cThere was a senior executive who wore Armani exclusively, so I had about a year where I was buying only Armani, the lower line, and I really looked way too old for my age. I\u2019m much more fashionable now. Looking back, I could have done so much better if I\u2019d only known how.\u201d\n\nHow Brigitte Macron Is Redefining First Lady Dressing How Brigitte Macron Is Redefining First Lady Dressing\n\n\u201cKnowing how\u201d isn\u2019t easy. OK, it is if you\u2019re naturally stylish, but that\u2019s about 0.2 per cent of the population. Regardless of our age, the rest of us have to learn style. We have to practise putting outfits together. We need to keep repeating mantras such as, \u201cAlways remove one thing before you leave the house\u201d (if we\u2019re Coco Chanel acolytes), or, \u201cShovel on 17 more things\u201d (if we\u2019re more in the Anna Dello Russo camp). We must swot up on proportions (which aren\u2019t only an age thing, but also a body-type thing). We must apply ourselves to the study of details \u2013 unless, like Michael Kors, who told his mother all the bows on her wedding dress were making him ill, we know everything there is to know about details aged five.\n\nOh God, do we have to know about details? \u201cButtons,\u201d says Samantha Cameron, \u201cand nice zips, and a pop of just the right colour\u2026 That\u2019s the sort of thing that makes something eye-catching and just fashionable enough at every age. My constant search when I was in No 10 \u2013 and one of the catalysts for setting up my label Cefinn \u2013 was for affordable clothes that were classic but with enough fashion to be interesting, so that you could wear them to work, or to pick your kids up from school without embarrassing them, but also to meet your girlfriends.\u201d\n\nRead next Inside July 2013 Vogue type-gallery Inside July 2013 Vogue\n\nStyle File - Samantha Cameron type-gallery Style File - Samantha Cameron + 72\n\n+ 71\n\n+ 70\n\n+ 69\n\n+ 68\n\n+ 67\n\nDon\u2019t imagine it ends with buttons, zips and colour. \u201cThe right sleeve length, how the neckline on your sweater is cut, a glimpse of unadorned toned flesh, heels, which date faster than anything else you wear\u2026 It\u2019s these little details that can so easily cause an outfit to unravel,\u201d 42-year-old Carolyn Asome tells me. Asome is a fashion writer, consultant, shopper sans pareil and the woman I most often turn to for fashion advice, because she\u2019s always just spotted the precise item that will elevate your entire wardrobe for the season; she\u2019s brutally honest; and she doesn\u2019t suffer from any namby-pamby Anglo-Saxon shopping guilt \u2013 three qualities that are essential on life\u2019s great trek towards style nirvana.\n\nLet\u2019s deal with those traits in order. The right piece. This may not be something you\u2019d initially considered, on account of the age thing. Or the price thing. But by now you should have worked out that a good fashion investment isn\u2019t simply a question of cost per wear but of joy per wear, and also of having something bankable in your wardrobe for those unexpected big moments. Who\u2019s to say that a Balenciaga trench with the kind of outsize shoulders you never thought you\u2019d wear again isn\u2019t precisely the disrupter your otherwise beautifully ordered wardrobe is crying out for? By the way, that rule about never wearing something you remember from last time around? Twaddle, like so many other fashion rules.\n\nBy now you should have worked out that a good fashion investment isn\u2019t simply a question of cost per wear but of joy per wear\n\nNever stop experimenting, albeit within the constraints of knowing what works with your shape, personality and lifestyle. Not long ago, on my way into Prada for my 15th pair of navy trousers, I bumped into my other fashion sounding-board, Annabel Hodin, a personal stylist for high-flying businesswomen. Hodin led me instead to an ostrich-trimmed blush-pink dress \u2013 infinitely more electrifying and also strangely more useful than yet another reflex purchase of Things I Already Own.\n\nRead next Ageless Style type-gallery Ageless Style\n\nLesson one: while revealing too much flesh or clinging to the holy terrors of boho, rock chic, grunge and girlish fussiness are all no-nos for the sophisticated grown-up, beyond that it\u2019s an open field. The most surprising pieces can turn out to be the bedrock of your style. Mind you, those ostensibly simple items often turn out to be one or more of the following: fabulously cut, the best fabrics, slightly glossy, interestingly textured, impeccably fitting \u2013 and comfortable.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cI\u2019m staggered when I look back at how uncomfortable some of the clothes I wore were,\u201d says Victoria Beckham. \u201cBut I dressed to be a certain kind of sexy. Now that I\u2019m 43, my idea of sexy has evolved. I feel more confident because I feel fulfilled creatively. I don\u2019t feel I have to show it all off in a tight dress. Maybe that way of dressing was a reflection of how insecure I felt.\u201d\n\nVictoria Beckham: Style File type-gallery Victoria Beckham: Style File + 234\n\n+ 233\n\n+ 232\n\n+ 231\n\n+ 230\n\n+ 229\n\nIn order to reach these little markers of revelation, we need brutal honesty. Actually, scrap that. We need not-brutal honesty. Cutting yourself some slack in this department makes you a better rather than worse self-critic, because if you can stop beating yourself up even for five minutes, you can focus properly on the job in hand. To recap, this job is to work out what to draw a loving veil over and what to accentuate, even if it\u2019s just a high foot arch. In my twenties I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell a high arch from a dropped proscenium. This, my friends, is where age and experience give you a major advantage, because high arches are the acme of elegance. \u201cLook closely at the items in your wardrobe that people always compliment you on or that you really enjoy wearing,\u201d counsels Asome. \u201cWhat is it about it that really suits your body and your psychology? It isn\u2019t always obvious at first.\u201d\n\nRead next Ageless Chic Ageless Chic\n\nGetty Images\n\nToo right. If you can think outside the cookie-cutter ideals force-fed to us, you may find that the physical idiosyncrasies that drive you to distraction when you\u2019re young become the distinguishing hallmarks of your personal style. As Asome says, \u201cDon\u2019t stick to conventional rules but the ones that make you look your best.\u201d This point was fabulously illustrated the other day when I hooked up with Susan Foster, designer of fatally tempting jewellery. It was only tea in my office, but Foster swept in holding a vintage python clutch and wearing Gianvito Rossi brown suede boots, a cream satin Brunello Cucinelli camisole, (very) fitted jeans, diamonds (her own designs, naturally) and a Sahara-coloured vintage mink coat (I don\u2019t even like fur, but these creatures had sacrificed their lives in the Sixties, so I let it pass) that matched her creamy skin and vanilla-coloured hair. To be honest, though, it wasn\u2019t the details that were hopelessly distracting so much as the overall fabulousness. Foster is the perfect example of someone who\u2019s constructed a Venn diagram of her body shape (voluptuous) and fashion trends (ephemeral) and forged her Foster-look where the two overlap. \u201cI do have one inviolate rule,\u201d she says. \u201cQuality. I love soft, satiny feminine materials and silhouettes that flatter my body type. My wardrobe is anchored in decadent statement pieces that I know I\u2019ll still appreciate in 10 years. I work around those and build out from there. The bottom line \u2013 for me, it\u2019s about the glamour.\u201d\n\nStyle File - Michelle Obama type-gallery Style File - Michelle Obama + 136\n\n+ 135\n\n+ 134\n\n+ 133\n\n+ 132\n\n+ 131\n\nIdentifying a loose overarching theme that encapsulates what you wish to project, whether it\u2019s glamour, power or high drama, is an inspired idea because it creates an anchor \u2013 no one should be skittering all over the shop floor as they get older (it\u2019s OK when you\u2019re young and still figuring things out) \u2013 while allowing leeway for (calculated) risk-taking. Amy Smilovic is meticulous in her methodology. \u201cEvery season I build my wardrobe like a chain-link fence: each new purchase is meant to go on top of an existing base,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to feel new and modern without creating a total upheaval in your closet to get there. If you\u2019re rotating out your wardrobe every two years, then you really need to get a handle on what your core look is.\u201d\n\nInteriors Shopping With The Chapmans type-gallery Interiors Shopping With The Chapmans + 9\n\n+ 8\n\n+ 7\n\n+ 6\n\n+ 5\n\n+ 4\n\nThis brings us to the final crucial factor: how much does all this cost? None of the women here stints on clothes, but equally none appears to have a chronic spending problem. They may splurge more on individual pieces, but they\u2019re probably spending the same percentage of their income as they did in their twenties, even when they\u2019re as ruthlessly immaculate as Ruth Chapman. \u201cProbably 50 per cent of my wardrobe is over two years old,\u201d she says. \u201cI never hoard, though. I regularly cleanse as I can\u2019t bear to have too many options. If I haven\u2019t worn anything for six months, it gets chucked. Ditto bobbled cashmere.\n\nI often buy two of the same thing if I fall in love. Fashion is as much about how the clothes make you feel as how you look.\u201d Does she feel guilty about the churn? \u201cFashion\u2019s a huge love affair for me \u2013 but I sell things on so that they have a second life.\u201d Smilovic is more businesslike. \u201cI either calculate price per wear or whether I\u2019ll treasure it, regardless. Everyone can make snarky remarks about the price of Vetements jeans, but in terms of cost per wear I\u2019m down to about a dollar. The emotional side is also very important to me \u2013 I love beautiful things. Maybe I\u2019m not going to wear it much, but sometimes I have to have it. I have an amazing Loewe dress in my closet just begging to be worn, but I\u2019m perfectly happy admiring it for now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStyle File - Carolina Herrera type-gallery Style File - Carolina Herrera + 25\n\n+ 24\n\n+ 23\n\n+ 22\n\n+ 21\n\n+ 20\n\nSecond, third and fourth lessons? The art of fashion as you grow up is to master it, not the other way around, to let it help you project the person you want to be, to use it as a tool that fills you with confidence, and never to lose sight of what Alan Greenspan (not a fashionista, but a rare economist with a sparkling turn of phrase) would call its \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d. Or as Carolina Herrera puts it, \u201cI like it when fashion has some element of fantasy. Always leave room for fantasy. And try to do things with grace.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to Vogue here.", "images": ["https://vg-images.condecdn.net/image/JKQWngKeAMP/crop/200/square/f/vbeckham47_gl_30jun09_pa_b_2.jpg",
