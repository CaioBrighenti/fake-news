They didn\u2019t even cut anything. I just figured \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I figured.\u201d\n\nOf course, the New York City native has secured much more substantial roles since then. Shortly after his feature film debut in Jason Reitman\u2019s drama Men, Women & Children, he gained recognition for his supporting role in Greta Gerwig\u2019s Lady Bird, which was nominated for five Oscars, including Best Picture. Chalamet also acted in another 2018 Academy favorite, Call Me By Your Name, for which he received his first nomination.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Steve Carell and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet Talk About Reality of Addiction in Beautiful Boy Featurette\n\nMore recently, he took on the role of Nic Sheff in Beautiful Boy, which tells the story of a drug addict trying to reconnect with his father (Steve Carell) and overcome his addiction.\n\nChalamet also has a prominent role in Gerwig\u2019s highly anticipated Little Women remake. He will portray Laurie, whose love interest, Jo, is played by Saoirse Ronan. Other notable cast members include Emma Watson, Meryl Streep and Laura Dern.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/sonic-the-hedgehog-1.jpg?w=1024&h=584&crop=1",
