(Tyler Golden/NBC)\n\nAll celebrity coaches on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d brag about the potential of their contestants, and Blake Shelton was no different after his team member, 23-year-old Nashville rocker Chloe Kohanski, was crowned the winner of Season 13 this week.\n\nBut backstage with reporters after the show on Tuesday night, Shelton made a big claim: \u201cI truly think Chloe can go on from here and become really the first superstar,\u201d he said.\n\n[\u2018The Voice\u2019 finale: How Chloe Kohanski won despite a big mistake by Miley Cyrus]\n\nThen Shelton quickly walked back his pronouncement a bit, saying that Kohanski could be \u201cthe first star that we\u2019ve had come out of this show that can have some hit songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think you can be a superstar,\u201d he added, according to a transcript from Hollywood Life. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying not to hex this thing.\u201d\n\nShelton\u2019s hesitation makes sense. \u201cThe Voice\u201d winners have notably had some issues becoming real-life music stars once the show ends and their recording contracts kick in. Some winners, such as Cassadee Pope, Jordan Smith and Danielle Bradbery, launched successful singles and albums. Others, such as Alisan Porter and Craig Wayne Boyd, parted ways with the label without releasing a record.\n\nIn the past, Adam Levine has blamed the record labels. After a contestant wins, they\u2019re assigned to a label within Universal Music Group, and executives take it from there. Levine complained in an expletive-filled interview with Howard Stern that \u201cno one knows what they\u2019re doing\u201d on the label side, which is frustrating when the show and coaches boost them so much on national television.\n\nIn a recent HuffPost piece about the trajectory of \u201cVoice\u201d winners, executive producer Audrey Morrissey echoed the same idea, in a much gentler way.\n\n\u201cThere is choice amongst the label what they do with them, but we, as a television show, once they won, we\u2019re not necessarily personally involved in their careers,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cWe do everything in our power to prop them up, as we can, but that\u2019s when it flips over to, really, the music business.\u201d\n\nKohanski is leaving \u201cThe Voice\u201d with as much momentum as one could hope for, with a string of Top 10 iTunes singles from the show and a loyal fan base that connected to her unique, psychedelic rock-inspired sound. She also has Nashville superstar Shelton as a mentor and a fan: \u201cIt would change music if she could get on the radio,\u201d he said Tuesday. Although Shelton\u2019s country colleagues might not necessarily help with her psych rock dreams, he\u2019s still very well connected in the city where Kohanski lives \u2014 and, until her appearance on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d worked in a coffee shop as a struggling musician.\n\nNow we wait and see if Kohanski breaks \u201cThe Voice\u201d no-superstar curse. Either way, the show\u2019s ratings are stellar, as it still averages about 10 million viewers per episode. But with \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d coming back to ABC in March and threatening to steal some of the reality singing competition spotlight, it wouldn\u2019t hurt the show to earn some credibility and break a huge artist.\n\n\u201cThe record company just needs to give her the platform. If they can really do that it\u2019s going to be easy,\u201d Shelton said after the finale, according to USA Today. \u201cIf we can\u2019t follow through with this thing, then WTF?\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAdam Levine slams record labels for mismanaging \u2018The Voice\u2019 winners\n\nA former contestant from \u2018The Voice\u2019 spills how the singing show really operates\n\n\u2018The Voice\u2019 launched Danielle Bradbery\u2019s music career.
