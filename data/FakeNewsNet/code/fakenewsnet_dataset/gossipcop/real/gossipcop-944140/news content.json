J. (@ParisJackson) June 14, 2018\n\nParis added in response to another fan, \u201cI don\u2019t think it was intentionally targeted it at him. i think it was probably just some young kids f\u2014ing around. but to me a name is a name and i couldn\u2019t just hear about it and not go see it for myself.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Paris Jackson Explains Why She Left Dior Show: \u2018I Do Not Support Animals Being Branded & Whipped\u2019\n\nJune 25 marks the ninth anniversary since Michael\u2019s death from an apparent cardiac arrest at age 50.\n\nImage zoom Paris Jackson and Michael Jackson Getty (2)\n\nRELATED: Paris Jackson Claps Back at Family Members Claiming She\u2019s Out of Control\n\nParis remembered her father in a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, revealing that many who knew the singer say the two share many similarities.\n\n\u201cHe is my father,\u201d the model said. \u201cHe will always be my father. He never wasn\u2019t, and he never will not be. People that knew him really well say they see him in me, that it\u2019s almost scary.\u201d\n\nHer older brother, Prince Michael Jackson, agrees.\n\n\u201cBasically, as a person, she is who my dad is. The only thing that\u2019s different would be her age and her gender,\u201d he told the magazine, adding that Paris is like their dad \u201cin all of her strengths, and almost all of her weaknesses as well. She\u2019s very passionate. She is very emotional to the point where she can let emotion cloud her judgment.\u201d", "images":
