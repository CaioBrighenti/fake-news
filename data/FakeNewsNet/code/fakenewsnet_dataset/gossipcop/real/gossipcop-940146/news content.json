A staple of NBC's Thursday night 'Must See TV' lineup, Friends ran for 10 years before bidding fans farewell in 2004. It made the series' stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc household names and has spawned rumours of a spinoff ever since it went off the air.\n\nWith streaming services like Netflix now carrying the series and reruns airing on television, an entire new generation has been introduced to the hit show. Talks of a Friends reboot or revival have made headlines every year or so, but with so many other shows being reimagined for a contemporary audience (like Will and Grace, Murphy Brown and Roswell), fans are still hoping for a Friends revival at some point.\n\nUnfortunately for Friends fan, it doesn't look like that revival is ever going to happen. Crane was recently one of the panelists at TheWrap's Emmy Series comedy showrunners panel, when he put to rest any rumours of a Friends reboot happening.\n\n\u201cNever happening. Never. We did it! It\u2019s done\u201d, Crane definitely stated. While many were understandably upset about the revelation, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend star Rachel Bloom, who was also on the panel, asked Crane for an update on the fate of Ross and Rachel's relationship. \u201cYes,\" Crane replied, almost incredulously.\"Come on, they worked really hard, ten years.\u201d She then asked about how Monica and Chandler are doing and Crane advised her they're doing just fine too.\n\nDespite almost all of the cast asserting in various interviews there would never be Friends reunion, fans were still excited when a fan made trailer hit the internet earlier this year for a Friends movie. The clips were spliced together from various cast reunions on new shows, including Cox's Cougar Town and LeBlanc's Episodes. The 'trailer' quickly went viral with over 12 million views, proving that while a reunion may not ever happen, if it does it will definitely have an audience.\n\nThe Friends series finale was one of the most watched television series in U.S. history. Over 5 million people tuned in to watch the finale where all the characters got their happy endings. Despite many encouraging him to revisit the series, Crane is not interested: \u201cThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t want to see more of it, because it\u2019s all a happy ending.\u201d\n\nSource: TheWrap\n\n90 Day Fianc\u00e9: The Other Way's Paul Runs Away Again", "images": ["https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tg-logo-full-white.fc9e742a.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/sr-logo-full-white.b0cc2b44.svg", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/91f52889f6a04390a65ad2591c59986e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/th-logo-full-white.7684e614.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/hc-logo-full-white.5f66cfe4.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tr-logo-full-white.090c581a.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-white.fe72c74c.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-white.642d3d01.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-white.04a6f0d4.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/cb-logo-full-white.afca2e29.svg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-white.8242bbb9.svg", "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Elle-Macpherson-Friends.jpg", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tq-logo-full-white.7436bde3.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=297467373958238&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/ts-logo-full-white.54beb4cf.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Elle-Macpherson-Friends.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Yeoman", "Dan Zinski", "Helen Armitage"], "canonical_link": "https://screenrant.com/friends-tv-show-creator-revival/", "title": "Friends Co-Creator Says Revival Will Never Happen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Despite the persistent calls for a Friends TV show revival, the series' co-creator David Crane says it's never, ever happening.", "og": {"title": "Friends Co-Creator Says Revival Will Never Happen", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Elle-Macpherson-Friends.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}, "url": "https://screenrant.com/friends-tv-show-creator-revival/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "David Crane doesn't want to leave any room for doubt here.", "site_name": "ScreenRant"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-07T09:06:09Z", "section": "TV News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 822150531210883, "pages": 10765693196}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528362369.0, "source": "https://screenrant.com", "summary": ""}
