In my head, I sound amazing and then I turn around and her eyes are completely glazed over. I have no idea. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nCurrently on her Beautiful Trauma tour, Pink, 38, describes her own upbringing in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, as \u201cfree range, I guess.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Pink Admits She \u2018Laughed Out Loud\u2019 Upon Hearing Beautiful Issue Cover News: \u2018I Feel More Beautiful\u2019\n\n\u201cMy mom worked full time and went to school full time.

My parents obviously did not believe in that and I worked out okay. I always tell Willow, \u2018I\u2019m going to teach you the rules so that you\u2019ll know how and when to break them.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWatch the full episode of People Cover Story: Pink \u2013 How I\u2019m Raising Strong Kids, streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nThe singer also strives to create a gender-neutral environment for her brood. \u201cAbsolutely. [But] I feel like gender-neutral is in itself a label and I\u2019m label-less,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like labels at all so I believe that a woman and a girl can do anything.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Beautiful Issue Cover Star Pink Gets Candid About Her Marriage & How She Takes on the Haters\n\nMore than anything, Pink says she believes in \u201cfairness and justice. And I believe that a boy can do anything. So I have boys that flip dirt bikes and I have boy friends that wear dresses. It\u2019s all okay to me. It\u2019s whatever floats your boat.

I\u2019m such a worrier. They\u2019re going to be fine. They chose this family. They know what they\u2019re doing. But the world, I don\u2019t know if the world\u2019s going to be fine, and so I pray a lot. I cry a lot. I talk to them a lot. I hope a lot. I curse a lot.\u201d\n\nFor now, she and Hart, 42, \u201ctry not to take life too terribly seriously,\u201d Pink adds. \u201cWe laugh a lot.
