Good night.\u201d\n\nThe Internet, of course, loved Hoffman\u2019s flair for the dramatic. \u201cJackie Hoffman\u2019s \u201cDAMN IT! DAMN IT!\u201d is the secret iconic moment of the night,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n\nSee some of the best reactions to the moment below.\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "images": ["http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4946101/emmys-2017-jackie-hoffman-losing-reaction/", "title": "The Internet Is Loving This Hilariously Over-the-Top Reaction to Losing at the Emmys", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "emmy, emmys, emmy 2017, emmys 2017, stephen colbert, jackie hoffman, laura dern, jackie hoffman emmy, big little lies, laura dern emmy", "news_keywords": "emmy, emmys, emmy 2017, emmys 2017, stephen colbert, jackie hoffman, laura dern, jackie hoffman emmy, big little lies, laura dern emmy", "description": "The 2017 Emmys were full of hilarious moments, but the sneaky best bit of the night may have been Jackie Hoffman's reaction to losing.", "og": {"title": "The Internet Is Loving This Hilariously Over-the-Top Reaction to Losing at the Emmys", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4946101/emmys-2017-jackie-hoffman-losing-reaction/", "description": "\"What a national treasure\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1", "width": 780, "height": 550}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4946101/emmys-2017-jackie-hoffman-losing-reaction/", "description": "The 2017 Emmys were full of hilarious moments, but the sneaky best bit of the night may have been Jackie Hoffman's reaction to losing.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4946101/emmys-2017-jackie-hoffman-losing-reaction/", "title": "The Internet Is Loving This Hilariously Over-the-Top Reaction to Losing at the Emmys", "description": "\"What a national treasure\"", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
