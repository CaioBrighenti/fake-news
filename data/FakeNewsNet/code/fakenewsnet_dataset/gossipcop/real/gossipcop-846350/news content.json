Since then, Fonda has been known for supporting and championing dozens of causes, including the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential, for which she raised money at her big 80th birthday bash this past December. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t make a difference for famous people to speak out, the right wing wouldn\u2019t object. We are like repeaters,\u201d she told Vanity Fair then. \u201cRepeaters are the towers that you see at the top of mountains that pick up signals from the valley and carry them over the mountains to a broader audience. And that\u2019s what celebrities do, if we\u2019re doing our job right. We\u2019re picking up the voices of people who can\u2019t be heard and broadcasting their story.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb1a0285a3db395c90c/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d27afbc9d463f0008d45c08/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ugo-mulas-artists-lede-tout.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb67c22ac258e4f47aa/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss09.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb0037376305a00f894/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d1280deb1f2b451a90cf86b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-201908-BooksandSunglasses.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d0900e3ba72cabf53b23fbe/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/max-landis-abuse.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d02617a1af02c814569ff20/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/shutterstock_editorial_9642722s_huge.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d0bae71d7aeb035474661fe/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/prince-william-and-prince-harry.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbae01f7253cf1a1807b/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb5037376305a00f896/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbbc0c2c5233a346e7ec/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss12.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbba85bd6441b19cf5b3/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss11.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_400%2Cc_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d15f60a8d44360009846503/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb46048371b41b51332/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss07.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbaea0285a3db395c90a/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbae6048371b41b51330/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d029a0c76711f41b17fe69e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/meghans-eternity-ring-tout.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d1653747b45b600093c819f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Louis-Vuitton-X-Fairground-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbbaa0285a3db395c90e/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss10.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb65c7670327c1e55f7/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss08.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Rosemary Counter", "Yohana Desta", "Laura Bradley", "Katie Nicholl", "Hilary Weave", "Britt Hennemuth", "Lauren Mechling", "Erin Vanderhoof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2018/04/celebrity-activists", "title": "Celebrities-Turned-Activists Throughout the Years", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Audrey Hepburn was an ambassador for UNICEF, Elizabeth Taylor fought for AIDS research, and Jane Fonda caused an uproar on her way to making change.
