You still with me? Do you want to help her up? If everyone could give a little bit of space. Just chill for one second, we'll get some people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Uproxx the fan, named Annie, recalled the \u201chorrendous\u201d incident in a series of tweets in which she referred to the young singer as \u201cpure\u201d.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cHarry Styles stopped his entire show because I got crushed and then watched me being pulled over the barrier. That was one of the most horrendous panic attacks I\u2019ve ever had, like even the medics were terrified of the state I was in.\n\n\u201cHarry is so f****** pure I can\u2019t believe it.
