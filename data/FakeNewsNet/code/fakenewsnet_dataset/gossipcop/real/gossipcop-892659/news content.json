Seriously. Despite the pressure sure to arise from such concentrated limelight, the 26-year-old is not about to build her life (and diet) around the words of naysayers.\n\n\u201cI do what feels good for me at the time,\" Roberts told Shape magazine about her diet. \"I try not to say that I won't eat something. Instead, I stay in tune with my body and my mind, and I think, What do I feel like eating?\" And you know what? Sometimes all she wants is a cupcake.\n\n\u201cI love cupcakes, ice cream, and Sidecar Doughnuts,\u201d the American Horror Story star told the publication. \u201cSometimes I bring sweets for everyone at work as an excuse to eat them.\" Same girl, same.\n\nFor meals, however, Roberts keeps things fairly healthy, opting for \u201ca chopped salad with avocado, chicken, and tomatoes\u201d for lunch, and a \u201cturkey burger, or salmon with teriyaki or ponzu sauce, and brown rice with broccoli\u201d for dinner.\n\nWhen it comes to her workout routine, Roberts has a similar sense of balance.\n\nShe does yoga and pilates, as well as cardio with her trainer\u2014specifically focusing her efforts on the \u201call-important three A\u2019s\u201d: arms, abs, and ass.\n\nRELATED: Every Blonde Will Want Emma Roberts's Champagne Pop Hair This Fall\n\n\u201cI started working out regularly when I was living in New Orleans shooting American Horror Story: Coven several years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cI really fell in love with the food there. To counter all I was eating, I worked out more. It was a great balance: I'd have fried-chicken sliders at night and then go to my yoga class the next morning.\"\n\nWe can really see ourselves getting behind Emma\u2019s fitness regime.", "images": ["https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-645792986.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1144892086.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/gettyimages-1134962365.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1125499074.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/08/080918-justin-beiber-lead.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/gettyimages-1157601499.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/01/gettyimages-1072310724.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1152468545.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1147476594.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/070819-meghan-markle-suits-lead.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/gettyimages-1094653302.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1142056975_0.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1020266574.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-877024442.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/04/040318-adele-lead_0.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/gettyimages-1141611617.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/05/gettyimages-960101858.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/110917-emma-roberts.jpg?itok=FtdFjU83", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/06/khloe-kardashian-lead.jpg", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1147451711.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2019/07/gettyimages-1161254871.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/110917-emma-roberts.jpg?itok=FtdFjU83", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isabel Jones"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/emma-roberts-reveals-diet-fitness-regime", "title": "Emma Roberts Reveals Her Diet and Fitness Regime, and It's All About Balance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Celebrity,Body,Health & Fitness,News,Emma Roberts", "news_keywords": "workout, fitness, diet, emma roberts, shape, emma roberts diet", "description": "The actress got candid about her daily routine.", "og": {"title": "Emma Roberts Reveals Her Diet and Fitness Regime, and It's All About Balance", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle.com", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/emma-roberts-reveals-diet-fitness-regime", "description": "Cupcakes and bacon are NOT off the table.", "image": "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/110917-emma-roberts.jpg?itok=FtdFjU83"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/emma-roberts-reveals-diet-fitness-regime", "description": "The actress got candid about her daily routine.", "media": "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/110917-emma-roberts.jpg?itok=FtdFjU83"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/emma-roberts-reveals-diet-fitness-regime", "title": "Emma Roberts Reveals Her Diet and Fitness Regime, and It's All About Balance", "description": "Cupcakes and bacon are NOT off the table.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/110917-emma-roberts.jpg?itok=FtdFjU83"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
