The judge also ordered that the 28-year-old seek a mental health evaluation within two weeks of release.\n\nSarah Palin \u2019s parents were present in court, according to KTUU , while Todd said via telephone that the family was prepared to reestablish contact with Track if he was released.\n\nHowever, the Associated Press reports that the judge denied Track\u2019s attorney requested his bail be lowered from $5,000. As of Wednesday afternoon, Palin was still in custody, reports the Anchorage Daily News.\n\nImage zoom EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAccording to documents obtained by The Blast, Track\u2019s ex-wife Britta Hanson got a protective order against him and created a safeword for their 6-year-old daughter, Kyla, to use if she felt in danger while with him during visits at his home.\n\nAccording to the documents, after Kyla spent the night with Track on Nov. 25, Hanson alleged that she went to pick up her daughter to find him \u201ccussing and yelling\u201d before he \u201cgrabbed me and pushed me into the wall.\u201d\n\nHanson says in the documents that she followed Track and their child to his parents\u2019 house, where Track started throwing tools and threatened to beat up Todd when they confronted him. After that, the family decided Track could spend supervised time with his daughter by having Kyla dropped off at Sarah and Todd\u2019s house, according to the documents.\n\nAccording to the documents, Hanson was granted a temporary protective order which states that Track must stay at least 500 feet from Hanson, her home and her workplace for 20 days until a full hearing on the protective order request.\n\nImage zoom Track and Sarah Palin CQ Roll Call via AP Images\n\nTrack was arrested over the weekend on charges of domestic violence in relation to an incident that a source tells PEOPLE occurred at the Wasilla home of his parents. The former Alaska governor was the one who called the police to report the incident, which was over a disagreement regarding a truck Track wanted to pick up.\n\nA source close to the Palin family tells PEOPLE that the burglary charge came from allegedly breaking and entering at Sarah and Todd\u2019s home. As for the assault charge, \u201cTodd was the victim.\u201d Asked if Todd, who suffered life-threatening injuries in a serious snow machine crash last winter, was okay, the source replied: \u201cHe will be.\u201d\n\nThe insider added, \u201cA lot of other families have gone through worse.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Track has come in contact with the law. In January 2016, he was arrested after being accused of assaulting his girlfriend, Jordan Loewe, and pointing a gun at her. He\u2019s been serving two years of probation on a plea deal stemming from the arrest.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/vanessa-richey.jpg",
