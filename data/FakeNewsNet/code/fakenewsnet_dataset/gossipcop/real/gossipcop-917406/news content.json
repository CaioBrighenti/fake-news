{"url": "https://ew.com/recap/the-royals-season-3-premiere/", "text": "Image zoom Jim Marks/E!\n\nThe Royals S3 E1 type TV Show Network E! Genre Drama\n\nBecause of the whole \u201canarchy in the monarchy\u201d tagline for The Royals, I\u2019m going to be recapping season 3 in my own special way: naming superlatives and, in the process, using a whole bunch of sometimes repetitive, seriously bad puns. But, like the show itself, it\u2019ll be fun \u2014 that much I can promise.\n\nBut first, what actually went down in this premiere: We picked up just two weeks from the season 2 finale, which concluded with Liam revealing Royal Head of Security Ted Pryce as King Simon\u2019s killer, which subsequently led an angry mob of Brits to kill Pryce. Days later, Liam is still feeling the weight of that decision, and the blood of Pryce on his hands, so he\u2019s coping by keeping extremely busy with charity events, frequenting some sort of fight club, chats with Wilhelmina over sugary cereal, and plenty of booze. Eleanor, meanwhile, is pretty much the same, seemingly spending most of her time trying to make Jasper squirm as he tries to win her back.\n\nQueen Helena attempts to get her hands on King Simon\u2019s bones, only to find that his body isn\u2019t in his tomb \u2014 current King Cyrus has them \u2014 so now she\u2019ll have to pluck a hair from Cyrus\u2019 head to get a DNA test done to prove Liam\u2019s paternity\u2026 and his right to the throne. Meanwhile, cancer-stricken Cyrus has all but quarantined himself to his quarters, while Helena is simultaneously interviewing for a new Lord Chamberlain and setting up an appointment with a paid gent of another sort. That doesn\u2019t really work out so well when Rachel isn\u2019t clear and Helena winds up sleeping with the new Lord Chamberlain, Spencer Hoenigsberg, before meeting\u2026 (wait for it)\u2026 Huge Grant. Oops.\n\nMost Royally Badass Moment of the Week\n\nWhen you\u2019re a queen, you can clear an Underground station at the blink of an eye. Which is exactly what Helena did when she wanted to to meet in private with the woman at the heart of the #KingLiam movement: Wilhelmina. Expect much more for this unusual pairing \u2014 the actress who plays Wilhelmina, Genevieve Gaunt, is a series regular this season.\n\nMost Surprising Twist\n\nWe spent most of the episode getting short flashes of Robert surviving on a beach \u2014 quite well, it seems \u2014 living in a lean-to and catching fish to fulfill his royal sushi needs (although, poor guy, it doesn\u2019t appear he has a Wilson to keep him company). Of course, we just assumed he was hoping for a rescue at any moment. Only, when he heard a plane in the distance, he didn\u2019t fire his one flare. Instead, he put out his fire and flattened himself to the ground, hoping not to be seen. And then, he scratched out his own name on his helmet. Oh Robert, you can\u2019t stay on this beach forever\u2026\n\nCyrus\u2019 Most Conniving Moment\n\nNope, it wasn\u2019t when he poisoned Jeffrey Stewart after telling him he wasn\u2019t going to poison him in order to put a stop to the release of an incriminating video. It was that he\u2019d taken King Simon\u2019s dead body from his tomb and dropped him into the Thames, leaving a note that just said, \u201cGone Fishin'\u201d in the tomb for Helena to find.\n\nRunner Up: In an effort to keep Helena from his own DNA (which she wants to use for a paternity test to prove her children\u2019s rights to the throne), Cyrus goes full bubble boy when he\u2019s forced to meet with her.\n\nBest Performance By an Electric Razor\n\nYou talkin\u2019 to Cyrus? Because his new \u2018do looks oddly familiar.\n\nImage zoom\n\nMr. Hill\u2019s Winningest Move\n\nEver since his season 2 introduction, Eleanor\u2019s bodyguard, Mr. Hill, has become one of my favorite characters. He brings out the sweet, smart side of Eleanor without an ounce of stuffiness. So he\u2019s going to get a special category here. This week, every move he made in bringing Eleanor and Jasper back together was a delight, but his best move was, of course, showing Eleanor the security footage of Jasper\u2019s happy dance after she finally agreed to forgive him and go on a date with him.\n\nRunner Up: Mr. Hill going to Eleanor for her thoughts on his being offered the job of Head of Security was pretty effing great. Eleanor saying, \u201cThe way I see it, you wouldn\u2019t be leaving me \u2014 you\u2019d simply be looking after all of us, and I can\u2019t think of anyone more qualified,\u201d may have even put a little tear in my eye.\n\nWorst Paint Job\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, those green doors look TERRIBLE.\n\nNEXT: The outfit, quotes, and songs of the week\n\nShirtless Moment of the Week\n\nMeet HRH Tyler Durden. To blow off steam \u2014 and to punish himself for the death of Ted Pryce at the King\u2019s Cup at the conclusion of season 2 \u2014 Liam has been using the tunnels to visit some sort of underground fight club.\n\nImage zoom Jim Marks/E!\n\nBiggest HUH?!\n\nEvery once in a while, my memory is going to fail me, and I\u2019m hoping you fair readers, will help me out in the comments. This week, I was left scratching my head over Liam\u2019s blond bartender pal. At first, I assumed she just happened to be there and didn\u2019t mind patching up the super-hot royal after his whole fight club knockout (I sure wouldn\u2019t). But then, at the end, he says, \u201cI thought about you a lot. I should have done more for you.\u201d HUH?! Are we supposed to know who this woman is?\n\nEleanor\u2019s Outfit of the Week\n\nApparently, this is what a princess wears to paint her room. And it\u2019s amazing.\n\nImage zoom\n\nCrown Jewel Quips of the Episode\n\n\u201cI thought I smelled you: the queen\u2019s personal bouquet of spite and vagina.\u201d \u2014Cyrus\n\n\u201cThe people decided, and justice was served.\u201d \u2014Eleanor jumping in during a talk show appearance to help Liam answer a question about Pryce\u2019s death\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine \u2014 just try not to sleep with my mom.\u201d \u2014Liam, advising Jasper on getting Eleanor back\n\n\u201cPrincess Eleanor umbrellas, or, as we like to call them, Umbreleanors!\u201d \u2014a total idiot trying to get Eleanor\u2019s endorsement for an umbrella with a tacky crown on top\n\n\u201cThat smells like a whorehouse the next morning, and one of the whores has a yeast infection.\u201d \u2014Eleanor\u2019s reaction to \u201cElenoir\u201d perfume\n\n\u201cThey see this brave, fearless girl who is defiantly and perfectly herself, no matter how hard anyone tries to make her something else. It compels them.\u201d \u2014Jasper, perfectly summarizing why I love Eleanor\n\n\u201cHave some Froot Loops. They\u2019re the gateway drug to Apple Jacks.\u201d \u2014Wilhelmina\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the King of England \u2014 I don\u2019t do my own wet work.\u201d \u2014Cyrus just before killing Jeffrey Stewart\n\n\u201cSo a pack of wild dogs dragged you through the streets \u2014 that\u2019s what you\u2019re going with?\u201d \u2014the pretty bartender as she cleans up Liam\u2019s face\n\nBest Musical Cues of the Week\n\n\u201cAlive,\u201d by Sia, as we first see Robert on the beach\n\n\u201cLegendary,\u201d by Welshy Arms, as Cyrus shaves his head\n\n\u201cHoly Ground,\u201d by BANNERS, as Cyrus dumps Jeffery Stewart\u2019s body and Eleanor and Jasper paint\n\nEpisode grade: A-", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/royals.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/the-royals-2016-1343full.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/150182_2290.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/blindspot-1-2000.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/nup_186718_2179.jpg?crop=0px%2C71px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/nup_186862_2069.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/true-detective-recap.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/blackmirror_season5_06.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/agents-of-shield.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/007_violet_301_unit_00516r3.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/the-royals-2016-20991.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/the-royals-2016-20991.jpg?w=800&h=533&crop=1", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/black-mirror-1-2000.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rhobh-2-1200.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/tp-pilot2_sc60-em_0080.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/114182_0666b.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/true-detective-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jessica-jones2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a34_promo_stills_022519.0043_r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/NUP_183826_0306.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/150245_7060.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/eleanor.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/115225_d0454-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C177px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/billions_411_712.r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/drag-race-8.jpg?crop=44px%2C0px%2C2941px%2C1556px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/the-royals-2016-20991.jpg?w=800&h=533&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Breanne L.
