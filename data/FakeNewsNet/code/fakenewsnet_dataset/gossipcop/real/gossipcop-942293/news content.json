Dutch officials told local newspaper De Volkskrant that Queen M\u00e1xima is allegedly \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d over news of her sister\u2019s passing. The publication also reported that In\u00e9s battled mental health issues and was recently admitted to a psychiatric clinic to treat an eating disorder and depression.\n\n\u201cThe sudden death of Queen M\u00e1xima\u2019s sister comes as a big shock,\u201d Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said, per The Guardian, \u201cIt is intensely sad and heartbreaking news that can hardly be comprehended by those who stay behind. With our hearts and our thoughts we are with the queen and her family. I wish them all the strength necessary to carry this horrible loss together. And I trust that they will get the peace and space for that.\u201d\n\nThe royal has reportedly canceled appearences scheduled for the next 10 days and plans to travel from Holland to Buenos Aires. She seemed to be close to Zorreguieta, who was a bridesmaid in her 2002 wedding to the crown prince, Willem-Alexander. Zorreguieta was also the godmother to their third child, Princess Ariana of the Netherlands, 11.\n\nIn\u00e9s\u2019s death comes nearly one year after she and M\u00e1xima suffered the loss of their father, Jorge Zorreguieta, who died at age 89 in August 2017.\n\nIf you or anyone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
