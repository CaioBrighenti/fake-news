The film delves into the ballroom subculture of '80s New York, characterised by black, Latino, gay and transgender communities.\n\n\"Watch it and find out where you got your culture from,\" Waithe said, noting that although many of the people featured in the film have since passed away, their legacies would live on.\n\n\"Every time someone says shade or talks about reading or just decides to serve face for no reason at all, please look up to the sky and give thanks because we owe them a huge debt of gratitude.\n\n\"They strutted through a brick wall so we wouldn't have to.\"", "images":
