Many celebrities, including Iggy Azalea, expressed their support over Twitter, and jokingly acknowledged how the earth stopped after the news broke.\n\nCongrats to Kylie Jenner for winning the superbowl \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc51 \u2014 Amy Elizabeth \ud83d\udc9c (@AmyCim) February 4, 2018\n\nKylie Jenner\u2019s daughter when she saw who her parents were pic.twitter.com/ILWg72TyM2 \u2014 Rev.
