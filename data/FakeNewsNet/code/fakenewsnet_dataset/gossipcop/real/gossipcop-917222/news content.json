But Rick has a very famous next-door neighbor\u2026Sharon Tate,\u201d Tarantino added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working on this script for five years, as well as living in Los Angeles County most of my life, including in 1969, when I was 7 years old,\u201d Tarantino said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to tell this story of an L.A., and a Hollywood that don\u2019t exist anymore. And I couldn\u2019t be happier about the dynamic teaming of DiCaprio & Pitt as Rick & Cliff.\u201d\n\nTarantino previously worked with Pitt in \u201cInglourious Basterds,\u201d which was nominated for eight Academy Awards. DiCaprio starred in the Tarantino\u2019s \u201cDjango Unchained,\u201d which scored five Oscar nods.\n\nThe film will be released worldwide on August 9, 2019. Opening on the 50th anniversary of the day that the Manson family committed the LaBianca murders and the day after Tate was killed, the film will head off against \u201cArtemis Fowl,\u201d Disney\u2019s adaptation of the popular sci-fi and fantasy series.\n\nSony beat out several bidders, including Warner Bros. and Paramount, for rights to the film. The movie \u2014 shrouded in secrecy \u2014 is believed to involve Charles Manson and the Manson family murders. It\u2019s the first pic that Tarantino is releasing without the Weinstein Company.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
