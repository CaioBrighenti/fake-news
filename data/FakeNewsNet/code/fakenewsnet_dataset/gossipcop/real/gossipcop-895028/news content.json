Despite her bravery, many viewers criticized the 25-year-old for allegedly lip-synching her latest single, \u201cWolves.\u201d\n\nA newly blonde Gomez hit the stage at Los Angeles\u2019 Microsoft Theater in a short white nightgown and sneakers for her first performance in more than a year. She was joined by DJ Marshmello and a group of backup dancers. At the end of the song, Gomez appeared downcast as she shrugged at the applause from the star-studded audience and mouthed, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just about to say how nice it was to see all the performers singing live and not lip synching\u2026.until Selena Gomez came on\u2026 #AMAs,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. Another tweeted, \u201cWait wait wait\u2026 okay y\u2019all not trying to bash on anyone\u2019s performance but was that a lip sync slip up or like some really loud back up vocals in Selena Gomez \u2018s performance likeeeee\u2026. genuinely asking #AMAs #2017.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBad Liar\u201d singer\u2019s legion of fans were quick to clap back. \u201cSelena did amazing tonight. I don\u2019t care what others say. Stay pressed. We Selenators are proud of our idol and for how hard she\u2019s worked and everything she\u2019s gone through. We love you Selena. You did great,\u201d one fan tweeted. A second added, \u201cmay i remind y\u2019all selena is still recovering from a kidney transplant and she just gave the performance of a lifetime. words can not express how emotional i\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d\n\nLater in the night, Gomez thanked her fans for supporting her performance. \u201cThank you to my best friend Petra [Collins] for helping me bring it to life,\u201d she said in a video on her Instagram story alongside the caption, \u201cgrateful grateful grateful.\u201d\n\nThe Disney alum has yet to publicly address the lip-synching rumors.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
