While we are confident that this is the right choice for us, it has for sure not been an easy one to come to terms with,\" they wrote on their blog Tuesday. \"Our family has grown up alongside yours, and we have felt you rooting us on from the other side of the screen. How bittersweet to say goodbye to the very thing that introduced us all in the first place.\"\n\nThe married couple, who have four children, also opened up in their post about why they're walking away from the wildly successful series, citing their exhausting schedule and also addressing recent rumors of marital issues. \"We would be foolish to think we can go and go and fire on all cylinders and never stop to pause. Our family is healthy and our marriage has honestly never been stronger,\" they wrote. \"This has nothing to do with a fraudulent skincare line or anything else you\u2019ll inevitably read. This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment. Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.\"\n\nAccording to their post, the final season of Fixer Upper will launch in November. Debuting on HGTV in 2013, the makeover series sees the pair renovate old houses in and around their base of Waco, Texas, as they aim to not only create a better house, but also a better neighborhood. The show has become one of HGTV's biggest hits, doubling its ratings in its second season and drawing A-list fans like Taylor Swift and Leslie Jones.\n\nThe most recent season ran 17 episodes and wrapped in March and drew 3.7 million viewers. Season five was part of a multi-season renewal aimed to keep the show on the air through 2018, when the series finale will now air. The success of the series also been a boon for the Gaines personally. Joanna's Instagram boasts 5.3 million followers, while Chip has 2.5 million. The duo recently launched their own Target line, among their other business ventures.\n\nDespite the staggering success of Fixer Upper, the Gaines have been careful about expanding their brand too much, notably insisting on doing no more than 16 episodes a season of the series. \"We're local businesspeople, so we're thinking very local. 'Seize it while it's here,' that's what we hear, but we want this brand to last,\" Joanna told THR in 2016. \"TV is just part of the equation.\"\n\nHigh Noon Entertainment produced the series for HGTV.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/scale_crop_768_433/2017/03/g99a6179lgedt-h_2017_thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2019/01/dick_wolf_chuck_lorre_kenya_barris_amy_poehler_greg_berlanti__split_0.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/11/this_is_us_ncis_empire_supergirl_modern_family_split.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/g99a6179lgedt-h_2017_thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2019/05/oitnb_s7_production_still_2-h_2019.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/g99a6179lgedt-h_2017_thr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Stanhope", "Kate.Stanhope Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fixer-upper-end-season-5-1043050", "title": "'Fixer Upper' to End After Season 5 on HGTV", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Joanna and Chip Gaines announced the news Tuesday on their blog.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fixer-upper-end-season-5-1043050", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "'Fixer Upper' to End After Season 5 on HGTV", "description": "Joanna and Chip Gaines announced the news Tuesday on their blog.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/03/g99a6179lgedt-h_2017_thr.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "'Fixer Upper' to End After Season 5 on HGTV", "description": "Joanna and Chip Gaines announced the news Tuesday on their blog.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fixer-upper-end-season-5-1043050", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/g99a6179lgedt-h_2017_thr.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "'Fixer Upper' to End After Season 5 on HGTV", "sailthru.description": "Joanna and Chip Gaines announced the news Tuesday on their blog.", "sailthru.author": "Kate Stanhope", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-26 09:13:05", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, Fixer Upper"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506431585.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
