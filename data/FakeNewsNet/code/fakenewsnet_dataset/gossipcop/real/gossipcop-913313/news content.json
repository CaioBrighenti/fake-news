Kris Jenner was born on November 5, 1955, in San Diego, California. She married Robert Kardashian in 1978. They had four children before they divorced in 1991: Robert Jr., Kim, Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9. She married Bruce Jenner (now identified as Caitlyn Jenner) that same year and started managing the family franchise. The couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie. In 2007, Keeping Up with the Kardashians aired, giving rise to several spin-offs. In 2013, Kris hosted her own short-lived talk show.\n\nEarly Years Kris Jenner was born Kristen Mary Houghton on November 5, 1955, in San Diego, California. Her father, Robert Houghton, was an aircraft engineer. Kris has one younger sister named Karen. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website When Kris' parents divorced in 1962, her mother sold the family home in the Point Loma area of San Diego. Kris and her mom and sister then moved to Clairemont, California, where Kris attended Longfellow Elementary School. A year after her parents' divorce, Kris developed a cancerous bone tumor. Fortunately, the cancer did not spread. After undergoing surgery to remove the tumor, Kris was given a clean bill of health. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

Three months after moving to Oxnard, California, Harry's business partner ran off with all the company's money. As a result, the family moved back to San Diego. When Kris graduated from Clairemont High School, she was far more interested in becoming a wife and mother than going to college.\n\nMarriage to Robert Kardashian On July 8, 1978, Kris married successful high-powered attorney, Robert Kardashian, whose best friend was athlete and actor O.J. Simpson. Kris became close friends with Simpson's wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. Kris and Robert's marriage yielded four children: three daughters, Kourtney, Kim and Khlo\u00e9, and a son named Robert, after his father. The couple divorced in 1991. In the 1990s, Kris was devastated to learn that her friend, Nicole Brown Simpson, had been killed and that Nicole's husband, O.J. Simpson, was being accused of her murder. Kris' ex-husband, Robert Kardashian, gained national fame by serving on Simpson's defense team during Simpson's highly publicized trial. Simpson was ultimately acquitted of criminal charges but found liable in the civil case that followed. In 2003, Robert Kardashian died of esophageal cancer.\n\nMarriage to Bruce Jenner Just after her divorce from Kardashian was final, Kris married former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Bruce Jenner in 1991. As a result, she became the stepmother of Bruce's children from his two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brandon and Brody Jenner. Kris and her husband, Bruce, also had two daughters of their own: Kendall and Kylie. When Kris married Bruce, she became not only his wife, but his manager. Soon, Kris was negotiating his endorsement deals and promoting his career as a racecar driver, in addition to directing the family franchise. However, it was clear that Kris and Bruce were having challenges in their marriage, as seen on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. In June 2013 the couple separated and shortly after, divorced in December 2014. The reality of their breakup was made even more clear when Bruce came out as transgender in April 2015. That fall he officially changed his name to Caitlyn and began identifying as female. The E! Network gave Caitlyn a spinoff series, called I Am Cait, documenting her gender transition.", "images": ["https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE4MDAzNDEwNjA3MTc5Mjc4/molly-pitcher-38996-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NDg0MDU0ODk5NjIzNDM5/mary-mcleod-bethune-9211266-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_458/MTQ1NTMzOTkyNDA0MjY0NTAz/sitelogowhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE4MDAzNDEwNDMxMTQ5NTgy/madeleine-albright-9179300-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_170%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTQ1MTQwOTQ3MzMwNTQxMDI1/khlo-and-lamar---mini-biography.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTE5NDg0MDU1MzgxMzc4NTc1/the-hollywood-reporters-annual-power-100-women-in-entertainment-breakfast---arrivals.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE4MDAzNDEwNzAxODEzMjYy/maria-tallchief-9501522-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE1ODA0OTcxMjYwMjgyMzgx/elisabeth-vigee-lebrun-37280-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_170%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTQ1MTQwOTQ2MjU2Nzk5MjAx/bruce-jenner---mini-biography.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_170%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTQ1MTQwOTQ4NjcyNzE4MzA1/scott-disick--kourtney-kardashian---mini-biography.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE4MDAzNDEwNjE5ODkzMjYy/mary-tudor-i-9401296-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NDg0MDU0OTI0MDY4MzY3/agatha-christie-9247405-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_170%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTQ1MTQwOTQ5NDc4Mjg2ODE3/kim-kardashian---mini-biography.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTIwNjA4NjMzODAzNzM2NTg4/mamie-eisenhower-9285497-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTQ1NTM0MTQ5NzA3NDQxNzE5/navbarwhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTIwNjA4NjMzNDg5MDk4MjUy/saint-katharine-drexel-38810-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NDg0MDU1MzgxMzc4NTc1/the-hollywood-reporters-annual-power-100-women-in-entertainment-breakfast---arrivals.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NDg0MDU1MzgxMzc4NTc1/the-hollywood-reporters-annual-power-100-women-in-entertainment-breakfast---arrivals.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.biography.com/personality/kris-jenner", "title": "Kris Jenner", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "Rw9Z4UJK89QUjgFzrFI2QbZmTRyWu_Cuy15hu4Y1MXw", "msvalidate.01": "565AA37CB662E60BF24DDCABEC686D8F", "generator": "Tempest -
