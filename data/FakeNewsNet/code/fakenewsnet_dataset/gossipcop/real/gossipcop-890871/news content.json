Mandy Moore took to Instagram to share an emotional post on Friday, Jan. 23 \u2014 the same day that news broke that she and husband Ryan Adams are calling it quits.\n\nThe singer and actress, 30, posted an image of two orange traffic signs against a cloudy blue sky. The top sign, in the shape of a diamond, reads, \"Mercury Retrograde.\" It sits atop a rectangular sign reading, \"PROCEED WITH CAUTION.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrity Splits of 2014\n\nReferencing the planetary movement that is believed to inspire bad luck and unexpected events, Moore captioned the image, \"Message received. #thatexplainsit #theworst.\"\n\nThe \"Candy\" singer may have been looking for an explanation for the end of her relationship. Moore and her now estranged husband Adams, 40, confirmed their split on Friday, releasing a statement to Us reading, \"Mandy Moore and Ryan Adams have mutually decided to end their marriage of almost 6 years. It is a respectful, amicable parting of ways and both Mandy and Ryan are asking for media to respect their privacy at this time.\"\n\nMessage received. #thatexplainsit #theworst A photo posted by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Jan 23, 2015 at 9:52am PST\n\nPHOTOS: Mandy Moore and Ryan Adams\n\nThe Red Band Society actress wed the indie rocker in March 2009 after Adams proposed just one month prior. The two stars began dating in late 2007.\n\nYears before she met Adams, a young Moore reflected on her own lack of experience with heartbreak in an interview with PBS in 2003. Speaking in promotion of her movie How to Deal, Moore was in the midst of a relationship with tennis player Andy Roddick. She had already split from her early 2000s boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama, and would go on to date Zach Braff before coupling up with Adams.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood's Broken Engagements\n\n\"I haven't had too much trauma with love,\" she told PBS. \"I'm sure it's coming sometime because you can't escape it.
