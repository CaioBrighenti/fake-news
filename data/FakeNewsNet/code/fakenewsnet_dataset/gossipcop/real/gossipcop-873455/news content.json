But according to Kylie Jenner, rocking turquoise, purple, pink, and neon yellow wigs is surprisingly more tiring than we thought.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s episode of Life of Kylie, Jenner shares that she\u2019s ready to break away from the wig-mania while planning her 2017 Coachella look. \"Honestly, like, guys I don't want to disappoint anybody, but I just want my hair long and black and pretty,\" Jenner tells makeup artist Ariel Tejada, her assistant Victoria Gamero, and her right hand gal Jordyn Woods.\n\nWoods also agreed with Jenner, stating that a classic look would come as a surprise to fans who will most likely be expecting a bright-colored wig for this event. \"I don't want to be a weirdo. I don't want to pull up with purple hair\u2014I'm over it,\u201d Jenner responded.\n\nJenner\u2019s bold style choices have played a huge role in building the reality star\u2019s brand, and it has been a way for Jenner to set herself apart from her famed sisters. But maintaining this appearance has proven to be tiring for the reality star, and she shares that she\u2019s ready to tone things down a bit.\n\n\ud83d\ude0f A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Jul 19, 2016 at 12:42am PDT\n\n\"I always try to be different. I always try to do new things. I think my following started to get a little bigger when I was just figuring out my style and who I was,\" she shares. \"Not everyone was dying their hair blue and green, you know.\"\n\n\"I'm over keeping up with this lifestyle of crazy hair and wigs and s**, she continues. Instead, Jenner jokingly lists, \u201ccool earrings, makeup, and my t-ts out,\u201d as her new focus.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re an avid follower of Jenner, then you know that she ended up deciding on a short purple wig and neon yellow wig for Coachella.\n\n\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udc7f A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Apr 15, 2017 at 2:32pm PDT\n\nhighlighter hair \ud83c\udf08 A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Apr 14, 2017 at 4:01pm PDT\n\nHowever, since then we have been seeing way more of Kylie\u2019s natural black hair.\n\n\ud83c\udf3b A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Aug 14, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT\n\nhello \ud83d\udda4 A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Aug 3, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT\n\nCould her infamous wigs be gone for good?
