Chloe Kim\u2019s incredible gold-medal run\n\nGOLD for Chloe Kim!

Ester Ledecka\u2019s double gold\n\nLedecka, a world champion snowboarder, came to these Games without a single career top-10 finish on skis. She not only stunned the world by winning women\u2019s super-G, but dominated parallel snowboard giant slalom to become the first athlete to win gold in skiing and snowboarding competitions at the same games.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t finish last in cross country!\n\n11.

Chloe Kim establishing herself as the greatest Olympic Twitterer\n\nCould be down for some ice cream rn \u2014 Chloe Kim (@chloekimsnow) February 12, 2018\n\nOh and I also had 2 churros today and they were pretty bomb so if you ever get nervous go eat a churro \u2014 Chloe Kim (@chloekimsnow) February 11, 2018\n\nI am my own Valentine \ud83d\udc96 \u2014 Chloe Kim (@chloekimsnow) February 15, 2018\n\n22. Mark McMorris\u2019 inspiring comeback\n\nMcMorris suffered near-fatal injuries last March after hitting a tree in the backcountry of British Columbia and needed two surgeries after suffering a fractured jaw, a fractured left arm, a ruptured spleen, a pelvic fracture, rib fractures and a collapsed left lung. Less than a year later, he was back on the Olympic stage, and he left Pyeongchang with a bronze medal.\n\n23.
