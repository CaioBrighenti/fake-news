From ages one through six, Webster lived with his grandmother in South Park, Houston. Located in south-central Houston, the neighborhood was notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, \"Growing up, my grandmother stayed in the hood so I seen random crazy shit. [I saw] mad bums and crazy spazzed out motherfuckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry, and grimey [sic]. I was always like, \u2018I gotta get the fuck out this shit.\u2019 It gave me my edge\u2014[it made me] who I am right now.\"[7] Webster moved to Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own business.[8] Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather was a jazz composer.[9] Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen.[10] Webster then attended the University of Texas San Antonio, before dropping out his sophomore year to fully pursue his music career.[11][12][13][14][15][16]\n\nAfter dropping out, Webster immediately moved to New York City in an attempt to start his music career.

Eventually frustrated in New York and the lack of progression,[17] Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, after only four months in the state.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Webster was abandoned by his friend who had promised to help him by providing housing. His parents cut him off financially and he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents kicked him out of their home. Webster moved back to Los Angeles once again and began to sleep on the couch of a friend who studied at University of Southern California.[19] Atlanta-based rapper and owner of Grand Hustle Records, T.I. would later hear one of Webster's productions, titled \"Lights (Love Sick)\". While in Los Angeles, T.I.'s representative contacted Webster, asking him to attend a studio for a meeting.
