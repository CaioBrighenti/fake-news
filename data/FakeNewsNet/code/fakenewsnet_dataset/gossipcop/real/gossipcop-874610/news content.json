Today, the trailer was release for the upcoming season of Lip Sync Battle and Luna's cameo in it is obviously adorable.\n\nThe fifth season of the show \u2014 yes, there really have been that many installments \u2014 premieres January 17, 2019, and, when it does, Luna Simone Stephens is going to steal the show. The toddler doesn't lip sync in the next season of the series, but she does cheer on Big Bird and Elmo while they do. All the while Luna sits on her dad's shoulders and lap, as her mom is on host duty, dancing to The Black Eyed Peas' 2010 hit \"I Gotta Feeling.\" \"We loooooove Big Bird,\" Legend says.\n\nOf course, little else is given away by the trailer. But it does present a wide spectrum of guests in the fifth season of Lip Sync Battle . The guest list is stacked, too. Everyone from Mariah Carey and Serena Williams (doing Beyonc\u00e9, of course ) to Darren Criss, Jason Schwartzman, Nico Tortorella, Molly Bernard, Jermaine Dupri, Boris Kodjoe, Pitbull, Vanessa Morgan, Andy Grammer, Andy Roddick, Brooklyn Decker, and Lele Pons make appearances.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nWilliams isn't the only one who takes on Beyonc\u00e9 in the next season; the Fab Five of Queer Eye also do their best Bey impressions. They dressed for the part, too, in the pop star's Coachella headlining set uniform of cutoff jean shorts and a cropped yellow letterman sweatshirt. There's even more Bey cosplay as Karamo Brown wears her costume from the music video for \"Telephone\" as Jonathan Van Ness dons Lady Gaga's attire from the same clip. \"I feel like Beyonc\u00e9, are you kidding me?,\" Brown says.\n\nTeigen recently talked about how she and cohost LL Cool J are able to draw so many big names to the show and, apparently, it couldn't be easier. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t have to recruit that many people,\u201d she told Billboard earlier this year as the fourth season premiered. \u201cI get people coming up to me saying that they want to be on the show. And that\u2019s always fun to see at, like, the Met Ball.\u201d Few guests, though, if any, look like they're having as much fun as her daughter, Luna.", "images": ["https://www.wmagazine.com/images/w_logo.svg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f186c802c577242df3efc/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Emma%20Stone.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/teenvogue-services/photos/591b21e645a06456b6861769/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Angelina%20Jolie.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/591a0f0b2006e2187de4708d/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Kate%20Moss.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5c11b622fc1d89676e794fdb/3:2/w_640/Screen%2520Shot%25202018-12-12%2520at%25205.29.46%2520PM.png", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5c11b622fc1d89676e794fdb/2:1/w_790,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-12%20at%205.29.46%20PM.png"], "top_img": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5c11b622fc1d89676e794fdb/2:1/w_790,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-12-12%20at%205.29.46%20PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marissa G.
