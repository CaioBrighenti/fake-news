The magical moment was captured by celebrity photographer Michael Segal and his team at Michael Segal Photography.\n\nThe urban chic celebration, put together by Charley King of Blue Bell Events, was infused with copper, gray and blush tones throughout the decor. Guests enjoyed a buffet-style meal from Tres La Catering that included bites such as steak and eggs, Maine lobster rolls, quinoa spinach bites and more. Partygoers also jammed out to tunes from DJ Dom at Red Shoe LA.\n\nImage zoom\n\nFROM PEN: Confetti, Sweets and Dogs: How Julianne Hough Had a Picture Perfect Wedding to Brooks Laich\n\nTouni, a broker and attorney based out of northern California, popped the question to Daniel after a four-mile romantic hike overlooking San Francisco Bay on Christmas Day last year.\n\n\u201cI said yes! My world just became brighter today,\u201d Daniel, 41, captioned a selfie of the pair, in which she\u2019s flashing a gorgeous diamond ring for the camera while the Golden Gate Bridge can be seen in the background.\n\n\u201c#engagement #christmas #love #proposal #marinheadlands #family @adam.touni.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Daniel opened up exclusively to PEOPLE about her battle with stage IV non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which she has since recovered from.\n\n\u201cIt happened so suddenly,\u201d she said of her 2011 diagnosis. \u201cThere is is no way I would have ever gotten through this without my family. My family is everything to me and I feel like they saw me through this.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Brittany Daniel/Instagram\n\nAnd one person who\u2019s been by her side through thick and thin (and wedding planning!)? Her sister, Cynthia.\n\n\u201cI think that Cyn and I have so many interests that all go together perfectly,\u201d Brittany previously told PEOPLE of her and Cynthia\u2019s lifestyle blog, The Sweet Life, launch earlier this month. \u201cI think secretly we just want to spend more time together!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: \u2018Sweet Valley High\u2019 Alum Brittany Daniel Opens Up About \u2018Love
