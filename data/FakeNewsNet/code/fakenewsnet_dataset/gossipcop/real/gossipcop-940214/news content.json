News, Serena Williams reveals that she intends to reclaim the no. 1 spot in the tennis world.\n\n\u201cAs a tennis player and as the best in the world,\u201d Serena shares, \u201cyou have to have that discipline. You have to bring that. But then when I became a mom, it was like, \u2018Now I understand what everyone\u2019s talking about.'\u201d\n\nThe grand-slam champ says that after she became a mom to daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., her priorities have changed but her drive to succeed certainly has not.\n\n\u201cIn some weird way, I still want to be the best in what I do, whether it\u2019s fashion or tennis. I just want to be the best and I want to work the hardest. I also want to be the best mom. Why limit myself?\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Serena was back at the French Open.
