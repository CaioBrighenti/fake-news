Now, the successful entertainer has joined forces with PETA for an ad and exclusive video informing his fans about the abuse that occurs behind the scenes in animal circuses.\n\nThe Fuller House star wants his fans to know that unlike clowns and acrobats, animals don\u2019t choose to perform in circuses\u2014they\u2019re forced to do so through beatings and intimidation. \u201cWhat we see in the circus is just a fraction of what these poor animals have to go through,\u201d he says.\n\nBears, elephants, tigers, and other animals don\u2019t voluntarily ride bicycles, stand on their heads, balance on balls, jump through rings of fire, or perform other confusing tricks\u2014they do so because they\u2019re afraid of the painful punishment they\u2019ll endure if they refuse.\n\nJuan Pablo discusses his love for felines, including lions and tigers, whom circuses cart from town to town in barren cages, denying them the opportunity to fulfill their basic needs to exercise, roam, socialize, forage, and play. Many big cats are forced to eat, drink, sleep, defecate, and urinate in the same small space. \u201cTo see what things are done to them in the circus is really upsetting,\u201d he says.\n\nWatch our behind-the-scenes video to hear Juan Pablo explain why kids shouldn\u2019t be taken to circuses that use animals:\n\nPlease never patronize animal circuses. If one is scheduled to come to your town, you can call on authorities to cancel it and, if it goes ahead, demonstrate outside the show. Encourage your friends and family members to pledge not to buy tickets to animal circuses by sharing this page!\n\nNever forget: Every ticket funds cruelty to animals. Pledge never to go to a circus that uses animals now!", "images": ["https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Buddy-and-Cooper-396x240.jpg?20180405035015", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo-blue.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/THfS-Sunshade_RVSD-396x240.jpg?20190712063025", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juan-Pablo-Di-Pace-1.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juan-Pablo-Di-Pace-602x793.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/plugins/peta-optimization/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/VIV_ratinlab_SI_CR_COI_DB-396x240.jpg?20181220065050", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo-white.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lonnie-Walker-Featured-Image-668x336-1562705453.png?20190709085053", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tiger-2076841_1920-198x120.jpg?20170620025417", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Unleash-2-668x336-1562862511.png?20190711042831", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/footer-ingrid-bg-600x320.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Michael-Keaton-Featured-Image-668x336-1562688484.jpg?20190709040804", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PETA-Chilli-Circus-Featured-Image-668x336-1562001117.png?20190701051157", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-logo.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Unleash-2-396x240-1562862519.png?20190711042839", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/bunny.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juan-Pablo-Di-Pace-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.peta.org/features/fuller-house-juan-pablo-di-pace-circus-cruelty/", "title": "Juan Pablo Di Pace: Extinguish Circus Cruelty", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=421236952", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 5647744585}, "cf-cache-tags": "ccm-875202", "description": "The \"Fuller House\" star doesn't want kids to go to circuses that use animals: \"I wouldn't want them to think it's OK, because it's not.\"", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Juan Pablo Di Pace: Extinguish Circus Cruelty | PETA", "description": "The \"Fuller House\" star doesn't want kids to go to circuses that use animals: \"I wouldn't want them to think it's OK, because it's not.\"", "url": "https://www.peta.org/features/fuller-house-juan-pablo-di-pace-circus-cruelty/", "site_name": "PETA", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juan-Pablo-Di-Pace-1.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juan-Pablo-Di-Pace-1.jpg", "width": 1100, "height": 645}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/officialpeta", "section": "Celebrities"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The \"Fuller House\" star doesn't want kids to go to circuses that use animals: \"I wouldn't want them to think it's OK, because it's not.\"", "title": "Juan Pablo Di Pace: Extinguish Circus Cruelty | PETA", "site": "@peta", "image": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Juan-Pablo-Di-Pace-1.jpg", "creator": "@peta"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "pubdate": 20180111}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/08Bx3psTCmc?wmode=transparent&rel=0"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.peta.org", "summary": ""}
