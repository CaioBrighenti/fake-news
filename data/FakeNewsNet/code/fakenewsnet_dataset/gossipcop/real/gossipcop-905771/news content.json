Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nWhen Natalie Portman introduced the Best Director candidates at the Golden Globes as the \u201call-male nominees,\u201d it inspired a bit of controversy. Onscreen, it appeared as if the directors \u2014 Martin McDonagh, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, and Guillermo del Toro \u2014 might have been a bit miffed. However, you can at least consider the smiling eye roll that del Toro gave to the camera to be a sheepish reaction instead of an offended one. The Shape of Water filmmaker and Globe recipient for Best Director told IndieWire that he approves of Portman\u2019s comment, \u201cI think it was great! She should say exactly what she feels. There is phenomenal work being done by female directors.\u201d He then cited three films that were helmed by women directors in 2017 that could have also received award nods. \u201cMudbound, Lady Bird, and Wonder Woman are all terrific,\u201d he said.\n\nIf this year\u2019s Oscars are anything like the Golden Globes, hopefully del Toro will pass on the memo to his rivals. For what it\u2019s worth, Spielberg doesn\u2019t believe women will be shut out of the upcoming Academy Awards Oscars.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-new.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-crawl.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-hopper-david-harbour-stranger-things-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Dressing-Funny-Rachel-Dratch-Tina-Fey.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-r-kelly.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-stuber.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-arti-gollapudi.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-billie-eilish-song-of-the-week.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/big-brother-sunday.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-julio-torres.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/10/10-Guillermo-del-Toro.w330.h330.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-lil-wayne.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/15/15-r-kelly-criminal-record.w536.h536.jpg ", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/10/10-Guillermo-del-Toro.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-mindhunter.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-review.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-TomKennyMemes.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-wife.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-conan-sona.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Oliver-Jackson-Cohen.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Wet-Hot-American-MidSommar.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/10/10-Guillermo-del-Toro.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tolly Wright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/guillermo-del-toro-approves-of-portmans-all-male-intro.html", "title": "Guillermo del Toro Approves of Natalie Portman\u2019s \u2018All-Male Nominees\u2019 Comment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Guillermo del Toro Approves of Natalie Portman\u2019s \u2018All-Male Nominees\u2019 Comment", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/guillermo-del-toro-approves-of-portmans-all-male-intro.html", "description": "\u201cI think it was great!
