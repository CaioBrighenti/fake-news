But Selena's latest post has fans expressing their love and support for the star by making a donation to the Lupus Research Alliance, and those donations are adding up in a big way.\n\n\"Selena has supported our organization in many ways,\" Kenneth Farber, president and CEO of the Lupus Research Alliance told E! News. He explained that her efforst have included \"donating a portion of tickets sales for her last concert tour to the Lupus Research Alliance and requesting donations to us on the occasion of her birthday, as well as yesterday's announcement. Together her appeals have raised almost $500,000 for research funded by the Lupus Research Alliance.\"\n\nSelena's most recent call to action came in the form of an Instagram caption that also revealed she had received a kidney transplant this summer to help treat her lupus. After thanking friend and actress Francia Ra\u00edsa for donating her kidney, Selena focused on the disease itself and what can be done to help fuel the fight against it. \"Lupus continues to be very misunderstood but progress is being made,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"For more information regarding Lupus please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org/ -by grace through faith.\" (Francia posted a similar Instagram message to her social media pages.)\n\nThe Instagram post drove more than donations to the website. \"Selena's openness and strong emotional connection to her worldwide audience has brought extraordinary awareness to a disease that is typically overlooked,\" Farber told E! News. \"As a result of her encouragement to visit our website, LupusResearch.org, to learn about lupus, our phones have been ringing off the hook and our website traffic has soared.\"\n\nIt looks like Selena has joined a group of celebrities \u2014 including Lena Dunham, Lady Gaga, and Demi Lovato \u2014 who are willing to speak out about their experiences with misunderstood or stigmatized illnesses to help increase funding and awareness.\n\nRelated: This Is How Selena Gomez and Francia Ra\u00edsa Met", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bc3f77d93fb96940a84a4e/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/selena%252520francia.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d04fb93082d3a2b271d602b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1030171358.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d05343029cbad14799097dc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/promo-image-selena-gomez-style.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d1605b9e93d770008cfefe8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-ud-lizzo.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d03b836c546b633a1b2010c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-aaron-philip.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d0690a79025a7eb8cc9a6ca/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/hero.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bc4606994165653114af54/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d03e42ccbf906a6517c4b12/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Celeb%2520Fash%2520Roundup_6.14_Story.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bc4606994165653114af54/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kara Nesvig", "Tatum Dooley", "Lauren Rearick", "Molly Hora", "De Elizabeth"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-helped-raise-nearly-500000-dollars-for-lupus-research", "title": "Selena Gomez Has Helped Raise Nearly $500,000 for Lupus Research", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Selena Gomez is credited with helping to raise almost $500,000 for Lupus research through a combination of ticket sales donations and calls to action.", "keywords": "SND,Selena Gomez,lupus", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "A major call to action.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bc4606994165653114af54/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Selena Gomez Had a MAJOR Impact on Lupus Fundraising Efforts", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-helped-raise-nearly-500000-dollars-for-lupus-research"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A major call to action.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bc4606994165653114af54/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Selena Gomez Had a MAJOR Impact on Lupus Fundraising Efforts"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311, "admins": 108943}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
