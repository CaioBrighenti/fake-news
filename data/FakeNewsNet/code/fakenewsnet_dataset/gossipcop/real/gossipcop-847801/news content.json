Teen Mom 2 star Kailyn Lowry\u2018s third baby daddy Chris Lopez has remained one of the biggest mysteries in Kail\u2019s life ever since she confirmed that he was the father of her son Lux last year. Chris has refused to film on the hit MTV reality TV series, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he is exempt from getting backlash from Teen Mom 2 fans. Now, Lux\u2019s dad took to Twitter to open up about how he feels about the way he\u2019s perceived by fans of the show.\n\n\u201cThe way people view me is terrible,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI really enjoyed when y\u2019all didn\u2019t know who I was. I could tweet in peace.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chris3zero2/status/1028306942593314816\n\nTeen Mom 2 fans flooded Chris\u2019 mentions, and they all seem to think that it\u2019s his baby mama\u2019s fault for portraying him as a deadbeat \u201cInstagram dad\u201d on the show, because that\u2019s how fans see him now. \u201cYou can thank your BM for that one. She trashed you to look like she\u2019s the ultimate \u2018single mother,'\u201d one fan wrote, while another commented, \u201cYou can kindly thank [Kail] for that we view you like she has portrayed you.\u201d\n\nSince Chris does not film with MTV, he doesn\u2019t get a chance to show his side of the story, so the only way fans learn anything about Chris and his involvement with his son Lux is through Kail. But despite the fact that Kail has said that Chris is not really there as a parent, they still decided to have a joint birthday party for Lux for his first birthday and Chris and Kail seemed to get along at the party for the sake of their son. They even posed together for the first-ever family photo while Lux enjoyed his first slice of birthday cake.\n\nLove Teen Mom?
