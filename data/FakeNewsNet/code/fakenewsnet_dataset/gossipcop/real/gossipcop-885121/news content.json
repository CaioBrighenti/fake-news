Bravo has released the first trailer for the Garden State franchise's eighth season, set to premiere in October, and while it features the return of OG Danielle Staub, this time Teresa Giudice is flipping furniture at resident troublemaker and Posche boutique owner Kim DePaola, aka Kim D.\n\n\u201cYou know what Posche stands for?\" Teresa screams at Kim D. before flipping a chair in her direction. \"Piece Of S--- Coke-whore Home-wrecker Every Day.\" (Anyone still think reality television isn't scripted? Anyone?)\n\nTeresa is apparently furious at Kim D. for spreading rumors that Teresa's husband Joe stepped out on her while Teresa was serving her year-long stint in federal prison for bankruptcy fraud and conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. And while Danielle\u2014back after a five-season absence as a \"friend of the Housewives\"\u2014seems to have reconciled with Teresa over a shared love of yoga (and publicity), she clashes with Dolores Catania, and drinks are flung when she tangles with queen of kumbaya Siggy Flicker. Siggy also has a bone to pick with newcomer Margaret Josephs, a pig-tailed lifestyle expert.\n\nSeason 8 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey will also feature at least one over-the-top soir\u00e9e, a pizza war (Joe Gorga buys a strip-mall pizzeria unbeknownst to wife Melissa), a lavish trip to Italy, a tonnage of false eyelashes, Teresa screeching \"Milania!,\" Danielle showing off the, er, flexibility that earned her 19 marriage proposals, and a return of internecine tensions between Teresa and Melissa (\"She's not a Gorga,\" Teresa tells Joe dismissively at one point. \"She's only a Gorga by marriage.\")\n\nIn quieter moments, Teresa and her family struggle with the death of her mother, Antonia Gorga, who passed away in March at the age of 66, and unresolved issues between Dolores and her ex-husband Frank seem to rise to the surface.\n\nThe 10 Greatest 'Real Housewives' Taglines of All Time Not all taglines are equal. No, many of the Housewife lines have relied on clich\u00e9s, bad puns and worst of all, earnestness. Luckily, these 10 ladies have shown the rest of the pack how it\u2019s done.\n\nRHONJ Season 8 returns Oct. 4 at 9/8c with a 75-minute premiere. And for those suffering from Jersey withdrawal (symptoms: wearing head-to-toe leopard print, a disconcerting craving for sausage), Bravo is also airing a special, The Real Housewives of New Jersey: How They Got Here, Tuesday, Aug. 22, at 9:30/8:30c.\n\nReal Housewives of New Jersey, Season 8 Premiere, Oct. 4, 9/8c, Bravo", "images": ["https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RHONJ_Trailer-1014x570.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner4.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Housewives-copy.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/946102885/?value=1.00&currency_code=USD&label=fOb8CPqJwGYQ5cSRwwM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/logo-tvinsider.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner3.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-sRxQ0qKU4hQu4.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=19587797&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/OnDISH_Mini-Logo.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner6.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo-footer.png", "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/activity/src=9413168;type=invmedia;cat=retar0;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;npa=;ord=1;num=1", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Housewife_Rankings-1014x570.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Untitled-design-146-304x195.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner1-38x32.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner2.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo-white.png"], "top_img": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RHONJ_Trailer-1014x570.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Vicki Hyman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvinsider.com/365402/rhonj-season-8-teresa-giudice-danielle-staub-bravo/", "title": "'Real Housewives of New Jersey' Is Back...and So Is Danielle Staub (VIDEO)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "it2r-MRipevefeCYWkPlW540pNwHDj9JpbST3-LAA-o", "fb": {"pages": 112199118797264, "app_id": 2128917200700396}, "og": {"site_name": "TV Insider", "description": "Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Siggy Flicker, and Delores Cantania welcome back an old friend -- and potential new foe.", "url": "https://www.tvinsider.com/365402/rhonj-season-8-teresa-giudice-danielle-staub-bravo/", "title": "'Real Housewives of New Jersey' Is Back...and So Is Danielle Staub (VIDEO)", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RHONJ_Trailer-1014x570.png", "width": 1014, "height": 570, "alt": "Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 8"}}, "title": "'Real Housewives of New Jersey' Is Back...and So Is Danielle Staub (VIDEO)", "description": "Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Siggy Flicker, and Delores Cantania welcome back an old friend -- and potential new foe.", "twitter": {"site": "@tvinsider", "url": "https://www.tvinsider.com/365402/rhonj-season-8-teresa-giudice-danielle-staub-bravo/", "title": "'Real Housewives of New Jersey' Is Back...and So Is Danielle Staub (VIDEO)", "creator": "@tvinsider", "description": "Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Siggy Flicker, and Delores Cantania welcome back an old friend -- and potential new foe.", "image": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/RHONJ_Trailer-1014x570.png?386", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.tvinsider.com", "summary": ""}
