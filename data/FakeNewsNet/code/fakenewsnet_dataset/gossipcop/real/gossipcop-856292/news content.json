Teams from Industrial Light & Magic, Lucasfilm\u2019s visual-effects division, were videoconferencing in from London, San Francisco, and Vancouver. On a big screen, Poe Dameron, Isaac\u2019s heroic X-wing fighter pilot, was back in action, coaching a gunner named Paige, a new character played by a Vietnamese actress named Veronica Ngo. Another scene featured General Hux, the nefarious First Order commander played with spittle-flecked relish by Domhnall Gleeson. Johnson loved what he was seeing but noted the presence of some \u201cschmutz\u201d\u2014smudges around the edges\u2014on the starcraft window that Hux was looking out of. \u201cI don\u2019t know, does the First Order not keep its windows clean?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you guys play it that way before?\u201d He raised the question more deferentially than critically (and Ben Morris, the movie\u2019s London-based VFX supervisor, said it would be no problem to de-schmutzify the pane). Until The Last Jedi, Johnson had never overseen a picture with a budget above $30 million. But the director betrayed no sign of being overwhelmed. He is a gifted filmmaker whose previous movies, especially Brick (his 2005 debut) and Looper, are visually distinctive and intricately plotted, the assured work of a cinema-drunk U.S.C. film-school grad who, in preparation for Episode VIII, steeped himself in World War II movies like Henry King\u2019s Twelve O\u2019Clock High and \u201cfunky 60s samurai stuff\u201d like Kihachi Okamoto\u2019s Kill! and Hideo Gosha\u2019s Three Outlaw Samurai.

The anointment of Johnson as Episode VIII\u2019s overseer is emblematic of the direction in which Kathleen Kennedy has taken Lucasfilm since she assumed the presidency of the company, in 2012, the same year that George Lucas, who had personally recruited her to take his place, sold the company to Disney. Though she reached out to Abrams, a proven wrangler of blockbuster series (Mission: Impossible, Star Trek), to initiate the current Star Wars trilogy, Kennedy has since picked filmmakers whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are less important than whether or not she is a fan of their work. Kennedy cut her teeth as a Steven Spielberg prot\u00e9g\u00e9e\u2014in the early 80s, when she was not yet out of her 20s, he entrusted her with producing E.T.\u2014and now she, too, is keen on giving relative unknowns their big chance. Johnson was someone she\u2019d had her eye on for years, she told me, admiring \u201chow deliberate he is in his storytelling and the way he moves the camera.\u201d The final film of the trilogy, due in 2019 and for the moment assigned the simple working title Episode IX, will be directed by Colin Trevorrow, who did not yet have the big-budget feature Jurassic World under his belt when he crossed Kennedy\u2019s radar; he came to her attention via his first feature, the 2012 indie comedy Safety Not Guaranteed, and a recommendation from her friend Brad Bird, the Pixar auteur.

Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Part of what makes Lucasfilm\u2019s new system work is that Kennedy has set up a formidable support structure for her filmmakers. Upon her arrival, she put together a story department at Lucasfilm\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, overseen by Kiri Hart, a development executive and former screenwriter she has long worked with. The story group, which numbers 11 people, maintains the narrative continuity and integrity of all the Star Wars properties that exist across various platforms: animation, video games, novels, comic books, and, most important, movies. \u201cThe whole team reads each draft of the screenplay as it evolves,\u201d Hart explained to me, \u201cand we try, as much as we can, to smooth out anything that isn\u2019t connecting.\u201d What the story group does not do, Hart said, is impose plot-point mandates on the filmmakers. Johnson told me he was surprised at how much leeway he was given to cook up the action of Episode VIII from scratch. \u201cThe pre-set was Episode VII, and that was kind of it,\u201d he said. If anything, Johnson wanted more give-and-take with the Lucasfilm team, so he moved up to San Francisco for about six weeks during his writing process, taking an office two doors down from Hart\u2019s and meeting with the full group twice a week. Among Johnson\u2019s inventions for The Last Jedi are three significant new figures: a \u201cshady character\u201d of unclear allegiances, played by Benicio Del Toro, who goes unnamed in the film but is called DJ by the filmmakers (\u201cYou\u2019ll see\u2014there\u2019s a reason why we call him DJ,\u201d Johnson said); a prominent officer in the Resistance named Vice Admiral Holdo, played by Laura Dern; and a maintenance worker for the Resistance named Rose Tico, who is played by a young actress named Kelly Marie Tran (and who is the sister of Paige, the character I witnessed in the scene with Poe Dameron). Tran\u2019s is the largest new part, and her plotline involves a mission behind enemy lines with Boyega\u2019s Finn, the stormtrooper turned Resistance warrior.

Rose and Finn\u2019s adventure takes them to, among other places, another Johnson innovation: a glittering casino city called Canto Bight, \u201ca Star Wars Monte Carlo\u2013type environment, a little James Bond\u2013ish, a little To Catch a Thief,\u201d the director said. \u201cIt was an interesting challenge, portraying luxury and wealth in this universe.\u201d So much of the Star Wars aesthetic is rooted in sandy desolation and scrapyard blight; it appealed to Johnson to carve out a corner of the galaxy that is the complete opposite. \u201cI was thinking, O.K., let\u2019s go ultra-glamour. Let\u2019s create a playground, basically, for rich assholes,\u201d he said. Canto Bight is also where viewers will get their multi-species fix of gnarled aliens and other grotesque creatures, a comic-relief staple of Star Wars movies since Luke Skywalker first met Han Solo amid the cankerous and snouty inhabitants of the Mos Eisley cantina. The Last Jedi is dark enough as it is, so Johnson has made a point of infusing the movie with levity. \u201cI didn\u2019t want this to be a dirge, a heavy-osity movie,\u201d he said. \u201cSo one thing I\u2019ve tried really hard to do is keep the humor in there, to maintain the feeling, amid all the heavy operatic moments, that you\u2019re on a fun ride.\u201d Memories\n\nFisher and Hamill, with whom she first worked four decades ago. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. IV. Sister Carrie\n\nDaisy Ridley has her own tale to tell of Skellig Michael. Part of the reason she looks so convincingly weary at the conclusion of Episode VII is, she said, \u201cthat I had just vomited. I had adrenal exhaustion, and I was very, very sick.\u201d The second time up the cliff, she was in good health and pleased to be re-united with Hamill. But the overall making of Episode VIII proved more psychologically fraught. \u201cWhen I was doing Episode VII, I was kind of being washed along in a torrent of excitement and unexpectedness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we came around to do the next one, it was a bit more scary, because I knew the expectations, and I understood more what Star Wars means to people. It felt like more of a responsibility.\u201d The conflation of real-life and character narratives is not lost on Hamill. Fortunately for Ridley, she had become acquainted with a woman who knew a thing or two about such issues. There was no human being on earth better equipped to shepherd Ridley through what she was experiencing, as both the star of a movie franchise and a feminist model to young girls, than Carrie Fisher. \u201cCarrie lived her life the way she wanted to, never apologizing for anything, which is something I\u2019m still learning,\u201d Ridley said. \u201c \u2018Embarrassed\u2019 is the wrong word, but there were times through it all when I felt like I was \u2026 shrinking. And she told me never to shrink away from it\u2014that it should be enjoyed.\u201d This is a common refrain among the new generation of Star Wars actors: that Fisher was the one who taught them how to deal. Boyega recalled that when there was a backlash against his appearance in the first Force Awakens teaser trailer, released in November 2014\u2014the sight of a black man in stormtrooper armor drew ire from racists and doctrinaire Star Wars traditionalists\u2014Fisher counseled him not to take it to heart. \u201cI remember\u2014and forgive me, I\u2019m going to drop the f-bomb, but that\u2019s just Carrie\u2014she said, \u2018Ah, boohoo, who fuckin\u2019 cares? You just do you,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWords like that give you strength. I bore witness in a million ways to her sharing her wisdom with Daisy too.\u201d Rookies\n\nLaura Dern, as Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a newcomer to the saga. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Fisher had a bigger role to play in The Last Jedi\u2014General Leia Organa logs significantly more screen time in Episode VIII than she did in VII. Isaac, who filmed several scenes with Fisher, said that, like Hamill, she delivered a rich performance, giving her all as an actor, rather than treating Leia\u2019s part as an exercise in feel-good sentimentalism. \u201cWe did this scene where Carrie has to slap me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we did 27 takes in all, and Carrie leaned into it every time, man. She loved hitting me. Rian found such a wonderful way of working with her, and I think she really relished it.\u201d For his part, Johnson quickly formed a deep bond with Fisher as a fellow writer, spending long hours with her at the eccentric compound she shared with her mother, Debbie Reynolds, in the Coldwater Canyon section of Beverly Hills. \u201cAfter I had a draft, I would sit down with her when I was working on re-writing,\u201d he said. \u201cSitting with her on her bed, in her insane bedroom with all this crazy modern art around us, TCM on the TV, a constant stream of Coca-Cola, and Gary the dog slobbering at her feet.\u201d (For visuals on this characteristic state of affairs chez Fisher, I highly recommend Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens\u2019s HBO documentary, Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.) Fisher completed her part in Episode VIII late last summer, when principal photography on the film wrapped. \u201cShe was having a blast,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cThe minute she finished, she grabbed me and said, \u2018I\u2019d better be at the forefront of IX!\u2019 Because Harrison was front and center on VII, and Mark is front and center on VIII. She thought IX would be her movie. And it would have been.\u201d Rookies\n\nBenicio Del Toro, as the shifty \u201cDJ,\u201d a newcomer to the saga. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. When I was conducting the interviews for this story, the Star Wars family was still mourning Fisher\u2019s unexpected death, which occurred on December 27, 2016, four days after she suffered a heart attack on a flight home to Los Angeles from London, and just a day before Reynolds suffered a fatal stroke. (The Star Wars \u201cfamily\u201d includes family in the literal sense: Fisher\u2019s daughter, the actress Billie Lourd, appears as a Resistance lieutenant in both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.) Fisher had celebrated her 60th birthday just two months earlier. \u201cOut of everyone, Carrie was the one I really became friends with and expected to have in my life for years and years,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI last saw her in November, at the birthday party that she threw at her house. In a way, it was the perfect final, encapsulating image of Carrie\u2014receiving all her friends in the bedroom, with Debbie holding court in the living room.\u201d Fisher\u2019s death doesn\u2019t change anything about The Last Jedi except make it more poignant: the film farewell of both the actress and the character. But it does change Episode IX, for which, as Fisher hoped, a central role for Leia had been planned. Kennedy, Trevorrow, and the Lucasfilm team have been compelled to swing from grieving into pragmatic mode, working out how to reconceive the next film in the saga, which is scheduled to start shooting in January. One option that is not on the table is to reanimate Fisher\u2019s Leia via C.G.I., as was briefly done in Rogue One, last year\u2019s stand-alone, non-trilogy Star Wars film, created when she was alive. More extensively in that film, Grand Moff Tarkin, a character played by the late Peter Cushing in the first Star Wars movie, was brought back to life using C.G.I. jiggery-pokery and motion-capture technology that involved the use of an actor who physically resembles Cushing. Plus, Lucasfilm had the Cushing family\u2019s consent. However, said Kennedy, \u201cwe don\u2019t have any intention of beginning a trend of re-creating actors who are gone.\u201d Spawn\n\nAdam Driver, in character as Kylo Ren, Han Solo\u2019s son and slayer, wields a crossguard lightsaber.
