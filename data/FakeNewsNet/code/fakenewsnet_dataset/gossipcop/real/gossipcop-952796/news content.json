Let\u2019s take a closer look\u2026\n\nDoes Olivia Colman look like Queen Elizabeth?\n\nCostume designers may have modelled Olivia Colman\u2019s debut royal outfit from this portrait of Elizabeth II in her office in 1970, titled \u201cRoyal Globetrotter\u201d. Colman looks pretty convincing as the monarch, though if anything her hair isn\u2019t quite tall enough\u2026\n\nPreviously played by: Claire Foy\n\nDoes Tobias Menzies look like Prince Philip?\n\nNetflix revealed its first look at new actor Tobias Menzies in costume as Prince Philip at the end of August 2018. The picture of the real Prince Philip on the left was taken during a formal event in Malta in 1967, which falls right in the time frame for series three. It\u2019s an impressive likeness \u2013 even if Menzies doesn\u2019t quite have the nose to match the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s. The Crown\u2019s costume department have also clearly been closely researching Prince Philip\u2019s weighty collection of medals.\n\nPreviously played by: Matt Smith\n\nDoes Josh O\u2019Connor look like Prince Charles?\n\nYou have to admit, it\u2019s a pretty good likeness! Prince Charles has posed for many awkward photographs in his time and the one on the left marks his 18th birthday, in 1966.\n\nWhen it was announced he was joining the Netflix biopic, O\u2019Connor joked that he did have the \u201cright ears\u201d for the role.\n\nHowever, he has since told RadioTimes.com that this is where the similarities end.\n\n\u201cThe ears is where it stops, really,\u201d he explained. \u201cHopefully I\u2019m not too similar to him. I\u2019m playing a character, I\u2019m not playing real life Prince Charles and hopefully bringing something else to a role in a drama rather than replicating the real man.\u201d\n\nWhile O\u2019Connor is yet to meet the heir to the throne, he joked at the BFI and Radio Times Television Festival that he did have one thing he\u2019d like to do with the prince.\n\n\u201cI would definitely, almost immediately, compare ears, and I would want to know how that\u2019s been for him. I actually would love to know,\u201d he said.\n\nDoes Emerald Fennell look like Camilla Parker Bowles?\n\nWith completely different face shapes and lips, there aren\u2019t many physical similarities between Call the Midwife\u2019s Emerald Fennell and Prince Charles\u2019s love interest (and later second wife) Camilla. But perhaps there\u2019s something in the eyes?\n\nDoes Marion Bailey look like the Queen Mother?\n\nThe Queen Mother was born in 1900 when Victoria was still on the throne. Here she is at the age of 66, to Marion Bailey\u2019s 67 \u2013 and looking at their photographs next to each other, you can see why they cast her.\n\nDoes Helena Bonham Carter look like Princess Margaret?\n\nIn most photographs from this era Princess Margaret can be seen smiling \u2013 but who knows what kind of haughty glares she gave behind closed doors, as we see in this first image of Helena Bonham Carter. Certainly the Queen\u2019s sister loved her eyeliner and lipstick \u2013 and a bit of bling.\n\nPreviously played by: Vanessa Kirby\n\nDoes Ben Daniels look like Tony Armstrong-Jones?\n\nPrincess Margaret\u2019s husband Tony (aka Lord Snowdon) was a society photographer \u2013 and a bit of a rogue. With his piercing blue eyes, you can see why The Crown\u2019s casting director chose Ben Daniels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreviously played by: Matthew Goode", "images": ["https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/Princess-Margaret-in-The-Crown-1ab72b2.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/06/967963720-8e61136.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/TheCrown_206_Unit_00035_R_CROP-f479620.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/06/wimbledon-towels-footer2-39f3372.png?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/08/BeFunky-collage-8-09773f9.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/10/Camilla-and-Emerald-Fennell-f379c1c.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/12/derry-girls-8831a6f.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/08/cropped-radiotimes-header-logo-419324b.png?quality=90&resize=265,54", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/02/olivia-colman-broadchurch-af617d4.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/The-Crown-Josh-OConnor-and-Prince-Charles-45a2543.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/06/97418.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/04/RT-cover-victoria-4506b72.png?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/The-Crown-Marion-Bailey-and-the-Queen-Mother-a9d70ea.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/01/CA522.1-Radio-Times-ER-Guide-Cover-999d568.jpg?quality=90&resize=100,100", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/The-crown-comparison-2-2d8f688.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/Lord-Snowdon-and-Ben-Daniels-in-The-Crown-0fea35a.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/the-queen--6c3fcc9.jpg?quality=90&lb=620,413&background=white"], "top_img": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/The-crown-comparison-2-2d8f688.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eleanor Bley Griffiths"], "canonical_link": "https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-06-23/the-crown-how-similar-real-life-olivia-colman-helena-bonham-carter/", "title": "How similar do the new stars of The Crown look to the real-life royals?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "How similar do The Crown season 3's new stars Olivia Colman, Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Daniels look to the real Queen, Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon?", "og": {"site_name": "Radio Times", "title": "How similar do the new stars of The Crown look to the real-life royals?", "url": "https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-06-23/the-crown-how-similar-real-life-olivia-colman-helena-bonham-carter/", "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2018/07/The-crown-comparison-2-2d8f688.jpg?quality=90&resize=620,413", "description": "Olivia Colman, Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Daniels will star in The Crown series three.
