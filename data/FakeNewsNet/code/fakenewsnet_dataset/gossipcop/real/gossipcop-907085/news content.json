Chrissy Teigen made good on her word that she\u2019d be hosting President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMost Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old model took to Snapchat on Wednesday, January 18, to document the mock event. \u201cJust arrived here at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood,\u201d Teigen narrated a hilarious clip of herself walking around the lobby. \u201cThe Fake News Media Awards are setting up now.\u201d\n\nTeigen then panned the camera around the main floor of the theater, where many people were walking around. \u201cHere at the Dolby Theater for the MDCMAs, the \u2018Most Dishonest and Corrupt Media Awards.\u2019 As you can see, it\u2019s bustling here,\u201d the cookbook author joked. \u201cA lot of people. A lot of people excited for the Fake News Awards. We\u2019re excited!\u201d\n\nThe Lip Sync Battle host then shared a video of herself having her makeup done before the event. \u201cI\u2019m not positive exactly when the awards start. Not sure what time zone,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s happening upstairs but it seems kind of quiet, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nTeigen then posted a video of herself seated in the audience next to several seats reserved for news outlets that have condemned Trump, such as MSNBC and CNN.\n\nAs previously reported, Teigen first joked that she would be attending the event via Twitter on January 3. \u201cExcited to host the red carpet LIVE at \u2018The Most Dishonest and Corrupt Media Awards,\u2019\u201d she wrote at the time. \u201cBe sure to tune in!!\u201d\n\nTeigen\u2019s hilarious post came one day after the commander in chief, 71, confused his followers with a tweet about the show, which will supposedly expose journalists who disagree with him. \u201cI will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o\u2019clock,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cSubjects will cover Dishonest & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned!\u201d\n\nThe hotel magnate gave an update about the event via Twitter on Sunday, January 7, explaining that he has postponed distributing the awards until January 17 given \u201cthe interest in, and importance of, these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated.\u201d\n\nTeigen has been extremely outspoken about her disproval of the real estate mogul in the past. Although Trump has yet to publicly respond to the Cravings author, he blocked her on Twitter in July 2017 after she tweeted at him, \u201cNo one likes you.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chrissy-teigen-live-snaps-from-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chrissy-teigen-live-snaps-from-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chrissy-teigen-live-snaps-from-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/chrissy-teigen-live-snaps-from-fake-media-awards-watch/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Live-Snaps From Fake Media Awards: Watch!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Two weeks after joking that she would be hosting President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards,\u2019 Chrissy Teigen made an appearance at the mock event \u2014 watch!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Live-Snaps From Trump\u2019s Fake Media Awards", "description": "Two weeks after joking that she would be hosting President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards,\u2019 Chrissy Teigen made an appearance at the mock event \u2014 watch!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/chrissy-teigen-live-snaps-from-fake-media-awards-watch/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:02:31+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chrissy-teigen-live-snaps-from-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chrissy-teigen-live-snaps-from-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Chrissy Teigen and Donald Trump"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-01-17T23:56:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:02:31+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Two weeks after joking that she would be hosting President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018Most Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards,\u2019 Chrissy Teigen made an appearance at the mock event \u2014 watch!", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Live-Snaps From Trump\u2019s Fake Media Awards", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chrissy-teigen-live-snaps-from-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516233396.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
