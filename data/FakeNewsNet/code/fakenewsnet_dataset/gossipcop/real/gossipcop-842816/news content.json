What\u2019s going on?\u201d she pleads with the rapper\u2019s friend.\n\nAs the mother of two attempts to comprehend what is happening with her husband, who is on the west coast, her mother, Kris Jenner, and sister, Kourtney Kardashian, sit nearby and remain calm.\n\n\u201cLike, I can\u2019t,\u201d the Kimoji creator says to West\u2019s friend as she wipes away tears from her eyes.\n\nIn November, West was hospitalized for exhaustion and sleep deprivation shortly after he canceled the remaining dates of his Saint Pablo tour, and remained there over the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\n\u201cHe is exhausted and currently dealing with sleep deprivation,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cHe went to the hospital at will under the advice of his physician. He\u2019s fine.\u201d He was discharged from UCLA Medical Center on Nov. 30, where he had been under heavy medical supervision since being admitted on Nov. 21.\n\n\u201cI get a call from one of Kanye\u2019s friends and my heart drops,\u201d Kim explains in the clip. \u201cThey\u2019re not telling me anything and I am so scared and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: Jay-Z & Beyonce: All the Ways J and Bey Get Paid\n\nAt the time of the phone call, Kim was scheduled to attend the Angel Ball in New York City, but did not attend. It would have marked her first public appearance since she was held at gunpoint and robbed of millions of dollars worth of jewelry in Paris in early October. Following news of his hospitalization, she was spotted flying out of New York to head back to Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like crying on the phone to me and he just like wouldn\u2019t say what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Kim explains to her mother and sister. \u201cI\u2019m like \u2018Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she admits.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
