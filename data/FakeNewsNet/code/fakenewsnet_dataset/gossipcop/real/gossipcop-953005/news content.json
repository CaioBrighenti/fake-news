The coin features an image of St. George, the patron saint of England, and a dragon. According to legend, the dragon, who lived nearby St. George\u2019s town, would attack the locals, so St. George, a knight, tamed and killed it. The coin, also embossed with the year 2018, is part of a Royal Mint annual set called The Progress of a Prince.\n\nThe legend of St. George and the dragon has been used on royal coins for centuries, according to the Royal Mint, and deliberately invokes courage and the triumph of good over evil as a tribute to the prince on his birthday. On Prince George\u2019s second birthday, the Royal Mint issued a similar coin. Prince George is third in line to the throne\n\nImage zoom Prince George's 5th birthday commemorative coin The Royal Mint\n\nImage zoom The Progress of a Prince set from the Royal Mint The Royal Mint\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Prince George Wore Pants for the First Time at Royal Wedding (He\u2019s Only Allowed to Wear Shorts!)\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

Just last week, he attended the christening of his little brother, Prince Louis, and stole the show with his big grin in the official portraits. And just a few weeks before, he watched from the sidelines as his dad played in a charity polo at Beaufort Park and attended Trooping the Colour. He was also a page boy at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/prince-george-1.jpg",
