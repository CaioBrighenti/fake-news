"text": "ROYAL aides are said to be concerned over the public outbursts of Meghan Markle\u2019s dad, following a number of explosive TV interviews in recent months.\n\nAccording to the Mirror in the UK, aides at the Palace have held at least three top-level crisis meetings on how to stop Thomas Markle upsetting his daughter.\n\nIt comes after the 74-year-old claimed the Duchess is \u201cterrified\u201d of her new royal role and, royal insiders say, \u201ccrossed the line\u201d with his comments that Princess Diana would have \u201cloathed\u201d how he had been frozen out of the royal circle, reports The Sun.\n\nThe Mirror also claims that the matter has gotten so out of hand that royal sources say the only way to end the farce will be for the Queen to step in.\n\nSources suggest the talks have centred around three potential options to bring the situation to a close.\n\nThe first would be for Meghan to talk directly to her father via a phone call in a personal appeal for him to stop, and a second could be to arrange an intermediary meeting to appeal to him face-to-face.\n\nA final scenario would be to cut him off, the Mirror has claimed.\n\nKensington Palace declined to comment on the claims.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported an unnamed friend of Meghan\u2019s saying that a reconciliation is completely off the table.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no chance right now - he\u2019s been a complete embarrassment,\u201d the source said.\n\nMORE: Thomas Markle speaks about former drug use.\n\nMORE: Meghan\u2019s kids will have surprising surname\n\nThe Palace crisis talks come just days after the Duchess\u2019 dad confessed to taking drugs while his daughter Meghan was growing up.\n\nMeghan\u2019s outspoken father made the startling admission as he angrily denied having a drinking problem.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t do drugs, haven\u2019t for more than 20 years\u201d while claiming he only has wine with dinner.\n\nMr Markle insisted that he doesn\u2019t even drink beer despite being photographed with a six pack.\n\nHe said: \u201cI regularly buy a six-pack for the guys on the guard gate because they\u2019re stuck in a hot shack for hours each day and could use a cold one.\u201d\n\nA source close to the family added that Mr Markle used drugs to cope with the pressures of Hollywood while working as a lighting director.\n\nThey said that drug use was \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of working in television where the hours were long.\n\nWhile Mr Markle did not specify which drugs he used to take, his daughter Samantha said that marijuana was popular among his peers at the time.\n\nThis story was originally published in The Sun and is reprinted here with permission.", "images":
