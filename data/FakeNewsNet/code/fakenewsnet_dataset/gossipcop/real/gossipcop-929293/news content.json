(Gus Ruelas/Reuters)\n\nActress Allison Mack, best known for her decade on TV\u2019s \u201cSmallville,\u201d and Keith Raniere, the leader of what authorities allege is a sex cult, were indicted Friday in New York on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit forced labor, the Albany Times-Union reported.\n\nRaniere and Mack are each charged with multiple counts, and could face a minimum of 15 years in prison. Mack was arrested in New York City on Friday and will be held pending a bail hearing Monday. Raniere has been in custody since he was arrested in Mexico in March.\n\nRaniere is the founder of NXIVM, which bills itself as a self-help and empowerment organization, but is described by authorities as a cultlike group whose members recruited women to be sex slaves, and branded their pubic regions with Raniere\u2019s initials.\n\nThe Rochester Democrat & Chronicle said Mack was indicted \u201cfor her role in DOS, a group \u2026 that purported to be a women\u2019s empowerment sorority. Prosecutors, however, say DOS was actually a sex-slave ring led by Raniere, with women known as \u2018slaves\u2019 who reported to \u2018masters\u2019 who ultimately reported to Raniere himself. Mack is an alleged co-conspirator, reporting directly to Raniere.\u201d\n\nMack, 35, is alleged by prosecutors to have recruited slaves for pay, forcing the women to have sex with Raniere, and using explicit photos and damaging information to ensure their compliance.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, prosecutors said Mack told recruits that they were joining a female mentorship group.\n\n\u201cMack and other \u2026 masters recruited \u2026 slaves by telling them that they were joining a women-only organization that would empower them and eradicate purported weaknesses the NVIVM curriculum taught were common in women,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nBut \u201cthe victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor to the defendants\u2019 benefit,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Moira Kim Penza also said in court that \u201cunder the guise of female empowerment,\u201d Mack \u201cstarved women until they fit her co-defendant\u2019s sexual ideal,\u201d the AP wrote.\n\nMack starred in the CW Network series as Chloe Sullivan from 2001 to 2011, and has been in a handful of television series roles since, according to her IMDB page.\n\nAccording to CBS News:\n\nFormer NXIVM publicist Frank Parlato told Inside Edition that Mack is \u201ccompletely enamored with Raniere and completely under his thrall.\u201d He also said that Mack and her \u201cSmallville\u201d co-star, Kristin Kreuk, were used as \u201cposter girls for normalizing the group.\u201d Kreuk says she left NXIVM years ago and commended the women who exposed DOS.\n\n[Feds say self-help guru coerced followers into sex, had them branded with a cauterizing pen]\n\nRaniere, 57, known to his followers as \u2018the Vanguard\u2019 \u2014 was living in a villa in Puerto Vallarta with several women, according to federal prosecutors, before he was apprehended in March. Mexican authorities took him into custody and delivered him to Texas; he\u2019s now in federal custody in Brooklyn. As Raniere was taken from the villa, The Post\u2019s Kyle Swenson wrote, citing prosecutors, the women chased after authorities in their own car at high speed.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, NXIVM is one of the most extreme groups I have ever dealt with in the sense of how tightly wound it is around the leader,\u201d cult expert Rick Ross told the Times-Union in 2012.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Brooklyn last week wrote in court documents that Rainere has \u201ca decades-long history of abusing women and girls,\u201d and accused him of having sex with minors.\n\nIn a statement attributed to Raniere on NXIVM\u2019s website, he proclaimed his innocence and said he believed the justice system would prevail. He also denied affiliation with DOS, the sorority.\n\nThe Times-Union, however, wrote that \u201cfederal court records indicate emails seized from Raniere\u2019s private messaging accounts support the conclusion that Raniere created the club, which was known as \u2018Dominus Obsequious Sororium,\u2019 which means \u2018Master Over the Slave Women.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nHe dressed as Spider-Man and washed windows at a hospital.
