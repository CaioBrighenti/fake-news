The original three films were written by George C. Johnson, George Nolfi, along with Brian Koppelman and David Levien, for each respective film. Released from 2001 to 2007, the trilogy is often cited as defining its genre and leading to a proliferation and commercialization of heist films throughout the world.[1][2]\n\nBased on the 1960 Rat Pack film, Ocean's 11, the series has seen mixed to favorable critical reception and substantial commercial success. Collectively grossing US$1.17 billion worldwide, the most commercially successful rendition was the first, Ocean's Eleven (2001). It established the ensemble cast of George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt, as Danny Ocean, Linus Caldwell, and Rusty Ryan, respectively. A long list of supporting cast members maintain the trilogy. The first sequel, Ocean's Twelve was released in 2004 with the third and final film, Ocean's Thirteen, following in 2007. An all-female spin-off written and directed by Gary Ross, Ocean's 8 was released on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day after Thirteen's release.\n\nInspiration [ edit ]\n\nThe Ocean's film series was inspired by the 1960 heist film, Ocean's 11, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring five of the Rat Pack: Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Joey Bishop.[3]\n\nOcean's trilogy [ edit ]\n\nOcean's Eleven (2001) [ edit ]\n\nMaster thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney), just out of prison, plans an elaborate Las Vegas three-casino-heist to win back his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts). To that end, he recruits eight other thieves and con men to pull off the complex job, eventually stealing US$160 million.\n\nOcean's Twelve (2004) [ edit ]\n\nThe Ocean's crew is blackmailed by the Casino owner they stole from\u2013Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia)\u2013into paying him $198 million (their loot plus interest). The team is given two weeks to come up with the money so they travel to Europe to execute three heists.\n\nOcean's Thirteen (2007) [ edit ]\n\nOcean and his crew plan to rig a new casino's opening night after its ruthless owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) double crosses one of the gang, with plans to make his life a worthless cesspit of misery, a figurative Tartarus of unending misfortune which needs no explanation apart from a vengeful crew of incredibly skilled thieves.\n\nOcean's 8 (2018) [ edit ]\n\nSoderbergh and George Clooney initially downplayed the possibility of an Ocean's Fourteen or subsequent sequels due to Bernie Mac's death in 2008.[4] However, a new Ocean's Eleven spin-off with an all-female cast led by Sandra Bullock as the sister of George Clooney's Danny Ocean was put in development. It was conceived by producer Jerry Weintraub, Soderbergh and Clooney. Olivia Milch wrote the screenplay, and Gary Ross directed the film.[5][6] Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett and Mindy Kaling were later announced to star in the film.[7] Elizabeth Banks had previously been attached to the project, but a deal between her and Warner Bros. could not be reached.[8]\n\nThe title of the spin-off was later revealed to be Ocean's Eight.[9] In August 2016, Anne Hathaway, Rihanna and Nora \"Awkwafina\" Lum were also confirmed to join the cast.[10] The night after her Emmy win, Sarah Paulson was announced as the final cast member of the titular eight.[11] The film was released in the United States on June 8, 2018.[12]\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nBox office performance [ edit ]\n\nFilm Release date Box office revenue Box office ranking Budget Reference United States Foreign Worldwide All time domestic All time worldwide Ocean's Eleven December 7, 2001 $183,417,150 $267,300,000 $450,717,150 #241 #286 $85 million [13] Ocean's Twelve December 10, 2004 $125,544,280 $237,200,000 $362,744,280 #504 #344 $110 million [14] Ocean's Thirteen June 8, 2007 $117,154,724 $194,157,900 $311,312,624 #567 #441 $85 million [15][16] Ocean's 8 June 8, 2018 $140,218,711 $157,500,000 $297,718,711 #406 #474 $70 million [17] Total $566,334,865 $856,157,900 $1,422,492,765 N/A N/A $350 million [18]\n\nCritical reaction [ edit ]", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean%27s_(film_series)", "title": "Ocean's (film series)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.34.0-wmf.13", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
