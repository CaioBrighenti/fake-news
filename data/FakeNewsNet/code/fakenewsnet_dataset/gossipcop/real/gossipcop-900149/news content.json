Last week, when news reports suggested that the family-friendly Disney had its eye on Fox, Reynolds joked about what a Disney-fied Deadpool might look like.\n\nTime to uncork that explosive sexual tension between Deadpool and Mickey Mouse. https://t.co/iUEXofWpRu \u2014 Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) December 6, 2017\n\nDisney purchased multiple assets from 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion in stock, acquiring all of its film and TV productions, as well as its back catalog of films and shows. The deal also means that the rights to Marvel characters like the X-Men and Deadpool will revert back to Disney\u2019s Marvel Studios, after being owned by Fox for years.\n\nA sequel to 2016\u2019s Deadpool is already in the works, with David Leitch (Atomic Blonde) directing the Merc with a Mouth\u2019s latest outing. Josh Brolin is on board to play Cable, with Zazie Beetz also joining as Domino.\n\nDeadpool 2 will hit theaters June 1, 2018.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jacob-tremblay-awkwafina.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/crl13120r.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b0b5b9b2a4c69c96b6aeb666dcc61d99?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/sm-th_social_8328328328932.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/g3rwef.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/star-wars-galaxys-edge-8.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/toystory45cfbcc7aebe4d.jpg?crop=385px%2C0px%2C3048px%2C1600.2px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/m_08004_rc.jpg?crop=451px%2C219px%2C2249px%2C1181px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mcdfaof_ec021.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/harry-met-sally-4-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C305px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/melissa-ursula.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/000071733hr.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C3429px%2C1800.225px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mulan-a.jpg?crop=540px%2C262px%2C1549px%2C814px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/wiig-dornan-mumulo-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/aviation-gin.jpg?crop=0px%2C100px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/scary-stories.jpg?crop=328px%2C0px%2C2343px%2C1230.075px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/betty-gilpin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/michell-rodriguez-fast-and-furious-6.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/df-09376_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/000245269hr.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-prom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/df-09376_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devan Coggan"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/ryan-reynolds-disney-fox-merger-deadpool-photo/", "title": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "deadpool, deadpool 2, disney fox sale, disneyland", "news_keywords": "deadpool, deadpool 2, disney fox sale, disneyland", "description": "It's only been a few hours since Disney announced that it will buy 21st Century Fox's film and TV divisions,\u2026", "og": {"title": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/ryan-reynolds-disney-fox-merger-deadpool-photo/", "description": "It's only been a few hours since Disney announced that it will buy 21st Century Fox's film and TV divisions,\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/df-09376_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/ryan-reynolds-disney-fox-merger-deadpool-photo/", "description": "It's only been a few hours since Disney announced that it will buy 21st Century Fox's film and TV divisions,\u2026", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/df-09376_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/14/ryan-reynolds-disney-fox-merger-deadpool-photo/", "title": "Ryan Reynolds pokes fun at Disney-Fox merger with Deadpool photo", "description": "It's only been a few hours since Disney announced that it will buy 21st Century Fox's film and TV divisions,\u2026", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/df-09376_rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513227600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
