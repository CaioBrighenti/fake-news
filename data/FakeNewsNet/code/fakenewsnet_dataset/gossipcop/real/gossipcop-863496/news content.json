Wearing shades are a healthy necessity as Ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) eye exposure can lead to vision loss, yet more than 25% do not wear shades when outside.\n\nBrands such as Carrera,Givenchy, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi, Prada, Versace, Tiffany & Co. and many more luxury styles offering 100% Ultraviolet protection for Women, Men and Kids. Ultraviolet damage occurs over a lifetime of exposure so it is important to make sunglasses an \u201coutdoor habit\u201d, regardless of the season.
