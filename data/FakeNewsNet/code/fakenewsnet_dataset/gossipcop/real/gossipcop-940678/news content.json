Watch as they harmonize on the song's soaring chorus and then cap things off with a sweet hug.\n\n\"I love you, Gwen,\" Pink, 38, tells her special guest as Stefani leaves the stage.\n\n\"It just doesn't get better than that. She's my spirit animal,\" she then gushes to the screaming crowd.\n\nLucky fans took to social media to share their own videos from the epic duet. \"The moment when all my childhood dreams came true,\" wrote one.\n\nAfter the show, Pink shared a pic from the performance on Instagram, writing, \"Y'all don't even understand how much love I have for this chick, this rocker, this mama, this entrepreneur, this total OG badass that is @gwenstefani. There really aren't any comparisons as far as I'm concerned. Tonight was fun. Thanks friend.\"\n\nStefani returned the love on her Instagram Story, sharing two short clips of herself having a blast at her buddy's concert.\n\n\"Thank you Pink for having me. I love you. That was awesome,\" she gushed.\n\nNo doubt about it, we want to hear more duets from these two!", "images": ["https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_22/1343274/gwen-stefani-pink-today-tease-180601_77f46f084a2e524ff37e01cce2f7c91a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_22/1343274/gwen-stefani-pink-today-tease-180601_77f46f084a2e524ff37e01cce2f7c91a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/pink-reunites-gwen-stefani-perform-just-girl-t130153", "title": "Pink reunites with Gwen Stefani to perform 'Just a Girl' \u2014 watch the video", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/pink-reunites-gwen-stefani-perform-just-girl-t130153", "title": "Pink reunites with Gwen Stefani to perform 'Just a Girl' \u2014 watch the video", "description": "Pink has performed the No Doubt hit on tour, but she got help from Stefani herself during her recent concert in Los Angeles.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_22/1343274/gwen-stefani-pink-today-tease-180601_77f46f084a2e524ff37e01cce2f7c91a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_22/1343274/gwen-stefani-pink-today-tease-180601_77f46f084a2e524ff37e01cce2f7c91a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_22/1343274/gwen-stefani-pink-today-tease-180601_77f46f084a2e524ff37e01cce2f7c91a.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Pink reunites with Gwen Stefani to perform 'Just a Girl' \u2014 watch the video", "description": "Pink has performed the No Doubt hit on tour, but she got help from Stefani herself during her recent concert in Los Angeles.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Pink has performed the No Doubt hit \"Just a Girl\" on tour, but she got help from Gwen Stefani herself during her recent concert in Los Angeles.", "thumbnail": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_22/1343274/gwen-stefani-pink-today-tease-180601_77f46f084a2e524ff37e01cce2f7c91a.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527889393.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
