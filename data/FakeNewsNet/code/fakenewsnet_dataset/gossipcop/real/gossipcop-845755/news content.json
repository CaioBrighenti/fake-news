I love to have my hair done. A trip to the local blow-dry bar is my favorite Saturday afternoon pastime. However, at $50 a session, getting this look done by professionals on the regular is costly. So I\u2019ve perfected my own blowout skills.\n\nIt may seem like an easy task: grab a blow-dryer, point, and blast with heat. But there is a mastery behind it. And you may be making simple mistakes that are actually hurting your hair even more than your look. Here, top pros break down the science to getting a gorgeous at-home blowout every single time and point out all the rookie mistakes that keep them in business.\n\n1. You don\u2019t have a great blow-dryer.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the very beginning: Investing in a high-quality tool is important, especially if you have a lot of hair or you\u2019re blow-drying your hair often.\n\n\u201cIf you have thick hair, you\u2019re probably damaging your hair more with a cheap blow-dryer as opposed to investing in a great one that will protect your hair and blow-dry it quicker,\u201d K\u00e9rastase celebrity stylist Jennifer Yepez tells SELF. Expensive dryers tend to come with hair-saving smart features like high power, multiple heat settings, a cool shot, and ionic air technology. The last one helps with frizz, creates shine, and minimizes blow-dry time. \u201cThe technology in ionic hair dryers helps break down water molecules faster, which makes the hair dry faster,\u201d she adds. The less time your hair is under heat and the more control you have over the temperature, the healthier it will be.\n\nYepez\u2019s favorites are the new T3 Cura Luxe ($250) and the Dyson Supersonic ($399). Expensive? Yes, but you\u2019ll pay for it in what you save skipping just five to 10 blowouts at the salon\u2014and they\u2019ll last you years.\n\n2. You\u2019re spending too long with your hair wrapped in a towel.\n\n\u201cAfter getting out of the shower, women tend to leave their hair in the towel for like 30 minutes,\u201d says Giovanni Vaccaro, Glasmsquad\u2019s creative director. \u201cA cotton-based towel causes friction on the hair, and it's more prone to damaging the strands to the point where the hair breaks off,\u201d he explains.\n\nIf you want to get rid of excess water, Vaccaro recommends using a microfiber towel like the Aquis or an old, clean t-shirt. And still, only spend about 10 minutes with your head wrapped up post-shampoo.\n\nThe best thing for your hair\u2019s health is actually letting it air-dry before blow-drying. \u201cHair is in its most vulnerable state when wet, so allowing it to air-dry is always the healthiest option,\u201d explains Vaccaro.\n\nMake sure to dry your hair according to your texture. Vaccaro says that fine-to-medium hair can air-dry a bit longer, to about 80 percent dryness, whereas thicker hair should only be about 50 percent dry before blow-drying. That\u2019s because you have a better chance of getting curly or full hair straight while it\u2019s still a little damp.\n\nIf you have curly or wavy hair and want to enhance your natural texture, add product when it\u2019s very wet, squeeze out the excess with your hands, and wrap it up gently in a microfiber towel or t-shirt. Once your curls stop dripping, you can start blow-drying.\n\n3. You start in with the brush too soon.\n\nOn the opposite side of the 30-minute towel turban faux paus is taking a round brush to sopping wet hair. It\u2019s bad form to immediately walk out of the shower and pick up your blow-dryer and round brush for a blowout. T3 celebrity stylist David Lopez suggests using a dryer to rough dry hair first. Set it to medium heat and low speed. \u201cIf hair is very wet and put on high speed, then it gets whipped around a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cThis can cause split ends, tangles, and frizz.\u201d Once hair is about 80 percent dry from the rough dry, then you can start sectioning it, molding it, and styling it with a round brush.\n\n4. You forget to spray heat protectant on the back of your head.\n\nUsing the right product pre-blowout is going to save your ends from breakage and make your blowout last longer. But make sure you\u2019re applying it correctly.\n\n\u201cWhen some people use a serum for frizzy hair or a thickening spray for volume, they just spray the top of their hair, instead of all around,\u201d says Yepez. \u201cSometimes you just forget the back of your hair.\u201d\n\nShe advises parting the hair, creating sections, and working the product from mid-shaft to ends. You can also comb it through, but Yepez says she\u2019s often in a hurry and just uses her fingers.\n\n5. You ignore the concentrator nozzle attachment.\n\nYou know that flat, nozzle thing that attaches to the end of your hair dryer? Don\u2019t lose it! That little nozzle helps concentrate the air in a more precise way and protect hair from excess heat, which is better for hair health and styling.\n\n\u201cA nozzle is a must for a smooth finish!\u201d Vaccaro adds. \u201cThe nozzle provides distance between the hair and the lip of the dryer, which is the hottest point. Additionally, the nozzle keeps the air flow concentrated, and without it, the hot air disperses, causing undesirable frizz.\u201d\n\nEven if you\u2019re not going for a sleek style, it is important to attach the nozzle\u2014no matter how lazy you feel. \u201cIf you're just a \u2018rough dry and go\u2019 girl, you should still utilize the smoothing capabilities of the concentrator,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cIt helps streamline the airflow leading to less tangles and split ends.\u201d That means fewer haircuts, ladies.\n\nNot all nozzles are created equal. \u201cLook for thinner nozzles\u2014that way, it\u2019s more direct,\u201d says Yepez. The thinner nozzle will help blast hot air directly to the roots and get more volume in your styles.\n\n6. You\u2019re using the wrong brush.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing a brush, the type you use should depend on the results you\u2019re looking for and your hair type. Typically a round brush is the stylist favorite for a voluminous, bouncy look. But you have choices when it comes to the material of the bristles. \u201cFor women with straight hair who want movement, ceramics are fantastic,\u201d says Vaccaro. \u201cFor women who want smoothness but have coarse, frizzy hair, boar bristle is key to provide the right amount of tension needed to achieve that smoothness.\u201d\n\nYepez adds that she favors brushes with ceramic-coated barrels (such as this T3 one ) since it heats up to dry hair faster. \u201cIf you have curly hair or need extra shine, it will get your hair to blow-dry quicker,\u201d she says. For volume and lift in the roots, she recommends the YS Park G Series Curl Shine Styler Round Brush ($80). \u201cThis brush is the perfect size for any hair type,\u201d she says. \u201cThe bristles are specially made to help with faster drying and less heat damage .\u201d\n\n7. You start drying from the back of the head.\n\nAccording to both Lopez and Vaccaro, many women make the mistake of starting their blowout from the back of the hair. It\u2019s better to start at the temples, hairline, and crown then move backwards to the nape. That way you tackle the most visible parts first.\n\n\u201cUsually you start in the back, and by the time you get to the top and hairline, your hair has dried making it harder to get smooth,\u201dsays Lopez.\n\nAnd if you have bangs, we\u2019re definitely talking to you. \u201cThe front of hair tends to be the most challenging to smooth\u2014think cowlicks and short wisps\u2014and is also the most visible part of your style,\u201d notes Vaccaro. \u201cBy starting from the back, your hairline is bound to get frizzy, so get the tough part done first.\u201d\n\n8. You want volume, but don\u2019t give your roots extra attention.\n\nLifting from the roots is key if you want more volume. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a lot of time or you\u2019re not a professional and you want volume, a great tip is to flip the hair upside down and brush it so that your roots are going the opposite direction,\u201d says Yepez. Do this while adding a final blast of heat with the blow-dryer. You can also use a wide-tooth comb or your hands.\n\nIf you want extra volume at the crown, you can set the top of the head with larger rollers. Put in the rollers while the hair is still warm from the blow-dryer. \u201cPin it up with a bobby pin, and let it cool,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo you get the most full volume and a nice wave.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5c118341f52edf5a5c329766/4:3/h_130/woman-with-ponytail-and-headphones.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a946210fb42c00245b6b7da/4:3/w_728,c_limit/blowdrying-hair-mistakes.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5aa03fdc2a1b7629bd42d412/4:3/h_130/beauty-products.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ac78a55811fd16eba758b3c/4:3/h_130/IMG_6687.JPG", "https://collector-PX69t0oUvr.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX69t0oUvr", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a946210fb42c00245b6b7da/2:1/pass/blowdrying-hair-mistakes.jpg", "https://www.self.com/images/self-starter-failsafe.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5a946210fb42c00245b6b7da/2:1/pass/blowdrying-hair-mistakes.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Levinson", "March"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/blow-dry-mistakes", "title": "8 Mistakes You're Making When You Blow-Dry Your Hair", "meta_data": {"generator": "autopilot-build-Sat Jul 13 2019 10:48:01 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "Lauren Levinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond&#233; Nast 2019", "description": "Want to get salon-level blowout results at home when you blow-dry your hair?
