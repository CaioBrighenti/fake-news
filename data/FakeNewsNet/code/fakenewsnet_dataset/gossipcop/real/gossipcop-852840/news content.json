We\u2019re really excited to see Tom Holland star as our favorite webslinger in Spider-Man: Homecoming, out later this summer. But while anticipating is growing (particularly among fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe), some people aren\u2019t as thrilled about the reboots. Actress Kirsten Dunst recently spoke out about the upcoming reboots, and odds are she won\u2019t be nabbing tickets for opening weekend.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t recall, Kirsten Dunst starred alongside Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy. She played Mary Jane Watson, a role that doesn\u2019t appear in this reboot (Zendaya will be starring as a character known only as \u201cMichelle\u201d). In a recent interview with Marie Claire UK, Kirsten Dunst spoke at length about a number of topics. Everything from social media to childcare was addressed. And during the interview, Dunst made her stance on the new films exceedingly clear.\n\n\"We made the best ones, so who cares? I\u2019m like, \u2018You make it all you want.\u2019 They\u2019re just milking that cow for money. It\u2019s so obvious. You know what I mean?\u201d\n\nWe get where Kirsten Dunst is coming from (after all, she did star in the original Spider-Man trilogy), but that seems a bit harsh. After all, Andrew Garfield was a more than worthy follow-up to Tobey Maguire, and Tom Holland has already shown his considerable chops as Spidey in Captain America: Civil War. So while she may be down about the reboots, we\u2019re still really looking forward to seeing what Holland and Marvel Studios whip up for the wisecracking webslinger.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09101322/Ariana-Grande-in-My-head-Video.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/24163228/megantheestallion.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/07114801/alwaysbemymaybe.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/12130629/latenight-mindykaling.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/14070645/lili-reinhart-chemical-hearts-e1560521229941.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/06133019/satc1.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/30045435/cersei.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/03161937/friends-e1543882785629.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/30152125/do-the-right-thing.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/14204711/whitneyhouston.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01111121/Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072542/avatar-g-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/30103604/all-that-sketches.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09090218/gordon-e1562688256883.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/30100325/nsync1-e1525107823744.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/18091714/Zendaya1.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28102729/Yung-Baby-Tate.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/01073532/spider-man.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01095706/melissa-mccarthy-e1562000253438.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/24081819/Beyonce-Coachella.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02073323/Alison-Mack-NXIVM-Sex-Cult.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28083732/One-Day-at-a-Time.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/01073532/spider-man.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Saccone"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/kirsten-dunst-continues-strong-opinions-spider-man-reboots/", "title": "Kirsten Dunst continues to have strong opinions on these \"Spider-Man\" reboots", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kirsten dunst,spider-man,spiderman", "news_keywords": "kirsten dunst,spider-man,spiderman", "description": "Kirsten Dunst told \"Marie Claire\" that she thinks these new Spider-Man reboots are just a cash grab and has other strong opinions on the subject.", "og": {"title": "Kirsten Dunst continues to have strong opinions on these \"Spider-Man\" reboots", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/kirsten-dunst-continues-strong-opinions-spider-man-reboots/", "description": "The actress has a decidedly strong stance on the new \"Spider-Man.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/01073532/spider-man.jpg", "width": 540, "height": 960}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/kirsten-dunst-continues-strong-opinions-spider-man-reboots/", "description": "Kirsten Dunst told \"Marie Claire\" that she thinks these new Spider-Man reboots are just a cash grab and has other strong opinions on the subject.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/01073532/spider-man.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/kirsten-dunst-continues-strong-opinions-spider-man-reboots/", "title": "Kirsten Dunst continues to have strong opinions on these \"Spider-Man\" reboots", "description": "The actress has a decidedly strong stance on the new \"Spider-Man.\"", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/01073532/spider-man.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
