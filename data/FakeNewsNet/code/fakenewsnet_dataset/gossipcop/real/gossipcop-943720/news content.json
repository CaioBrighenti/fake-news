Between the custom costumes, the adorable family photos and the revelation that the couple may have renewed their wedding vows, the Bey Hive has not stopped buzzing.\n\nIn an adorable family montage, the couple of 10 years shared a rare glimpse of their 11-month-old twins Rumi and Sir while all dressed in all white. And we just got further proof that it appeared to be a vow renewal ceremony, because a press release on behalf of designer Galia Lahav confirmed that Beyonc\u00e9 was wearing the couture label\u2019s \u201cThelma\u201d style wedding dress for a \u201cvow renewal.\u201d\n\nGalia Lahav announced that she wore a gown from the \u201cVictorian Affinity\u201d collection, which paid homage to Queen Victoria\u2019s wedding dress through the corseted bodice, Chantilly lace and the Victorian bustle train details on the gown. This version incorporated modern elements such as sheer cutouts, an off-the-shoulder neckline and Swarovski crystals and pearls adornments.\n\nIn the video above, you can see the gown from every angle.\n\nRELATED: All the Details on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s On the Run II Opening Look, According to Designer LaQuan Smith\n\nImage zoom Raven Varona/Parkwood/PictureGroup\n\nOn Thursday, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mother Tina Knowles Lawson shared a screen shot of the video of Sir, Rumi, Blue and their parents writing on Instagram, \u201cMy babies\u2764\u2764\u2764.\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 & JAY-Z renewed their vows together with Blue and The Twins \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udc99#OTRII #Cardiff pic.twitter.com/MlPnV8lo0L \u2014 On The Run II (@OTRIITour) June 6, 2018\n\nTina Knowles Instagram confirmed the twins in that photo were in fact Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s, after the pair shared a photo holding another set of twins at one point throughout their show, causing slight confusion with fans.\n\nBeyonce Says About Blue Ivy: \u201cShe Introduced Me to Myself\u201d\n\nDuring the show a photo of the pair holding two babies was shared along with the words \u201cLOVE IS UNIVERSAL\u201d and \u201cLOVE NEVER CHANGES.\u201d Many thought the children were Rumi and Sir, but a source told PEOPLE they were not.\n\nRumi and Sir Carter debut on #OTRII! pic.twitter.com/k66EgzzE1Y \u2014 B\u03a3Y\u03a6NC\u03a3 HUB (@theyoncehub) June 6, 2018\n\n\u201cAt the end of the show the Carter babies were included in a family collage [however] the babies in the film clip at the beginning were not their children,\u201d a source said.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z wed in 2008, and for their first ceremony, Beyonc\u00e9 wore a gown designed by her mother. Though, she later revealed that she was not so \u201ccrazy in love\u201d with it, but never let her mother know!\n\nIn 2016, Lawson talked about the dress on the Today Show. \u201cShe was so sweet to let me do that. She came back later one day and she said, \u2018You know, when my daughter gets married, I\u2019m going to let her pick out her own dress.\u2019 Maybe she wasn\u2019t so excited about it at the time, but she\u2019s a sweetheart.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/684440673e7de9e6288f8fd2fb40dc8a?s=300&d=blank&r=g",
