The lineup will then be repeated the following weekend.\n\nFrom biting to lift-gate: why do so many obsessive rumours swirl around Beyonc\u00e9? Read more\n\nLast year, the festival expanded substantially to accommodate a seventh stage after local authorities approved a plan upping the festival acreage from 601 to 642 and its capacity from 99,000 to 125,000. Dirt roads were replaced with boardwalks and palm-tree-lined walkways, and a higher influx of hip-hop acts, including Kendrick Lamar, Future and Gucci Mane, packed the schedule.\n\nThis year will see Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first major performance since giving birth to twins last June, and she\u2019s apparently been rehearsing through 11-hour days in preparation. The star recently announced dates with Jay-Z for their On The Run II tour, kicking off in Cleveland this summer, leading many to believe the singer\u2019s husband will be making a surprise cameo at the festival. Major, unannounced guest spots are a time-honored tradition: last year, Drake, Pharrell and Lauryn Hill all showed up to assist.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 recently posted a teasing image of herself with dancers on Instagram (her set will reportedly feature at least 100 of them). \u201c[Her Coachella performance is] going to change the game,\u201d the star\u2019s lead choreographer, JaQuel Knight, said in December. \u201cBe ready for a good time. A good ol\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nThe Weeknd, whose surprise My Dear Melancholy EP is his third US No 1 in a row, is headlining on Friday night while Eminem will take the reins on Sunday. The rapper posted an energetic video of his rehearsal earlier this week.\n\n\n\nIt will mark his first appearance at Coachella since 2012, when he appeared alongside Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a hologram of Tupac to close out the festival. With the release of his ninth studio album, Revival, he\u2019s become one of hip-hop\u2019s most vocal critics of Donald Trump, with further jabs at the president expected on Sunday.\n\nHis set will follow on from Cardi B, whose debut album, Invasion of Privacy, met with a string of rave reviews when it was launched this month. She revealed to the radio show Hip Hop Nation that she was spending nearly $300,000 on her stage set. \u201cI have to invest so much money on my stage set \u2013 my own money that I gotta go to Wells Fargo and write a check,\u201d she said.\n\nThe festival will also see sets from Tyler, the Creator; Miguel; Haim; David Byrne; SZA; Fleet Foxes; and Jamiroquai. The first weekend\u2019s major performances will also be live-streamed on the festival\u2019s YouTube channel.", "images":
