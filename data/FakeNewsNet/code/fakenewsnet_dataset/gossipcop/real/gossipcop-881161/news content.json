The most recent staff change on the talk show comes in the form of Meghan McCain.\n\nAccording to Variety, the daughter of Sen. John McCain will take over as host of the ABC daytime program from Jedediah Bila, who announced her departure last week. McCain is expected to start regularly co-hosting in October, alongside Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sara Haines, Paula Faris and Sunny Hostin. The 32-year-old announced her exit from Fox News\u2019s \u201cOutnumbered,\u201d which she had co-hosted since November, on Sept. 15, stating that she was \u201cleaving to focus on other things.\u201d Turns out that one of those \u201cother things\u201d was \u201cThe View.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so thankful to @FoxNews for the chance to be on @OutnumberedFNC but I\u2019m leaving to focus on other things, I have no doubt the show will \u2014 Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) September 15, 2017\n\nMcCain is the most recent in a trail of co-hosts who have come and gone since Barbara Walters, the show\u2019s creator, retired in 2014. Previous hosts since then have included Sherri Shepherd, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Nicolle Wallace, Rosie Perez, Jenny McCarthy, Raven-Symone, Michelle Collins, Candace Cameron Bure and Bila.\n\nBila announced her resignation from the show a few days after Hillary Clinton came on to promote her new book, \u201cWhat Happened.\u201d Bila asked the former presidential candidate a tough question and referred to her as \u201ctone deaf,\u201d inspiring conspiracy theories that ABC had fired the host over the exchange.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of staff who were upset about how that interview was handled,\u201d a source told Page Six. \u201cThey had a lot to say to Jedediah about calming things down.\u201d Show reps denied that Bila was asked to leave as a result of the interview, claiming that \u201cshe left on her own accord.\u201d\n\nMcCain will replace Bila as the conservative member of the panel, but she isn\u2019t necessarily team Trump. She criticized the president on Twitter after reports surfaced that he was physically mocking her dad. In a Tweet on Wednesday, McCain, referring to her father\u2019s recent brain cancer diagnosis, wrote: \u201cWhat more must my family be put through right now?
