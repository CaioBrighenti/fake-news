(TMG has countersued.)\n\nThings didn't get any better for Depp on Wednesday when The Hollywood Reporter published a feature that went deeper into Depp's financial woes.\n\nTMG's Joel Mandel claims that even though Depp has earned more than $650 million in the more than 13 years the company represented the star, Depp didn't have enough cash to cover his $2 million in bills each month.\n\nDepp's extravagant spending habits reportedly include $3.6 million annually for his 40-person staff, $350,000 monthly for maintaining his 156-foot yacht, $30,000 monthly for wine, and $5 million the star says he spent to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.\n\nTMG says it met with Depp numerous times over the years to try to get Depp to sell some of his expensive items. On one occasion, he agreed to sell his $10 million yacht that he spent $8 million to renovate, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Another year, TMG almost got Depp to sell his French chateau \u2014 on which he spent $10 million to renovate \u2014 but he got cold feet after prospective buyers came calling, according to the former business managers, and it has since been relisted for $39 million.\n\nJohnny Depp will be seen next in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" out May 26. Disney Depp has routinely earned $20 million up-front paychecks for the movies he's been in since the success of 2003's \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl.\" He also gets 20% of the backend per picture, according to The Hollywood Reporter \u2014 a source said that was $40 million from the backend of each \"Pirates\" movie and $55 million from his profit on the 2010 hit \"Alice in Wonderland,\" which earned over $1 billion worldwide.\n\nTMG attorney Michael Kump said in the lawsuit that TMG stepped in to help Depp avert a \"devastating financial collapse.\" Depp has claimed he was kept in the dark about his finances.\n\nIt's unclear how cash-strapped Depp is. According to litigation, he has received $25.7 million over the past two years in profits from six movies, and he earned up-front money \u2014 likely close to $20 million each \u2014 from \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" \"LAbyrinth,\" and \"Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes.\"\n\nA representative for Depp did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59134ad1d9f40621008b52c2-750-562.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59134adcd9f40620008b52ce-1136-568.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59134adcd9f40620008b52ce-1136-568.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Guerrasio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/johnny-depp-spending-habits-financial-trouble-2017-5", "title": "Johnny Depp made $650 million but couldn't pay for his lavish lifestyle, ex-manager says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-05-10", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-10", "news_keywords": "People, Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spending, Jason Guerrasio", "sailthru.tags": "People, Johnny Depp, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spending, Jason Guerrasio", "description": "Johnny Depp makes about $20 million for every movie he stars in, but he reportedly has had trouble covering spending habits of $2 million a month.", "sailthru.description": "Johnny Depp makes about $20 million for every movie he stars in, but he reportedly has had trouble covering spending habits of $2 million a month.", "title": "Johnny Depp made $650 million but couldn't pay for his lavish lifestyle, ex-manager says", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire, clusterstock, law, thelife", "sailthru.title": "Johnny Depp made $650 million but couldn't pay for his lavish lifestyle, ex-manager says", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59134adcd9f40620008b52ce-1136-568.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59134ad1d9f40621008b52c2-960-720.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59134ad1d9f40621008b52c2-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "sailthru.author": "Jason Guerrasio", "og": {"title": "Johnny Depp made $650 million but couldn't pay for his lavish lifestyle, ex-manager says", "description": "Johnny Depp makes about $20 million for every movie he stars in, but he reportedly has had trouble covering spending habits of $2 million a month.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/johnny-depp-spending-habits-financial-trouble-2017-5", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59134adcd9f40620008b52ce-1136-568.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Jason Guerrasio", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/johnny-depp-spending-habits-financial-trouble-2017-5", "title": "Johnny Depp made $650 million but couldn't pay for his lavish lifestyle, ex-manager says", "description": "Johnny Depp makes about $20 million for every movie he stars in, but he reportedly has had trouble covering spending habits of $2 million a month.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59134adcd9f40620008b52ce-1136-568.jpg", "creator": "@JasonGuerrasio", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "Johnny Depp made $650 million but couldn't pay for his lavish lifestyle, ex-manager says": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494388800.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
