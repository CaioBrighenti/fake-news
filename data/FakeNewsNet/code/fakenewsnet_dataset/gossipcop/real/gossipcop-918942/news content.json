Lee recently got into a physical altercation with his son Brandon.\n\nTensions are flying high between Tommy Lee and his son Brandon.\n\nAccording to TMZ, a physical altercation allegedly broke out between Lee and his 21-year-old son last night. No arrests were made, however Lee was transported to a nearby hospital after his son allegedly gave him a fat lip.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Fire Department confirms to E! News that they did in fact respond to Lee's Calabasas home at roughly 10:50 p.m. last evening for an assault call.\n\nLee posted a photo of his bleeding face on social media, writing, \"My heart is broken. You can give your kids everything they could ever want in their entire lives and they can still turn against you. Good job Brandon! Great son!\" The post has since been deleted.\n\nPamela Anderson's Playboy Covers\n\nBrandon, who is the son of Lee and Pamela Anderson, told TMZ that his father was drunk and that he punched him in self-defense.\n\nBut in a tweet posted by Lee in response to the allegations, the musician gives new details on his side of the story, writing, \"Hey @TMZ maybe get your facts straight before you go reporting bullshit. My fiance and I were in bed when my son busted into the room and assaulted me. I asked him to leave the house and he knocked me unconscious. He ran away from the police. THAT'S the truth.\"\n\nThe incident comes less than 24 hours after Lee took to social media over an interview his ex-wife, Anderson, recently did with Piers Morgan. In the interview, Anderson stated that Lee has been abusive during their relationship.\n\n\"Think she'd find something new to discuss instead of rehashing old s--t,\" he wrote.\n\nE! News has reached out to Lee's rep for comment.\n\n5 Things You May Not Know About Tom Holland\n\n\"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" opens this weekend.
