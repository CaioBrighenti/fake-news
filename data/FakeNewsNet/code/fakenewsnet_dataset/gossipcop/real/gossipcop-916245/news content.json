In this book, I talk about my roots and how a little girl from the South Side of Chicago found her voice and developed the strength to use it to empower others. I hope my journey inspires readers to find the courage to become whoever they aspire to be. I can\u2019t wait to share my story.\u201d\n\nWriting BECOMING has been a deeply personal experience. I talk about my roots and how a girl from the South Side found her voice. I hope my journey inspires readers to find the courage to become whoever they aspire to be. I can't wait to share my story. https://t.co/d7DxEG85NK \u2014 Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) February 25, 2018\n\nShe and her husband, former President Barack Obama, last year reached a joint agreement with Penguin Random House for their respective books. The deal is believed to be well in excess of $30 million. \u201cBecoming\u201d will be released through the Crown Publishing Group, a Penguin Random House division that has published works by both Obamas.\n\nMemoirs by former first ladies usually sell well, with notable works including Laura Bush\u2019s \u201cSpoken from the Heart\u201d and Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s \u201cLiving History.\u201d Michelle Obama\u2019s memoir is expected to be a major commercial and cultural event. She is admired around the world and has never told her story at length. Her only previous book was a 2012 work on gardening, \u201cAmerican Grown.\u201d\n\nThe book will be published simultaneously in 24 languages, from Swedish to Arabic, and Michelle Obama expects to promote \u201cBecoming\u201d in the U.S. and overseas. She will also narrate the audio version.\n\n\u201cAs first lady of the United States of America \u2014 the first African-American to serve in that role \u2014 she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d Crown said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her_from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world\u2019s most famous address.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama, who has written the million-sellers \u201cDreams from My Father\u201d and \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d has not yet scheduled his memoir. He is expected to focus on his eight years in the White House.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
