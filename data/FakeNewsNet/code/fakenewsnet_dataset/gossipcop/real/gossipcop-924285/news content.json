Frank Marshall and Pat Crowley are returning as producers.\n\nTrevorrow was first tapped by Spielberg to direct the first installment in the rebooted franchise that hit theaters in 2015 and went on to gross $1.6 billion at the global box office.\n\nThe Jurassic World sequel, Fallen Kingdom, is set to bow June 22. Trevorrow, along with Spielberg, is exec producing the feature from director J.A. Bayona.\n\nThis is the first blockbuster Trevorrow has booked following his exit from Star Wars: Episode IX last year. (Directing duties have since been handed over to Force Awakens helmer J.J. Abrams). He is repped by Verve, 3 Arts and Ginsburg Libby.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2018/09/red_dead_redemption_2_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/blogs/promoflag-thr-latest-news.png?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/03/fa96dc45-228d-4df4-b1fa-501b32a1f059.png", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2019/07/gettyimages-1142776438_copy.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/03/fa96dc45-228d-4df4-b1fa-501b32a1f059.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mia Galuppo", "Aaron Couch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/colin-trevorrow-direct-jurassic-world-3-1098625", "title": "Colin Trevorrow to Direct 'Jurassic World 3'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Trevorrow helmed the rebooted franchise's first installment.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/colin-trevorrow-direct-jurassic-world-3-1098625", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Colin Trevorrow to Direct 'Jurassic World 3'", "description": "Trevorrow helmed the rebooted franchise's first installment.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/03/fa96dc45-228d-4df4-b1fa-501b32a1f059.png"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Colin Trevorrow to Direct 'Jurassic World 3'", "description": "Trevorrow helmed the rebooted franchise's first installment.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/colin-trevorrow-direct-jurassic-world-3-1098625", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/03/fa96dc45-228d-4df4-b1fa-501b32a1f059.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "type": "image/png"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Colin Trevorrow to Direct 'Jurassic World 3'", "sailthru.description": "Trevorrow helmed the rebooted franchise's first installment.", "sailthru.author": "Mia Galuppo", "sailthru.channel": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.vertical": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-30 11:02:24", "sailthru.tags": "Heat Vision, Movies, Colin Trevorrow, Jurassic World"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522422144.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
