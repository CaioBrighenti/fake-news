The 20-year-old makeup mogul can thank fans\u2019 fervor over the arrival of her daughter, Stormi, and her booming Kylie Cosmetics business. According to TIME, her sponsored Instagram posts are \u201cworth the equivalent of $1 million (about a fifth the cost of a Super Bowl commercial).\u201d\n\nOther celebrities on the list include Rihanna, President Donald Trump, Korean boy band BTS, fit mommy influencer Sia Cooper and YouTubers Logan and Jake Paul.", "images":
