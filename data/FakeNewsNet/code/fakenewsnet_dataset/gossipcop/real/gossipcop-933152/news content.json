Not Blake!\n\nBlake Lively Models on the Met Gala Red Carpet Blake Lively telling photographers to \u201ccalm down\u201d at the Met Gala is a BIG mood. Posted by E!

So she enlisted the help of her friend and jewelry designer, Lorraine Schwartz. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at the beading of my dress and designing a piece based on that,\u201d Lively told E!News.\n\nHer heels came from Christian Louboutin. \u201cI just sent Lorraine Schwartz and Christian Louboutin my dress, and said, \u2018Ok let\u2019s do something special,'\u201d said the Gossip Girl actress. Lively continued to say that it\u2019s so special that, \u201cThey\u2019re making something custom for it. So it\u2019s kind of nice, because I have a bunch of artists around me who I have direct relationships with.\u201d\n\nWhen you are slaying a Versace gown, Louboutin shoes and custom jewelery and tell people to \u201ccalm down,\u201d they probably will.\n\nWhat has been your mood this 2018?", "images": ["https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2018/05/08061447/rs_1024x759-180507182258-1024-met-gala-2018-blake-lively-1024x759.jpg", "https://d2isblg909whrf.cloudfront.net/themes/wbti/logo.png", "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2014/12/09161951/Concert-Calendar.png", "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2014/12/09161951/APPLE-LOGO.png", "https://www.wbti.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/01d.png", "https://www.wbti.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/01n.png", "https://d2isblg909whrf.cloudfront.net/themes/wbti/facebook.png", "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2014/12/09161951/admin-ajax.png", "https://d2isblg909whrf.cloudfront.net/themes/wbti/listen-live.png", "https://d2isblg909whrf.cloudfront.net/themes/wbti/twitter.png", "https://www.wbti.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/10d.png", "https://www.wbti.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/50n.png", "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2014/12/09161951/Cloings.gif"], "top_img": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2018/05/08061447/rs_1024x759-180507182258-1024-met-gala-2018-blake-lively-1024x759.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wbti.com/2018/05/08/blake-lively-telling-met-gala-paparazzi-to-calm-down-is-the-mood-for-2018/", "title": "Blake Lively Telling Met Gala Paparazzi to \u201cCalm Down\u201d is the Mood for 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Blake Lively showed her mommy-side at this year", "og": {"site_name": "WBTI", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article", "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2018/05/08061447/rs_1024x759-180507182258-1024-met-gala-2018-blake-lively-1024x759.jpg", "title": "Blake Lively Telling Met Gala Paparazzi to \u201cCalm Down\u201d is the Mood for 2018", "url": "https://www.wbti.com/2018/05/08/blake-lively-telling-met-gala-paparazzi-to-calm-down-is-the-mood-for-2018/", "description": "Blake Lively showed her mommy-side at this year\u2019s Met Gala.
