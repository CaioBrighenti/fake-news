Yet in her absence, President Trump \u2014 whose tastes veer toward the gilded, triumphal style of Louis XIV \u2014 replaced her choices with several pieces he liked better. One of two people familiar with the episode cited it as an example of Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency not to relent on even the smallest requests from his wife.\n\nA little more than a year later, Mrs. Trump remains an intensely private first lady still adjusting to the demands of a new life. She has few friends in Washington, keeps a light public schedule and when not watching over her 12-year-old son, Barron, returns home to New York \u2014 at least once per month, two people close to her say \u2014 for meetings and to visit a small circle of associates, including her sister and her hairstylist.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/multimedia/author-maggie-haberman/author-maggie-haberman-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-1/00dc-MELANIA-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-katie-rogers/author-katie-rogers-thumbLarge-v2.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top-sub/00dc-MELANIA-top-sub-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/multimedia/author-julie-hirschfeld-davis/author-julie-hirschfeld-davis-thumbLarge.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Rogers", "Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "Maggie Haberman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "title": "Melania Trump, a Mysterious First Lady, Weathers a Chaotic White House", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-08-17T09:00:24.000Z", "modified": "2018-08-17T13:06:12.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "tag": "United States Politics and Government"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000006051129, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/09d1999a-226a-5950-a56c-f377ba744e2c", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/7bf0a09f24634f7ab005d3293a97ea5c", "description": "On many matters, Mrs. Trump has directed her East Wing to operate independently of the West Wing, and she is still keeping Washington at a distance.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Katie Rogers, Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Maggie Haberman", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Melania Trump,Donald Trump,First Ladies,Trump Tower,White House,Fashion,US Politics", "pdate": 20180817, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "type": "article", "title": "Melania Trump, a Mysterious First Lady, Weathers a Chaotic White House", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "On many matters, Mrs. Trump has directed her East Wing to operate independently of the West Wing, and she is still keeping Washington at a distance."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "title": "Melania Trump, a Mysterious First Lady, Weathers a Chaotic White House", "description": "On many matters, Mrs. Trump has directed her East Wing to operate independently of the West Wing, and she is still keeping Washington at a distance.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/us/politics/00dc-MELANIA-top/00dc-MELANIA-top-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Allies describe Mrs. Trump as warm, engaging and witty, traits at odds with the totemic stance she often takes in public."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000006051129"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "us", "SCG": "politics", "CN": "donald-trump-white-house", "CT": "news-event", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000006051129", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/melania-trump-first-lady.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534478400.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
