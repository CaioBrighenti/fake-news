The singer will be taking the stage for the first time since her kidney transplant, and Bracco said that it's bound to be \"a very emotional night for her.\"\n\nAnother highlight: Christina Aguilera will sing a medley of songs from Whitney Houston's \"The Bodyguard\" soundtrack, released 25 years ago this week.\n\nFred Watkins/ABC via Getty Images\n\n\"Black-ish\" star Tracee Ellis Ross hosts the show, and she's most excited for the performance by her mom, the iconic Diana Ross, who will receive this year's Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n\"There\u2019s so much of an emphasis on youth, but to see a woman whose career has spanned so many decades, that is still performing, still on stage, still singing live, still looking gorgeous ... it shows you what\u2019s possible,\" she told ABC News. \"And people who\u2019ve never seen her ... it\u2019s worth it!\"\n\nThe American Music Awards air live on ABC Sunday night at 8 p.m. ET. Other performers include Niall Horan, Alessia Cara, Demi Lovato, Lady Gaga, Shawn Mendes, Hailee Steinfeld, Nick Jonas and many more.\n\nGary Miller/Getty Images\n\nHere the nominees in some of the top categories.
