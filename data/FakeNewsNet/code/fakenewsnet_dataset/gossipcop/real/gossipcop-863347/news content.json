But how much of that money will she actually take home?\n\nSportscaster Erin Andrews has triumphed in a Nashville courtroom and then ignited social media by winning a $55 million judgment against the stalker who filmed her nude and the hotel where the incident occurred, but her spectacular seeming victory will certainly turn into a far smaller payout.\n\nHer stalker, Michael Barrett, is on the hook for $28 million of that judgment, but Andrews will never see that money. \u201cThey can garnish his wages, but there\u2019s essentially nothing to collect,\u201d says Rick Sanders, a litigator based in Nashville and a partner at Aaron & Sanders. \u201cHe\u2019s a perfect example of a judgment-proof defendant.\u201d\n\nThat leaves the Nashville Marriott and the company that operates it responsible for a little less than $27 million. But Andrews won\u2019t get that amount either.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s legal team has not yet announced their plans, but Sanders says they will ask Davidson County Circuit Court Judge Hamilton Gayden to do one of three things \u2014 overturn the whole judgment, ask for a new trial or request a reduction in damages. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare for a judge to overturn a case like this,\u201d says Sanders. \u201cHe\u2019d have to believe that the jury had lost its mind.\u201d\n\nMany legal experts predict that the case will end in a settlement before it goes to appeals court. \u201cIf I\u2019m the defendant, I\u2019d make my settlement push now, because the farther this case goes, the stronger the position of Andrews becomes,\u201d says Sanders, noting that it\u2019s unlikely that an appellate court that wasn\u2019t present for the original proceedings would overturn the judgment.\n\nWhile TMZ and other outlets speculate that Andrews might have to pay up to 40 percent of the recoverable judgment to her lawyers, Sanders doubts that someone as wealthy as Andrews who hired a first-rate legal team would have done so with a contingency fee. Unlike many less affluent clients, Andrews could probably afford to pay for her attorneys on a pro-rata basis. Sanders estimates that her representation might have run in the neighborhood of $1 million.\n\nSo if Andrews settles with the Nashville Marriott for $20 million, she\u2019s left with something like $19 million. But she won\u2019t get that amount either.\n\nThe last hit would come from the IRS. Awards for emotional distress without any physical injuries are taxable. So if Andrews settled for $20 million, her actual payout would be closer to $10 million. Not a shabby sum, of course, but only 18 percent of the widely reported $55 million judgment.\n\nSanders, who practices in the same county in which this case took place, was surprised at the judgment. \u201cDavidson County juries have a reputation for being parsimonious,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m shocked at the amount. There have been people who have been killed because of negligence who\u2019ve gotten a lot less than this.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2016/03/erin_andrews_court.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/03/erin_andrews_court.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/03/erin_andrews_court.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Flax", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-will-erin-andrews-get-873646", "title": "How Much Will Erin Andrews Get Paid After Winning Her Lawsuit?
