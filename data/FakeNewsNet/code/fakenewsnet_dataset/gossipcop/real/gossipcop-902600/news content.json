He also alleged that he was given a Xanax to \u201ccalm his nerves\u201d before filming.\n\nAnother bottle of vodka appeared in his dressing room during Herzog\u2019s third appearance on Dr. Phil, Herzog alleged, though he said he did not drink it.\n\n\u201cThe Stat article does not fairly or accurately describe the methods of Dr. Phil, the TV show, or its mission to educate millions of viewers about drug and alcohol addiction. The show does not give drugs or alcohol to its guests and any suggestions to the contrary is errant nonsense,\u201d a spokesperson for the program tells PEOPLE in a statement.\n\n\u201cFor the past 16 years, the Dr. Phil show has provided valuable information to viewers by telling compelling stories about people who are fighting the battle to overcome alcohol and drug addiction. Unfortunately, addicts often lash out at the very people who are trying the hardest to help them break the cycle of addiction. Although terribly unfortunate, this is an understandable part of the behavior of addicts on their journey to recovery. Deception, dishonesty and denial are hallmarks of addiction. It tears families apart and certainly creates levels of complexities when we produce these important shows. None of this will deter the Dr. Phil show from it\u2019s commitment to continue to educate and inform the public about the worsening epidemic of addiction.\u201d\n\nMartin Greenberg \u2014 the show\u2019s director of professional affairs \u2014 described Herzog\u2019s claims and others made by former guests and their families to STAT and The Boston Globe as \u201cabsolutely, unequivocally untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not do that with this guest or any other,\u201d Greenberg told STAT of Herzog\u2019s account, later adding, that Herzog was \u201cmedically supervised the entire time\u201d by personnel from an unnamed treatment center during his taping schedule.\n\n(Steve Thomason, the executive director of the center Herzog attended in Texas, claims no one from that facility monitored Herzog in L.A., STAT and The Boston Globe report, explaining that doing so would violate their licenses).\n\n\u201cAddicts are notorious for lying, deflecting and trivializing,\u201d Greenberg added. \u201cBut, if they are at risk when they arrive, then they were at risk before they arrived. The only change is they are one step closer to getting help, typically help they could not have even come close to affording.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the report, families of former guests \u2014 like Marianne Smith (whose niece Jordan appeared on the show) and Joelle King-Parrish (whose pregnant daughter Kaitlin appeared on the show) claimed that producers encouraged them to go to Skid Row in Los Angeles to find drugs, which the King-Parrishs did. They also both claimed that the show did not provide any medical assistance as they awaited taping.\n\n\u201cWe could go on and talk about Jordan L. or ten others. Same reality. All had medical supervision,\u201d Greenberg said in denial, adding that Kaitlin\u2019s mother had allegedly \u201cagreed to be 100 percent responsible for managing her daughter\u2019s health and possible withdrawal\u201d and the individual who filmed the Skid Row trip, \u201csimply documented the natural behavior she observed, which would have occurred whether she was there or not.\u201d\n\nNot all reports were bad, though. Some interviewed for the story praised McGraw and the show for getting them the help they need, like former heroin addict Niki Dietrich.\n\n\u201cFew people contact us just to let us know how well things are going,\u201d the show wrote in a statement to STAT and The Globe. \u201cThe fact you can \u2018cherry pick\u2019 three, or thirty, or three hundred guests for that matter, who seek to blame others for their plight or struggle in life, is not the least bit surprising.\u201d", "images":
