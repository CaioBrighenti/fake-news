While most folks may want to just wait until the announcements after are made and read a list of nominees for Golden Globe awards (we see you, West Coast, where the announcement is happening at 5 a.m.), you do have the option to watch as the nominations are actually announced live.\n\nThe Golden Globe nomination ceremony will be delivered in two ways \u2014 one streaming and one on TV. The streaming option will give you the full video of the announcement of the nominations as they happen. But once the HFPA gets to the biggest awards, the announcement feed will go live on \u201cThe Today Show\u201d on NBC.\n\nTo be clear: you can watch the announcement of all the Golden Globe nominees on the livestream, which you can watch on the Golden Globes Facebook page right here. But if you\u2019re watching \u201cThe Today Show\u201d on NBC, you\u2019ll only get to see some of the nominations be announced.\n\nAlso Read: Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh to Host 2019 Golden Globes\n\nThis all goes down at 8 a.m. ET/5 a.m. PT. There will be a whole opening remarks section of the stream before the nomination announcements actually begin around 8:15 a.m. ET. The \u201cToday Show\u201d segment of the nomination announcement will start around 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\nOnce all that is wrapped up, you\u2019ll be ready to spend your entire day debating the merits of all the nominated movies, TV shows and the people who brought them to life. The Golden Globes ceremony itself will take place on Sunday, Jan. 6 on NBC and will be hosted by Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spider-man-far-from-home-DF-06693_r.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fast-and-furious-every-car-ranked-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CMS_EW_061919_Comedy618x742-1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/envelope.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070919_Whitman_Quibi_1092px.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/golden-globe-awards-nomination-announcement-watch-live-stream-online.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anita-160x105.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChloeDan-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1153289783-1-e1562700127279.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-5.59.05-PM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SpiderMan-Zendaya-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2F5A0156.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/golden-globe-awards-nomination-announcement-watch-live-stream-online.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Phil Owen", "Jeremy Fuster", "Thom Geier", "Ross A.
