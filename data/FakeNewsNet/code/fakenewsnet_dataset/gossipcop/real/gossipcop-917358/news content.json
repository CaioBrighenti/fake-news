On Thursday\u2019s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres show, the 28-year-old skater ran through the rankings of his most passionate celebrity infatuations.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal supposedly is the overall winner, but Mendes comes in at a close second place, and Harry takes third. Rippon claimed Styles used to be high on the list, but he thinks Mendes is cuter, mostly because of his good looks.\n\nWhen talking with Ellen, Adam said he was \u201csleeping on Shawn Mendes,\u201d meaning he underestimated how much he liked him. However, Rippon did have to jokingly concede that he knew such news would possibly break Harry\u2019s heart.\n\nRippon said \u2013 while the audience laughed \u2013 \u201cI know Harry will be upset.\u201d He remarked, \u201cI know, love is a funny thing.\u201d Additionally, the athlete dished on how his life underwent a massive transformation after making it to the Olympics.\n\nAdam said he\u2019s still the \u201csame old hot mess\u201d he was ten years ago but now is life has \u201ccompletely changed.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his crushes and personal life, Rippon revealed he has come to realize the importance of social and political activism in recent months.\n\nThe bronze-medal-winner opened up about the importance of providing a voice for people who may not have one, including his non-formal acquaintances in the LGBTQ community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 28-year-old said going to the Olympics allowed him to use a platform for the greater good, especially for LGTBQ youth. During the final moments of the show \u2013 in a moment of spontaneous generosity \u2013 Ellen awarded Rippon with a cheque for $10,000 to aid Adam in his endeavor to help the disenfranchised.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/michelle-obama-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chiris-Pratt-Nashville-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Shawn-Mendes-And-Camila-Cabello-Are-They-Or-Arent-They-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kenya-Moore-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Camila-Cabello-shawn-mendes-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Camila-Cabello-Shawn-Mendes-300x157.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adam-Rippon-PopSugar.com_-e1519933153446.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Camila-Cabello-Shawn-Mendes-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cardi-B-Remezcla.com--300x200.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adam-Rippon-PopSugar.com_-e1519933153446.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "Audra Bradley", "Grandma R", "Polly Styrene"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/adam-rippon-says-he-prefers-shawn-mendes-to-harry-styles-and-that-love-is-a-funny-thing-120943/", "title": "Adam Rippon Says He Prefers Shawn Mendes To Harry Styles And That \u201cLove Is A Funny Thing\u201d", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "Adam Rippon, harry styles, shawn mendes,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Adam Rippon, harry styles, shawn mendes,", "description": "Adam Rippon had to choose one or the other, and when it comes to who takes his heart, the Olympic athlete said it would have to be Shawn Mendes over", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Adam Rippon Says He Prefers Shawn Mendes To Harry Styles And That \u201cLove Is A Funny Thing\u201d", "description": "Adam Rippon had to choose one or the other, and when it comes to who takes his heart, the Olympic athlete said it would have to be Shawn Mendes over", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/adam-rippon-says-he-prefers-shawn-mendes-to-harry-styles-and-that-love-is-a-funny-thing-120943/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Adam-Rippon-PopSugar.com_-e1519933153446.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-01", "modified_time": "2018-03-01", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/toddmalm/", "section": "Sports", "tag": "shawn mendes"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519880400.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
