Investigators found five 9 mm rounds in the handgun\u2019s magazine and two boxes of ammo that contained 63 bullets in the backpack, according to an incident report made public by RDU police.\n\nMcCreery has a permit to carry a concealed handgun, but he was cited for a misdemeanor violation when he tried to bring the firearm through an airport checkpoint and board a plane with it, authorities reported.\n\nIn a statement to People Magazine, McCreery said, \u201cI have been a concealed carry permit holder for awhile now after being robbed at gunpoint in 2014, and I take gun safety very seriously. While in-between tour dates last week, I went to go target shooting with a friend a few days before an early flight out of my hometown Raleigh-Durham airport.\u201d\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to The News & Observer content across all your devices.

I had my concealed carry permit on me so once they had checked everything out, they then released me to catch the next available flight. Great to know our airport security force is on the job. I have learned a lesson that I won\u2019t forget,\u201d McCreery told the magazine Friday.\n\nPolice stopped the country singer on July 13 at 6 p.m. after the weapon was viewed on an X-ray screen by a Transportation Security Administration employee. The handgun was inside the middle compartment of McCreery\u2019s backpack, the TSA employee reported.\n\nIt was nearly a year ago, in late June, when McCreery sat on the front row in a Wake County courtroom where a judge sentenced a man to at least 17 years in prison for a 2014 home invasion that left McCreery staring down the barrel of a pistol.\n\nMikkail Jamal Shaw, 21, apologized to McCreery and his friends before Judge Paul Ridgeway handed down the sentence.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The News & Observer, McCreery described how after that robbery, he got an enhanced security system at his house and developed a \u201chigher level of alert\u201d in general. He said then he was not particularly worried about security when on the tour bus with his crew.\n\n\u201cMy bus would not be the bus to rob,\u201d he said, laughing, in the 2014 interview. \u201cI\u2019ve got guys that are always equipped to make stuff happen. And one of the guys is like a black belt in every martial arts you can think of.\u201d\n\nHe also discussed the robbery in his 2016 book, \u201cGo Big or Go Home.\u201d He said four men with guns barged into a Raleigh apartment where McCreery and others were watching the movie \u201cGladiator\u201d at about 2 a.m. McCreery said the robbers did not recognize him in his T-shirt, shorts and N.C. State cap.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just looking a bit too normal for them to think anything about me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve been too busy being thugs to keep track of Season 10 of \u2018American Idol.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTSA officials were not available for comment Friday afternoon.\n\nMcCreery was scheduled to perform in Biloxi, Miss., on Friday night and could not be reached for comment.", "images": ["https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=10856&contextPath=7041-10856&pubId=15&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=162963498&type=article&title=%E2%80%98American+Idol%E2%80%99+winner+Scotty+McCreery+cited+for+trying+to+carry+loaded+gun+through+airport+checkpoint&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsobserver.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fcrime%2Farticle162963498.html", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/6f0whs/picture232568702/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/baby.png", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/cq627f/picture232584047/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/barton%20mu_fitted.jpeg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/e2sfrn/picture99273452/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/4159818", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/ax7die/picture231562943/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Screenshot%202019-06-14%20at%2011.18.03%20AM.png", "https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/ft2stp/picture162963478/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SCOTTY08-NE-100114-CCS", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/9z1yf5/picture213417049/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/Military%20Impersonator-Helicopte_fitted.jpeg", "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/cn2sav/picture229773859/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/newspaper.jpg", "https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/logo.svg", "https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/yyv9ql/picture232591707/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/mason_brando_fitted.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/ft2stp/picture162963478/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SCOTTY08-NE-100114-CCS", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thomasi Mcdonald"], "canonical_link": "http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/article162963498.html", "title": "\u2018American Idol\u2019 winner Scotty McCreery cited for trying to carry loaded gun through airport checkpoint | Raleigh News & Observer", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/newsobserver/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "newsobserver", "title": "\u2018American Idol\u2019 winner Scotty McCreery cited for trying to carry loaded gun through airport checkpoint", "description": "Season 10 \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d winner and Garner native Scotty McCreery was cited last week for trying to carry a loaded gun through a passenger checkpoint at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, authorities reported.", "image": "https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/ft2stp/picture162963478/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SCOTTY08-NE-100114-CCS"}, "og": {"site_name": "newsobserver", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018American Idol\u2019 winner Scotty McCreery cited for trying to carry loaded gun through airport checkpoint", "url": "https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/article162963498.html", "description": "Season 10 \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d winner and Garner native Scotty McCreery was cited last week for trying to carry a loaded gun through a passenger checkpoint at Raleigh-Durham International Airport, authorities reported.", "image": "https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/ft2stp/picture162963478/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SCOTTY08-NE-100114-CCS"}, "fb": {"app_id": 571418586252964, "pages": 961356303953721}, "title": "\u2018American Idol\u2019 winner Scotty McCreery cited for trying to carry loaded gun through airport checkpoint | Raleigh News & Observer", "allow-comments": "true", "description": "American Idol winner Scotty McCreery accused of trying to carry a loaded handgun through an RDU checkpoint", "keywords": "Scotty McCreery, concealed handgun, American Idol, Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Transportation Security Administration, RDU", "news_keywords": "Scotty McCreery, concealed handgun, American Idol, Raleigh-Durham International Airport, Transportation Security Administration, RDU", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "original-source": "http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/crime/article162963498.html", "google-site-verification": "0GF1Ok35O1TQ_B8R4lQYz4N1nBr-YJflnAXsHV8ePEo", "parsely-metadata": "{\"article_id\": \"162963498\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.newsobserver.com", "summary": ""}
