Middleton previously wore them in July during the state banquet for the visiting Spanish royals.\n\nWhile her jewelry was on loan from previous generations, Kate\u2019s dress was another recycled gown from her closet and the same dress that Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend Meghan Markle has worn!\n\nThe royal opted for her favorite black Diane von Furstenberg Zarita lace gown that she wore earlier this month during a Kensington Palace gala. She also wore the dress when she was pregnant with Princess Charlotte in November 2014. And a month later, she wore the black evening gown again to a friend\u2019s wedding in London.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/kate-middleton-garden-party.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1919px%2C1007.475px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/duchess-cambridge-sussex-4-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kate-1-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C208px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/princess-diana-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C71px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/royals-6-1.jpg?crop=279px%2C177px%2C2010px%2C1054px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kate-middleton7.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/pippa-middleton-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1295px%2C679.875px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/royal-family-b-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/meghan-markle4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kate-middleton-wimbledon.jpg?crop=0px%2C243px%2C1899px%2C997px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/polo-0.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/meghan-kate-pippa-8-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/trooping-the-colour-61-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C967px%2C1574px%2C826px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/meghan-kate-pippa-6-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/royal-family-necklace.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/princess-diana-16.jpg?crop=0px%2C191px%2C1500px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/prince-william-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/polo-17.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kate-6-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C237px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kate-8.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kate-meghan-wimbledon.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/royal-family-necklace.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kate-12.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/royal-family-necklace.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/kate-middleton-borrows-queen-pearl-choker-once-also-worn-by-princess-diana/", "title": "Kate Middleton Borrows Queen's Necklace That Princess Di Also Wore", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kate middleton, kate middleton pregnant, prince william, prince harry, meghan markle, queen elizabeth, the queen, prince philip, prince charles, queen anniversary, princess diana, Duchess of Cambridge, Duke of Cambridge", "news_keywords": "kate middleton, kate middleton pregnant, prince william, prince harry, meghan markle, queen elizabeth, the queen, prince philip, prince charles, queen anniversary, princess diana, Duchess of Cambridge, Duke of Cambridge", "description": "Style, especially royal style, is timeless.
