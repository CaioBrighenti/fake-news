Social media and Twitter queen Chrissy Teigen recently took to her Instagram page to post a hilarious photo last Sunday, March 4, 2018.\n\nLooking gorgeous as always, in what was not a staged photo at all, hopped onto social media au naturel, sporting nothing but two salad emojis. A currently pregnant Teigen, posed in her modern kitchen making a salad and was covered up with a well-placed towel and some emojis.\n\nVia PEOPLE\n\nIn addition to the hilarious photo, the Lip Sync Battle co-host who has announced that she and hubby John Legend are currently expecting baby number two, captioned the photo saying: \u201cPlz don\u2019t shame me I am a strong proud salad making woman just being natural and trying to live my life.\u201d\n\nThe model announced last month that she and husband Legend are having a baby boy! The star is taking her pregnancy public, as she has been documenting most of it for her fans to see. Although Teigen has been open about her pregnancy by sharing pics of her growing belly, the mom of two-to-be hasn\u2019t always been so comfortable with showing off her body.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Chrissy has cried on John\u2019s shoulders a few times over the body that she doesn\u2019t have. In the August 2017 interview, Chrissy admitted, \u201cThere have been times I\u2019ve cried to John, where I felt like I would never have that body.\u201d She said, \u201cEveryone has a butt now and curves and a little waist and that\u2019s not me.\u201d Well, whatever is you, Chrissy, we\u2019re loving it!\n\nVia PopSugar\n\nTeigen revealed that the pressure of being a social media star and having to constantly look \u201cperfect\u201d for her 16 million followers has gotten to her at times and made her feel \u201cinsanely inadequate\u201d. She told the magazine, \u201cI\u2019m jealous of those bodies and I want that, but I also feel like really want to be cool with my body,\u201d a struggle we all have dealt with one way or another!\n\nChrissy spoke on trying to be as good a role model as she can for daughter Luna, and we think she\u2019s doing just fine. Living your life for the public to see isn\u2019t always easy. However, we think Chrissy is handling it like a pro, all while looking absolutely stunning inside and out!\n\nElmo Tries To Keep The Peace In Epic \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 And \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Crossover", "images": ["https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/cb-logo-full-white.afca2e29.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/tr-logo-full-white.090c581a.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/th-logo-full-white.7684e614.svg", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/91f52889f6a04390a65ad2591c59986e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=952311624915190&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/tq-logo-full-white.7436bde3.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-white.04a6f0d4.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/ts-logo-full-white.54beb4cf.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/hc-logo-full-white.5f66cfe4.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/tg-logo-full-white.fc9e742a.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static1.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1.jpg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-white.fe72c74c.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/sr-logo-full-white.b0cc2b44.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-white.8242bbb9.svg", "https://www.thethings.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-white.642d3d01.svg"], "top_img": "https://static1.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lianna Tedesco", "Larissa Marulli", "Madalyn Cohen", "Helena Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thethings.com/chrissy-teigen-salad-emojis-instagram/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Wears Salad Emojis On Instagram", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Chrissy Teigen is making the internet laugh again with a photo of her making a salad with strategically placed salad emojis.", "og": {"title": "Chrissy Teigen Wears Salad Emojis On Instagram", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static1.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Webp.net-resizeimage-1.jpg", "width": 1710, "height": 900}, "url": "https://www.thethings.com/chrissy-teigen-salad-emojis-instagram/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Chrissy Teigen is making the internet laugh again with a photo of her making a salad with strategically placed salad emojis.", "site_name": "TheThings"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-11T14:03:51Z", "section": "LOL"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1704776379798523, "pages": 816297408482105}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520777031.0, "source": "https://www.thethings.com", "summary": ""}
