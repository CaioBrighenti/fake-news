The private couple kept mum about their relationship while promoting the movie a year later and only posed together at the New York premiere of the film.\n\nThe Oscar winner was first spotted dining with the Brooklyn native in New York City in August. They then spent time in Los Angeles in October, where they had an intimate dinner with her close friends at the Commissary restaurant at The Line Hotel. In November, they joined forces to encourage college students to get out and vote.\n\nLawrence was previously linked to British actor Nicholas Hoult and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.\n\nThe director was previously in a nine-year relationship with actress Rachel Weisz (the two have a son, 10-year-old Henry) before they broke up in 2010, and Weisz moved on to marry her Dream House costar Daniel Craig.\n\nThe two dated for a year before splitting in November 2017.\n\nImage zoom Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Martin Getty (2)\n\nChris Martin\n\nLawrence also dated Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, whom she began seeing in August 2014, five months after his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow filed for divorce. Martin, 41, and Lawrence dated for four months before they broke up the first time in October 2014.\n\nThen in late December of that year, the pair were presumably back together after they were spotted on a dinner date. In January 2015, they attended Harry Styles\u2019 21st birthday party in Los Angeles, then they were seen enjoying a cozy weekend in New York City in April and again spotted together in May in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, in August 2015, multiple sources told PEOPLE Lawrence and Martin broke up for the final time.\n\nImage zoom Nicholas Hoult and Jennifer Lawrence Dave M. Benett/Getty\n\nNicholas Hoult\n\nBefore Martin and before Aronofsky, there was Hoult. While filming X-Men: First Class in 2010, Kentucky-born Lawrence began a romance with her British costar, 29. They briefly split in 2013 before reuniting both off and onscreen in X-Men: Days of Future Past. They ultimately ended their five-year relationship in August 2014.\n\nIn November 2015, Lawrence admitted she felt lost after she ended her romance with Hoult around the same time that filming for the last Hunger Games movie wrapped. \u201cI was also in a relationship with somebody for five years and we broke up around the same time I wrapped the movies. Being 24 was this whole year of, \u2018Who am I without these movies? Who am I without this man?'\u201d she told ABC News\u2019 Diane Sawyer.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jennifer Lawrence Supports Ex and \u2018Very Good Friend\u2019 Darren Aronofsky at N.Y.C. Event\n\nBefore linking up with Aronofsky, Lawrence had over six months of singledom, during which she told Vogue, \u201cNo one ever asks me out. I am lonely every Saturday night. Guys are so mean to me.\u201d\n\nIn her December 2015 cover, she also shared, \u201cI\u2019m just a girl who wants you to be nice to me. I am straight as an arrow. I feel like I need to meet a guy, with all due respect, who has been living in Baghdad for five years who has no idea who I am.\u201d\n\nThough she\u2019s had her romantic ups and downs, Lawrence \u201ccan\u2019t wait to be married.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like if I find that one person who I want to spend the rest of my life with, who I want to be the father of my children, that I would absolutely not f\u2014 it up,\u201d she told Vogue.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/elijah-wood-2.jpg?crop=102px%2C195px%2C1538px%2C807px&resize=1200%2C630",
