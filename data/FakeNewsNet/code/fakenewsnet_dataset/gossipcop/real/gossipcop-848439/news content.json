He will report for his prison sentence on July 11.\n\nThe 47-year-old wept and apologized during the court hearing Wednesday, saying he took full responsibility for his behavior, according to The Chicago Tribune.\n\n\u201cI alone am responsible for the devastation,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI will spend the rest of my life asking for forgiveness.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: What Is the Grammy Bounce? (No, It\u2019s Not a Dance Move)\n\nThe Tribune reports Schwartz could have faced more than 20 years in federal prison after pleading guilty, but Judge Dolly Gee suggested a sentencing guideline around five to six years.\n\nMorissette urged a harsher sentence in a victim statement at the hearing, the newspaper reports, saying he had stolen her trust and money.\n\n\u201cHe did this in a long, systematic, drawn-out and sinister manner,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/gettyimages-458361366.jpg",
