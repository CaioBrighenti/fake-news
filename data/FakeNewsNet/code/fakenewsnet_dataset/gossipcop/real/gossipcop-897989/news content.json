The local gossip site reported the former Miss USA was not in attendance at a mandatory meeting for the \u2018wives. When folks inquired about her absence, it was reportedly confirmed she won\u2019t be in season 11.\n\nSources tell the website Moore may be relegated to being a friend of the show, however, Bravo won\u2019t confirm the cast line up until later in the summer, according to AJC Radio & TV Talk.\n\nReportedly, just four cast members are scheduled to be back: NeNe Leakes, Kandi Burruss, Cynthia Bailey and Porsha Williams.\n\nThat Moore isn\u2019t joining a new season shouldn\u2019t come as a total shock. Head honchos at Bravo were none too pleased when the star eloped with Marc Daly and he refused to show up on the show until the second half of the season. Additionally, Moore was noticeably absent from the regularly scheduled trip overseas, which was in Spain this season.\n\nStill, RHOA executive producer Andy Cohen told \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d Friday that Moore had no issues getting along with the other \u2018wives.\n\n\u201cKenya is good with the group,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Moore herself has yet to say anything else regarding rumors about her return, Twitter users have been chatting.\n\n\u201cKenya Moore is finally off rhoa thank the lord, hallelujah.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs @KenyaMoore really fired from #RHOA? Because if she is I ain\u2019t watching no\u2019mo!\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=526423591160886&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=268741230617931&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21021403&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=80&d=mm&r=g", "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-462716400-300x200.jpg", "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ABS_Logo_White_Aweber.png", "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/pjimage-1-218x150.jpg", "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-462716400.jpg", "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ABS_Logo_Black-600x64.png", "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/65156380_512577466144804_7643110053041496866_n-e1562682424372-218x150.jpg", "http://c.statcounter.com/7877571/0/476687fa/1/", "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/65492007_2274189809343910_5002998734358226483_n-e1562867524794-218x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-462716400.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kiersten Willis"], "canonical_link": "https://atlantablackstar.com/2018/05/31/kenya-moore-silent-as-rumors-of-her-rhoa-firing-builds/", "title": "Kenya Moore Silent As Rumors of Her RHOA Firing Build", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-462716400.jpg", "secure_url": "https://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-462716400.jpg", "width": 1068, "height": 711}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kenya Moore Silent As Rumors of Her RHOA Firing Build", "description": "Despite Kenya Moore's denial that she's not been fired by Bravo, reports say she won't appear on \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" next season.
