In March 2017, Shelton offered to propose to Stefani on the show, which she said would be \"a dream come true.\" They're constantly flirting on air. The Voice producer Mark Burnett told People in September 2016, \"I had no idea by coming to work on a fun music show they would find the loves of their life, and the light exploded and they are happier than you can imagine. We are all thrilled to be their friends and see the happiness.\"\n\n\n\nStill, it's not all roses and PDA behind the scenes. A production source told Radar Online, \"Gwen and Blake are actually becoming really competitive with each other this season and it is quite fun to watch. Whereas they used to help each other and kind of be on the same team, they are both really out to win it this time around\u2026They have been arguing a lot backstage when the cameras are not rolling. Blake and Gwen are not calling each other cutesy names like they used to and they are not acting all lovey-dovey like they have been in the past!\"\n\n\n\nPreviously, Stefani and Shelton were both rumored to want out of their contracts, but they both seem to want to stick around as long as they're together.", "images": ["https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/odd-things-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship/their-colleagues-side-eye-them-somewhat.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "http://wp.looper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/weird-things-everyone-ignores-about-gwen-and-blake_s-relationship.gif", "https://img4.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/odd-things-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship/it-could-be-a-pr-stunt.jpg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/odd-things-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship/and-they-both-hinted-that-the-relationship-is-good-for-press.jpg", "https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/odd-things-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship/the-timing-was-suspicious.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://img4.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/odd-things-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship/he-met-her-kids-really-early-on.jpg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/odd-things-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship/they-began-discussing-marriage-right-away.jpg", "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/odd-things-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship/they-wont-shut-up-about-it.jpg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/odd-things-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship/intro.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg"], "top_img": "http://wp.looper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/weird-things-everyone-ignores-about-gwen-and-blake_s-relationship.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/50658/odd-things-gwen-stefani-blake-sheltons-relationship/", "title": "Weird things everyone ignores about Gwen & Blake's relationship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://wp.looper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/weird-things-everyone-ignores-about-gwen-and-blake_s-relationship.gif", "title": "Weird things everyone ignores about Gwen & Blake's relationship", "description": "Their relationship moved at lightning speed, for starters.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nickiswift.com/50658/odd-things-gwen-stefani-blake-sheltons-relationship/", "site_name": "NickiSwift.com"}, "twitter": {"title": "Weird things everyone ignores about Gwen & Blake's relationship", "description": "Their relationship moved at lightning speed, for starters.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NickiSwiftCeleb", "image": "http://wp.looper.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/weird-things-everyone-ignores-about-gwen-and-blake_s-relationship.gif"}, "title": "Weird things everyone ignores about Gwen & Blake's relationship", "description": "Their relationship moved at lightning speed, for starters.", "fb": {"pages": 915319058545299, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "enable=true ad_density=default"}, "article": {"author": "Jessica Sager"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f7a286f935bd433580c2d31f5d66fea9"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.nickiswift.com", "summary": ""}
