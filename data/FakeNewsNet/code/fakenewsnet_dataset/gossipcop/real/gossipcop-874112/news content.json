I\u2019m naturally nurturing, and I just can\u2019t wait to have our baby,\u201d Jade said of her husband, known to work long hours as general sales manager at Legends Toyota.\n\nJade, who once considered working as a doula, told In Touch she\u2019d like to have an at-home water birth if the pregnancy is low-risk. \u201cBut Tanner\u2019s a little concerned,\u201d she said.\n\nLove happened quickly for Tanner, 29, who grew up in Overland Park, and Jade, 30, who within a few weeks\u2019 time in 2015 met, fell in love and got engaged on \u201cBachelor in Paradise 2,\u201d a spinoff of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Tanner had competed on the Kaitlyn Bristowe season of \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d and Jade was one of Chris Soules\u2019 final four on \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d\n\nThey recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary. They married in California in January 2016 in a ceremony ABC aired the next month on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nTheir relationship hit the shoals of wedded bliss when they appeared on \u201cMarriage Boot Camp\u201d last year. After a lot of arguing and tears shed, Jade told Us Weekly the experience was \u201cgood\u201d for them.\n\nThey found out Jade was pregnant after she took an at-home pregnancy test, they told In Touch. \u201cJade cried a little bit. I was just really excited,\u201d Tanner said. The baby is due Sept. 14.\n\nThe two bought land in the Stilwell area last year to build a house, clearly with a future family on their minds.\n\nAdulting real hard today. Tanner and I just put a deposit down on a few acres to build our home together! \u2764\ufe0f #jannerforever #jannermanor A post shared by Jade Tolbert (@jadelizroper) on Jan 10, 2016 at 2:30pm PST\n\n\u201cWe bought four and a half acres out there because Jade wanted to have horses like she did growing up, and that\u2019s our plan,\u201d Tanner told Bustle last year.\n\nThey planned a four-bedroom home with five-and-a-half bathrooms and a man cave for possible \u201cBachelor\u201d viewing parties.\n\n\u201cWe will watch down there cause nothing says \u2018man cave\u2019 like watching \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 right?\u201d Tanner joked to Bustle.\n\nAt the time, Jade said she was working with an interior designer to create a scheme unlike the Kansas City style she described to Bustle as dark wood and dark walls.\n\n\u201cI want to really lighten it up and make it kind of Parisian,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I want a white kitchen with lots of windows and natural light.\u201d\n\nShe had hinted to Us Weekly at a \u201cBachelor\u201d premiere event in Los Angeles in January that the couple had \u201cbabies on the mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a house, and it\u2019s got a lot of room for children! I just turned 30 in December, so I\u2019m ready,\u201d the former Playboy model said. \u201cI would love a baby in 2017.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/evb6p6/picture213255279/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/stormy.jpg", "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/vy6yw1/picture213906354/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/simpsonpic.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/iqnt79/picture220896620/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/duet%20cropped.jpg", "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/hu5qzy/picture222899105/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/mel%20b%20cast.png", "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/tzs5qd/picture221888975/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/grandcanyo_fitted.jpeg", "https://www.kansascity.com/wps/build/images/kansascity/logo.svg", "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/vmru2f/picture223006045/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/gilmoregirls.jpg", "https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=2539&contextPath=2414-2539&pubId=4&cat=&meta=read-blogpost&objId=137672633&type=article&title=%E2%80%98Bachelor+in+Paradise%E2%80%99+stars+Jade+and+Tanner+Tolbert+of+KC+are+expecting+a+baby&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kansascity.com%2Fentertainment%2Fent-columns-blogs%2Fstargazing%2Farticle137672633.html", "https://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/stargazing/2op87t/picture137672628/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/tanner", "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/3uijoa/picture212683114/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/kanye.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/stargazing/2op87t/picture137672628/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/tanner", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Gutierrez", "Jade Tolbert"], "canonical_link": "http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/ent-columns-blogs/stargazing/article137672633.html", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 stars Jade and Tanner Tolbert are expecting a baby", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/kansascity/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "KCStar", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 stars Jade and Tanner Tolbert of KC are expecting a baby", "description": "After a whirlwind TV romance, Jade and Tanner Tolbert are adding to their \u201cBachelor\u201d family.
