I don't have cable, so I didn't actually know about it until I randomly saw Elizabeth Hurley on a talk show promoting it. I immediately watched S1 on Prime, and coughed up the $20 to buy S2. Some things that should be noted if you are trying to decide whether or not to watch, consider this:\n\n\n\n1) Don't listen to the low reviewers who are giving it 1-3 Stars because it's not \"true to the UK\". Of *COURSE* it's not \"true to the UK. This show is on E!, not BBC or PBS. People watch this show to be entertained, not to learn how the monarchy really works.\n\n\n\n2) The fun thing about this show is that it's all made up. It isn't true life or how the real \"royals\" really are. It's actually a lot more sensationalized and more fun. There's mystery, love, murder, scandal, intrigue - you won't find any tea parties here. What's even better about this is that it's a non-reality show that doesn't involve medical stuff, police, or firefighters. (Don't get me wrong, I absolutely appreciate what all first-responders do, but I'm not interested enough to watch shows about them). The aspect of the royal family and all their made-up scandals makes it fun to watch.\n\n\n\n3) The soundtrack to this show is AWESOME! I've come across some cool new artists that I wouldn't have otherwise known about had it not been for this show. After every episode, I find myself Googling who the musical artists were so I can download more of their songs.\n\n\n\nThings about this show that I'm not a fan of:\n\n1) The whole \"will they, or won't they\" with the Liam / Ophelia pairing. Ophelia is just boring. Sure, she's pretty, but there's nothing interesting about her character at all. The whole \"common girl becomes a princess\" storyline has been overdone SO MANY TIMES and is so predictable. Unfortunately, I don't think her character will be going away any time soon, considering the happenings in the S2 finale. That's too bad. In S1, I was really rooting for Gemma, but now that the actress who plays her has left the show (which is unfortunate, she did an amazing job as Gemma), I've been hoping Wilhelmina wins the heart of Liam. Wilhelmina has spunk and actual personality.\n\n\n\n2) There are only 10 episodes per season. That makes me so sad :(", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41G9RH-BEnL._SX268_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71OSe0haj5L._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg",
