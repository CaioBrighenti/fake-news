She was on her way,\u201d Angela shares. \u201cOur doctor made our gentle cesarean so special by allowing us to play our own music in the operating room, letting us witness her being born and giving me the privilege of skin to skin as soon as she was born.\u201d\n\nMatt admits that he was \u201cnervous being in the operating room because it all feels so high-stakes surgical,\u201d but the nervousness fell away when he \u201csaw her and heard her cry for the first time.\u201d\n\nUpon meeting their baby girl, it was love at first sight for the couple.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most gorgeous baby ever,\u201d Angela recalls about seeing MacKenlee for the first time. \u201cI just thought to myself, she\u2019s perfect,\u201d says Matt.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?
