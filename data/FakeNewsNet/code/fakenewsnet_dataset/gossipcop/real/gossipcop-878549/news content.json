I was insecure about my lips, and lipstick is what helped me feel confident,\u201d Jenner explained to fellow beauty mogul Kardashian West.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most authentic thing I\u2019ve done in my career, and it really relates to me, and I feel like people can tell that I\u2019m super passionate about it,\u201d Jenner said about being an entrepreneur. \u201cI feel like people could see that it\u2019s authentic to me, and it was organic, and it just worked!\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kylie Jenner Opens Up to Kim Kardashian About Stormi\u2019s Unique Name & Joys of Changing Diapers\n\nImage zoom Kylie Jenner in 2007 and in 2017 Jeff Vespa/WireImage; Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images for New York Fashion Week\n\nIn May 2015, Jenner admitted that she enhanced her lips with temporary fillers after spending years overlining her mouth.\n\nAnd years later, in September 2017, the mother of one revealed she got fuller lips after a boy assumed she\u2019d be a bad kisser because of her naturally thin lips.\n\n\u201cI was 15 and I was insecure about my lips. I have really small lips. And it was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, \u2018I didn\u2019t think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.\u2019 But I took that really hard,\u201d Jenner shared during an episode of her E! spin-off series, Life of Kylie.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I just didn\u2019t feel desirable or pretty. I really wanted bigger lips. I would overline my lips with lip liner just to create the illusion of bigger lips. And then finally I was like this lip liner isn\u2019t doing it. [I] ended up getting my lips done,\u201d she added.\n\nRELATED: Every Occasion the KarJenners Have Celebrated by Showing Off Their Butts\n\nImage zoom Kylie Jenner in March Kylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nWhile she has previously confessed to getting lip fillers, Jenner told Kardashian West that she is currently not pursuing any other procedures.\n\n\u201cI feel like if it makes you feel better, and if that\u2019s what you want to do, I\u2019m not against it,\u201d she said about plastic surgeries. \u201cRight now I probably wouldn\u2019t do anything, actually.\u201d\n\nOlder sister Kardashian West quipped, \u201cYou\u2019re 20, so I hope not! We\u2019ll talk in 20 years, and then maybe you\u2019ll have a different answer.\u201d", "images":
