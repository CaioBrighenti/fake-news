The answer to which member of the legendary \u201980s movie-star posse, The Brat Pack, got \u201claid\u201d the most might not surprise you: the bad boy.\n\nWhen Andy Cohen asked Anthony Michael Hall on Watch What Happens Live this week which Brat Pack member was making the most of their fame \u201cback in the day,\u201d Hall didn\u2019t hesitate for long.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with Judd Nelson,\u201d he said.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t all Hall had to say about his former castmates during Cohen\u2019s \u201cPlead the Fifth\u201d segment, in which stars can choose to answer risqu\u00e9 questions about their past or invoke their right to silence. On this Brat Pack-themed bit, Cohen prodded Hall about which of his three female contemporaries he would \u201cShag, Marry, Kill.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: EW\u2019s Top Ten Rom-Com Movie Moments\n\nAmong Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore and Molly Ringwald, Hall quickly decided he would marry Moore and \u201cshag\u201d Sheedy. Left with the unsavory answer of offing his former Breakfast Club costar, Hall said, \u201cI love you Molly, but I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Universal Pictures\n\nThe former teen heartthrob is currently starring as Brad Pitt\u2018s right-hand man in the Netflix dramedy War Machine, based on members of the U.S. military during the war in Afghanistan.
