Inspired by the iconic gown worn by Grace Kelly at her 1956 wedding to Prince Rainier of Monaco, Kerr's wedding dress was crafted by Dior's artistic director, Maria Grazia Chiuri. When it came to beauty, the brunette stunner kept it simple with minimal makeup and a classic low bun. But here's the kicker: Her wedding-day hair took a total of only 15 minutes to achieve!\n\nFor context, the Aussie model rocked the same low bun on the red carpet for the 2017 Vanity Fair Oscars party (pictured below), courtesy of celebrity hairstylist Ericka Verrett. The style is sleek, minimal, and totally transitional for day-to-night wear. The celebrity hairstylist dished on how to get the look to E! News .\n\nPinterest JB Lacroix\n\nStart with freshly cleaned dry hair, and spray a thickening spray from root to tip while combing the product through the hair. Create a center part and comb hair into a pony. Secure at the nape of the neck. Wrap a small hair net around the hair (preferably one that matches your hair color), twist into a chignon, and secure with clear hairpins. Use a shine serum to polish hair and smooth away any flyaways. Finish the look with a light hairspray, and voil\u00e0!\n\nSee More: Meryl Davis Is Engaged to Longtime Boyfriend Fedor Andreev\n\nTo rewind, Kerr quietly wed Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel in late May during an intimate ceremony in her Los Angeles home.
