But she still makes less than the world\u2019s 14 richest actors.\n\nLooking at Forbes\u2019 highest-paid actors list, Stone is 14 places below other male stars in terms of total earnings, including her La La Land co-star Ryan Gosling. Mark Wahlberg took the top spot after earning $68 million over the last year for his roles in Transformers: The Last Knight (which has a 15% score on Rotten Tomatoes), Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day. Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson was second with $65 million\u2014dethroned from his top spot last year\u2014and Vin Diesel was third with $54.5 million.\n\nThe top 10 highest-paid actors on the Forbes list made a combined total of $488.5 million compared to the $172.5m that the 10 highest-paid actresses made, shining another light on the disparity between men and women in Hollywood.\n\nThis disparity, Forbes added, is attributable to the roles that are available.\n\n\u201cIn release schedules dominated by superhero movies and brawny blockbusters, there are simply fewer parts for women that pay the sizeable backend profits that result in leading men\u2019s large paydays, or the franchise sequels that permit aggressive negotiation for favorable deals.\u201d", "images":
