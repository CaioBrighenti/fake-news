In came star Chris Hemsworth, sporting a dollar store Thor costume and long, blonde wig and hammer. Next, Tom Hiddleston, similarly decked out in knock-off apparel and a bad wig, walked on stage to raucous applause. That wasn't all, however, as Cate Blanchett, who stars as Hela, Goddess of Death in the film, showed up with an array of pipe cleaners on her back, fashioned to imitate the horns of her character.\n\n\"I think those poor people just want to watch the movie,\" Blanchett said in a taped interview backstage.\n\nThe opening scene done, Jeff Goldblum, who plays the Grandmaster in the film, made an entrance on a scooter to introduce his \"grand champion,\" Mark Ruffalo, who, of course, was dressed in a cheap Hulk costume with green, rubber fists.\n\nHemsworth and Ruffalo battled their way through the crowded theater that preluded a \"brief, 45-minute intermission,\" as announced by Corden.\n\nWhen the show returned, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Hiddleston and Tessa Thompson squared off against Blanchett and her \"ferocious guard dog\" \u2014 a stuffed huskie dog. \"And they all lived happily ever after...until the next Thor movie,\" Corden narrated.\n\nBackstage, the actors celebrated. \"Thor: Ragnarok 4D gets 10 Goldblums out of a possible 10 Goldblums. That's my highest rating,\" Goldblum said.\n\nWatch the video below.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/10/xmen_tv_400_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/scale_crop_768_433/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2016/12/aaeaaqaaaaaaaafiaaaajgyxmtvhnmm0ltcynjetngvmmy1iyzvllwq4odlhyzqwzjyznw.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/static/frontend/2017_11_02_1101/assets//images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/10/thor_still_and_thor_ragnorak_still_-_split_-_photofest_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn3.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2014/02/cate_blanchett_bafta.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2016/05/gettyimages-510455694-h_2016.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/09/thor-_ragnarok_still_3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn5.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2017/04/thor.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_heatvision.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Shanley", "Patrick.Shanley Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/thor-ragnarok-cast-act-live-performance-surprised-theater-1054678", "title": "'Thor: Ragnarok' Cast Acts Out Live Performance for Surprised Theater", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson treated an unexpected audience to a 4D experience on the 'Late Late Show With James Corden.'", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/thor-ragnarok-cast-act-live-performance-surprised-theater-1054678", "domain": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "'Thor: Ragnarok' Cast Acts Out Live Performance for Surprised Theater", "description": "Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson treated an unexpected audience to a 4D experience on the 'Late Late Show With James Corden.'", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "'Thor: Ragnarok' Cast Acts Out Live Performance for Surprised Theater", "description": "Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson treated an unexpected audience to a 4D experience on the 'Late Late Show With James Corden.'", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/thor-ragnarok-cast-act-live-performance-surprised-theater-1054678", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855im_/http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "'Thor: Ragnarok' Cast Acts Out Live Performance for Surprised Theater", "sailthru.description": "Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson treated an unexpected audience to a 4D experience on the 'Late Late Show With James Corden.'", "sailthru.author": "Patrick Shanley", "sailthru.channel": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.vertical": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-03 09:31:18", "sailthru.tags": "Heat Vision, Movies, Television, Cate Blanchett, Chris Hemsworth, James Corden, Jeff Goldblum, Tom Hiddleston, The Late Late Show, Thor: Ragnarok"}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171103200855if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/8atgsWFfDOg"], "publish_date": 1509715878.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
