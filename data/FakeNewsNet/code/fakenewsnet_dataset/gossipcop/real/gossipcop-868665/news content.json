And to a large degree, that\u2019s because, unlike most other actors who have donned the cape and cowl, he played the senior partner in the Dynamic Duo as someone really, truly, and unapologetically enjoying the dichotomy of being a suave millionaire who moonlights as a masked vigilante. Never mind that the \u201860s \u201cBatman\u201d TV series had a limited novelty value in its time \u2014 it lasted scarcely two years on ABC \u2014 and, truth to tell, is better remembered than actually re-watched. Thanks to endless reruns of the series and the easy availability of the 1966 movie, West\u2019s straight-faced yet drolly self-satirical take on the Caped Crusader \u2014 The Light Knight, if you will \u2014 remains the Batman who looms largest for the largest number of people in the pop-culture pantheon.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/christian-bale.jpg?w=1000", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/val-kilmer.jpg?w=700", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/robert-lowery.jpg?w=1000", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ben-affleck1.jpg?w=1000", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2Fgallery%2Fbatman-actors-ranked-worst-best%2F&ct=gallery&lob=pmc-core&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202617818", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/keaton.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/george-clooney.jpg?w=700", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/adam-west.jpg?w=700", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/lewis-wilson.jpg?w=700", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/michael-keaton.jpg?w=1000", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/batman1.jpg?w=1000", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2017/assets/build/images/_inlined/variety-logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/keaton.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Leydon"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/gallery/batman-actors-ranked-worst-best/", "title": "Batman Actors Ranked From Worst to Best", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "A look at every Batman actor ranked from worst to best.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "news_keywords": "Adam West, Batman, Ben Affleck, Christian Bale, Justice League", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Batman Actors Ranked From Worst to Best", "url": "https://variety.com/gallery/batman-actors-ranked-worst-best/", "description": "Holy listicle, Batfans!
