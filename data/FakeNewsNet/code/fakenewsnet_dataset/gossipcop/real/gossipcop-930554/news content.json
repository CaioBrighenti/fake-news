From her head-turning accessories to her intricate hairstyles, she always impresses us on the carpet in outfits she proudly styles herself. And on Thursday she surprised us once again when she showed up to CinemaCon in Las Vegas wearing an ultra-short Sonia Rykiel tuxedo dress paired with a colorful bowtie.\n\nLively attended the Lionsgate presentation at CinemaCon in a midnight blue double-breasted blazer over a white collared shirt, complete with an orange pattern bow tie from Charleston-based brand Brackish, for a look that gives us total Gossip Girl flashbacks. She finished off her look with a pair of graphic-print Christian Louboutin pumps.\n\nImage zoom Ethan Miller/Getty\n\nShe wore her hair pulled back into a half up-do with wavy, teased strands by her go-to hairstylist, Rod Ortega, and a clean makeup look with pretty pink lip by makeup artist Kristofer Buckle.\n\nRELATED: Shop the Affordable and Chic Jewelry Brand Blake Lively, Jessica Alba and More Stars Can\u2019t Stop Wearing\n\nShe\u2019s been on a colorful style streak lately, recently wearing a rainbow ensemble for a visit to Sesame Street.
