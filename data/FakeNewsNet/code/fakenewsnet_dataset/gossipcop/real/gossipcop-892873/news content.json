Gorgeous\n\nGorgeous, which was released prior to the full album release, is about someone who finds it hard to look at another person because they\u2019re strongly attracted to them and the fear of rejection lies therein. \u201cYou ruined my live by not being mine.\u201d\n\nDuring one of Swift\u2019s Secret Sessions where she played the album ahead of the release for fans, Swift reportedly said, \u201cIf anyone made accusations of who this song is about we tell them it is 100 percent about her angel boyfriend of one year\u201d \u2013 referring to her British actor boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.\n\nThe song also features a cameo by Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\u2019s daughter, James, who can be heard saying \u201cgorgeous\u201d at the beginning of the track. Always a rumour, the story was confirmed in July, 2018, when Reynolds and Lively were seen filming and jumping around in joy during a Swift concert, all but confirming it was indeed their
