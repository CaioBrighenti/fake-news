I clearly don\u2019t make movies for children,\u201d concluded Kunis, who has starred in films such as Black Swan, Friends with Benefits and Forgetting Sarah Marshall as well as TV projects such as Family Guy and That \u201970s Show.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

We didn\u2019t give her anything \u2014 it was the grandparents. The kid no longer appreciates the one gift. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re expecting; they\u2019re just expecting stuff.\u201d\n\nA Bad Moms Christmas hits theaters Nov. 1.", "images":
