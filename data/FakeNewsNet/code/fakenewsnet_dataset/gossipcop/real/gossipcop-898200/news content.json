It wasn\u2019t worth living. I was wasting people\u2019s time and space.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGMA\u201d star opens up in her new book, \u201cNatural Disaster: I Cover Them. I Am One,\u201d about her battle with depression.\n\nIn the introduction to the book, she writes that she checked herself into a mental health hospital just 10 days before starting her high-profile job at ABC.\n\n\"I cover natural disasters, and I've struggled with being one in my personal life,\" she wrote.\n\nShe recalled to People, \u201cI lost myself and my will to live.\u201d\n\nShe said when feeling depressed she \u201cfelt helpless\u201d and \u201chopeless.\u201d\n\nZee had previously revealed she battled anorexia and was narcoleptic in college. She told the magazine she thinks medication she was taking in college contributed to her suicidal thoughts.\n\n\u201cIn that moment, my brain, and probably a chemical somewhere within me, said, \u2018You need to kill yourself.\u2019 The only voices I could hear were telling me, \u2018You are not worth it\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGood Morning America\u201d host said her struggle with depression began to improve as she saw her career skyrocket.\n\nWhen she turned 25, she landed an on-air job for a local NBC station that improved her outlook on life.\n\n\u201cI was in this place where I knew my personal life could affect this outstanding job and opportunity that I had,\u201d she revealed. \u201cFor the first time in a long time, I wanted to live and I knew that.\u201d\n\nStill, she struggled along the way and \u2500 she reveals in her book \u2500 she sought help at a facility as she prepared for her job at ABC.\n\nShe said learning how to best take her medicine helped her recover.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to learn to live on that medication responsibly, because I can\u2019t not have it. You have to be really, really careful with it.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/03/20/270/152/694940094001_6016245421001_6016243115001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/ginger-zee-book-cover-amazon.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/06/10/270/152/694940094001_6046645781001_6046635572001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/348/196/tmz-only.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/348/196/db70e6da-tmz-only.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/348/196/TMZ-ONLY-halsey.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/270/152/rkellycourt.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/142706_ginger-0452r1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/270/152/wim.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/348/196/TMZ-ONLY-brooks.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/348/196/TMZ-ONLY-edc.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ginger-zee-book-cover-amazon.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ginger-zee-book-cover-amazon.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/good-morning-americas-ginger-zee-reveals-past-suicide-attempt", "title": "'Good Morning America's' Ginger Zee reveals past suicide attempt", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\u201cGood Morning America\u201d meteorologist Ginger Zee attempted suicide at the age of 21.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "'Good Morning America's' Ginger Zee reveals past suicide attempt", "dcterms.abstract": "\u201cGood Morning America\u201d meteorologist Ginger Zee attempted suicide at the age of 21.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "\u201cGood Morning America\u201d meteorologist Ginger Zee attempted suicide at the age of 21.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:6c41bd7c-6972-517c-a3db-6d301cd9918d", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-12-05", "dcterms.created": "2017-12-05T08:36:03-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-12-05T09:19:12-05:00", "og": {"title": "'Good Morning America's' Ginger Zee reveals past suicide attempt", "description": "\u201cGood Morning America\u201d meteorologist Ginger Zee attempted suicide at the age of 21.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ginger-zee-book-cover-amazon.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/good-morning-americas-ginger-zee-reveals-past-suicide-attempt", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "'Good Morning America's' Ginger Zee reveals past suicide attempt", "description": "\u201cGood Morning America\u201d meteorologist Ginger Zee attempted suicide at the age of 21.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/ginger-zee-book-cover-amazon.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/good-morning-americas-ginger-zee-reveals-past-suicide-attempt"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Celebrity News,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "celebrity,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
