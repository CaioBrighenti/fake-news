Jessica Chastain\u2019s heart burns there, too.\n\nMaybe.\n\nThe Zero Dark Thirty actress is in talks to join the sequel to Stephen King\u2019s It, playing the adult version of the flame-haired character who inspired that secret admirer\u2019s poem, EW has confirmed.\n\nEver since New Line announced that King\u2019s epic 1986 novel would be split into two parts, it has been obvious to most people, including director Andy Muschietti, that Chastain would be perfect to play the grown-up Bev, who returns to the town of Derry with her fellow Losers nearly 27 years later to face the evil, shapeless presence they defeated as children.\n\nChastain previously worked with Muschietti on the 2013 horror film Mama, and during post-production on It, the filmmaker told EW he hoped to recruit her to the Losers\u2019 Club if the sequel became a reality. Now that It stands as the highest grossing horror film of all time, with $700 million in earnings worldwide, things are pretty real.\n\nVariety first reported that Chastain is in talks for the film, which is scheduled for release in September 2019. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd is also set to return as the malevolent clown \u2014 one of It\u2019s favorite forms.\n\nSophia Lillis played the young Bev Marsh in the original, and she would also return for the sequel, performing new scenes as the character in flashback.\n\nThose who know King\u2019s book are aware that although Beverly survived her first encounter with Pennywise, and her abusive father, she carries with her deep, invisible wounds that have led her to another toxic relationship.\n\nAll of the Losers will have traumas that linger from their youth in Derry, and the resurrection of Pennywise serves as the catalyst for dealing with the more mundane monsters who plague them in adulthood.\n\nMuschietti talked about some of what to expect from Chapter 2 in this EW interview after the debut of It.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/episode-ix.jpg?crop=0px%2C174px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/df-08335_r3.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/qt9_17615_17604_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/crl13120r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/thelionking5d1a871db5457.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2745px%2C1442px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/beyonce-seth-rogen.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-lion-king.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mcdwhch_ec033.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/thelionking5c2f98925cc7b.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1161110573-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/regina-king.jpg", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/000015245.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/beyonce.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1158114520.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-flash.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/t423.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chastain-it.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/red-notice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C100px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chastain-it.jpg?crop=501px%2C37px%2C2167px%2C1139px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gigi-saul-guerrero.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1a7e274fd8c0a322815378f485c90474?s=300&d=blank&r=g"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/chastain-it.jpg?crop=501px%2C37px%2C2167px%2C1139px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anthony Breznican"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/02/20/jessica-chastain-it-sequel-stephen-king/", "title": "Jessica Chastain in talks to join sequel to Stephen King's It", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Jessica Chastain, Pennywise, It, Stephen King, bev, Beverly Marsh", "news_keywords": "Jessica Chastain, Pennywise, It, Stephen King, bev, Beverly Marsh", "description": "The actress would play the grown-up Bev Marsh as she returns to Derry to face Pennywise once again.", "og": {"title": "Jessica Chastain in talks to join sequel to Stephen King's 'It'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/02/20/jessica-chastain-it-sequel-stephen-king/", "description": "Beverly Marsh's hair is winter fire, January embers.
