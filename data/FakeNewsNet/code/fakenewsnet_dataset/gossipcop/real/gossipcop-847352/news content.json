Seacrest\u2019s move into the seat next to Ripa comes nearly a year after Ripa\u2019s former co-host, Michael Strahan, left the Disney-distributed show for an anchor slot on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,\u201d said Ripa in a statement. \u201cI am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at \u2018Live\u2019 to have him join the family. Ryan is a close friend and his star shines as brightly off camera as it does on. His tremendous success is only matched by his impeccable reputation. Plainly said, everyone loves him, and so will our daily viewers.\u201d\n\nThe move gives Seacrest, the multi-hyphenate host and entrepreneur, another big media platform. He will relocate from Los Angeles to New York for the \u201cLive\u201d gig, but will continue to host his syndicated daily drive-time radio show for L.A.\u2019s KIIS-FM and the weekly \u201cAmerican Top 40\u201d radio program. The plan is to build a radio studio for Seacrest at WABC-TV New York, where \u201cLive\u201d originates.\n\n\u201cNot only is Kelly Ripa one of the most talented live hosts in broadcast TV; she\u2019s also become a very dear friend to me over the years. It\u2019s consistently been my privilege and pleasure to work alongside Kelly with all her incredible talents, charm and humor,\u201d Seacrest said. \u201cI\u2019ve been so fortunate in my career to be a part of some incredible TV programs, and I\u2019m excited to join daytime\u2019s top entertainment talk show, and most important, I couldn\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather share this new chapter with than Kelly Ripa \u2013 she\u2019s a dream broadcast partner, and I can\u2019t wait to start.\u201d\n\nSeacrest served as a co-host with Ripa a few times during the past year, when \u201cLive\u201d had a steady stream of guest hosts while she took her time in selecting a permanent partner. His most recent stint on the show came on Feb. 27 with \u201cLive\u2019s\u201d annual post-Oscars edition. Seacrest will continue in his role as host and executive producer of E!\u2019s \u201cLive From the Red Carpet\u201d franchise, as well as his annual hosting gig on ABC\u2019s \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve.\u201d\n\nSeacrest\u2019s move to \u201cLive\u201d comes a year after the curtain fell on the show that made him a household name, Fox\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Over the years Seacrest has parlayed his success on air into a business empire that includes everything from investments in digital media startups (including DigiTour Media, Pinterest) and marketing/PR firms (Civic Entertainment Group) to a menswear line with Macy\u2019s and an upcoming line of skincare products, Polished by Dr. Lancer.\n\nRyan Seacrest Productions (RSP) is also a busy producer of scripted and unscripted TV series, notably E\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d and its many spinoffs, Bravo\u2019s \u201cShahs of Sunset\u201d and the NBC drama series \u201cShades of Blue,\u201d toplined by Jennifer Lopez. RSP will remain based in Los Angeles. The \u201cLive\u201d gig puts Seacrest squarely in business with each of the Big Four network parent companies. In addition to his deal with NBCUniversal\u2019s E!, RSP has an unscripted TV production pact with Fox\u2019s Endemol Shine North America and a scripted TV development deal with CBS Television Studios.\n\nMichael Gelman, the longtime exec producer of \u201cLive,\u201d called Seacrest \u201ca master of live TV\u201d with the experience and chops to handle chores of daily morning TV.\n\n\u201cWhen you combine those attributes with the talents and experience of the incomparable Kelly Ripa, you have two skilled and entertaining broadcasters, with great chemistry. Add in an experienced production team and a successful 30-year franchise and you have the perfect combination,\u201d Gelman said.\n\nGetting Seacrest in place is a bookend to the drama that ensued after Strahan made his move to \u201cGMA,\u201d which angered Ripa as she was left out of the loop on the planning. The show that bowed in the late 1980s with Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford at the helm has maintained its strong ratings during the past year thanks to Ripa. Seacrest\u2019s high-profile in TV and visibility in other media can only be an asset to \u201cLive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the secrets to \u2018Live\u2019s\u2019 decades of success in daytime is the relatability of our hosts and their ability to deeply connect with the audience,\u201d said Janice Marinelli, president of Disney/ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution. \u201cRyan has a charm and charisma that resonate with his devoted TV and radio audiences, and together, he and the remarkable Kelly Ripa will take \u2018Live\u2019 to a whole new level.\u201d", "images":
