I\u2019m very happy for Harry. They are both lucky to have found each each other and I am very excited about this new chapter in his life,\u201d he said.\n\nFigueras said Meghan had been excited to present the prize at today\u2019s match, joining a long list of royal ladies \u2014 including Diana, Princess of Wales \u2014 to hand out a polo trophy.\n\n\u201cShe said she enjoyed the game. She watched the game with my wife which was wonderful because she could learn more about the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was great that I got to play with Harry because we normally play against each other. Harry played great. They are very, very happy together.\u201d\n\nHis Royal Highness set up the charity after a gap year trip to the nation of Lesotho with Prince Seeiso, the younger brother of King Letsie III.\n\nThe event is held at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo club, where it has become an annual fixture.\n\nPrince Harry and his new wife Meghan will have fond memories of the area, having headed to Windsor to tie the knot in May.\n\nThe newlyweds attracted a crowd of thousands to their big day \u2014 with Meghan happily stepping into her new role as a royal.\n\nThe former American actress has embraced life as the Duchess of Sussex, attending a number of events already by her husband\u2019s side.\n\nShe has also stepped out on her own, heading to Cheshire with the Queen last month.\n\nMeghan has previously said she wanted to \u201chit the ground running\u201d in her role as a royal.\n\nShe recently joined her new husband in his work with the Royal Foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s just another step to welcome the 36-year-old into the Royal Family, with Meghan and her new husband Prince Harry already announced to be heading to Australia this autumn.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Sun and
