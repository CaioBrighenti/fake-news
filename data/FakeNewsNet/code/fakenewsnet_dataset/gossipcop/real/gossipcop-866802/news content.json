The conversation came to a head last week when two young girls were told they would not be able to board a United Airlines flight because they were wearing leggings. And the issue of whether or not to wear sneakers, though not likely to set off a viral news story, still tends to polarize. Leave it to frequent flyer Miranda Kerr, though, to override the debate with a look that combined the comfort of a legging and the elegance of a heel in one fell swoop.\n\nKerr touched down at Los Angeles International airport today in a tonal look that started from the ground up. She wore stirrup spandex boots by Balenciaga, a legging-like silhouette that extends from hip to toe for a smooth, seamless finish. The effect was a stylish step up from the stretchy sportswear that we\u2019re used to seeing at the airport\u2014and everywhere else, for that matter.\n\nKerr tucked a slim navy top into an Ala\u00efa miniskirt in the same shade. While a pencil skirt would have been impractical for travel, her fit-and-flare silhouette offered a more movement-friendly alternative that felt just as feminine. Plus, the laser-cut detail on the hem tied in with the floral embroidery covering the Samantha Thavasa shoulder bag swinging at her side. Kerr threw on a tailored overcoat in for good measure, because you never know when those cabin temperatures might take a dip.", "images": ["https://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e55859a315d21111f7baf1/16:9/pass/social-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e55859a315d21111f7baf1/16:9/pass/social-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Ward"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/miranda-kerr-airport-leggings-debate-celebrity-style", "title": "Miranda Kerr Has a Stylish Answer to the Airport Leggings Debate", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/miranda-kerr-airport-leggings-debate-celebrity-style", "title": "Miranda Kerr Has a Stylish Answer to the Airport Leggings Debate", "description": "Miranda Kerr\u2019s travel outfit was a stylish step up from the in-flight leggings-and-sneakers look.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e55859a315d21111f7baf1/16:9/pass/social-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "Miranda Kerr Has a Stylish Answer to the Airport Leggings Debate - Vogue", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58e55859a315d21111f7baf1/16:9/pass/social-miranda-kerr-celebrity-style.jpg"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Miranda Kerr\u2019s travel outfit was a stylish step up from the in-flight leggings-and-sneakers look."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=https://www.vogue.com/article/miranda-kerr-airport-leggings-debate-celebrity-style, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "description": "Miranda Kerr\u2019s travel outfit was a stylish step up from the in-flight leggings-and-sneakers look.", "keywords": "Celebrity Style,Fashion,Miranda Kerr,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Celebrity Style,Fashion,Miranda Kerr,mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Fashion", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491430591.865, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
