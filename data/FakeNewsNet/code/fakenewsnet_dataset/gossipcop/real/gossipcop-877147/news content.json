Kim revealed that she uses shaving-cream to remove makeup stains in a quick and easy way. She shared the advice on her app:\n\n\u201cJust apply to the stain and then lightly wet or wash. If the stain still won\u2019t come out, you can also use a drop of rubbing alcohol mixed with the shaving cream. The stain should lift out easily.\u201d\n\nSee more: Kim Kardashian on Trump\n\nKim Kardashian is a leader in the beauty community so it\u2019s not surprising that she has developed some tricks along the way. Our only question is how did she originally figure this out? She added that deodorant often leaves a stain of its own on your clothes:\n\n\u201cRubbing a clean pair of nylon stockings on a white deodorant stain will help it disappear.\u201d\n\nGenius.",
