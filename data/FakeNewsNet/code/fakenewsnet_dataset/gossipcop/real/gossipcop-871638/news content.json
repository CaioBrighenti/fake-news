It's also about protecting other planets and moons from our germs as we responsibly explore the Solar System,\" Dr. James L Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, wrote.\n\nGreen also wrote that he hopes Davis continues to study and do well in school, and hopes to see him at NASA in the future.\n\n", "images": ["https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/KVEA.png", "https://s.clickability.com/s?19=990&14=0&6=438703793&7=1222306&25=0&18=0.42830572746758433", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/nbc-ajax-loader.gif", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/logo_la_2x.png", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/images/tve-play-icon.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/designimages/us-world-v1.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=836588206435122&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/620*349/lastorm.jpg", "https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/ots-double-arrow.png", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/652*367/9-Year-Old_Applies_For_NASA_Job.jpg", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/designimages/ots_light_wx_85.png", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/jack+davis+nasa+letters.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/jack+davis+nasa+letters.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/NASA-Responds-to-9-Year-Old-Guardian-of-the-Galaxys-Job-Application-438703793.html", "title": "9-Year-Old 'Guardian of the Galaxy' Applies for NASA Job", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140, user-scalable=yes", "twitter": {"account_id": 17379685, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nbcla", "creator": "@nbcla", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/NASA-Responds-to-9-Year-Old-Guardian-of-the-Galaxys-Job-Application-438703793.html", "title": "9-Year-Old 'Guardian of the Galaxy' Applies for NASA Job", "description": "A self-proclaimed 'Guardian of the Galaxy' received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency.\n\nThis week, 9-year-old Jack Davis of New Jersey wrote a letter to...", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/jack+davis+nasa+letters.jpg?ak=bc"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361, "pages": 90240021027}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "A self-proclaimed 'Guardian of the Galaxy' received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency.\n\nThis week, 9-year-old Jack Davis of New Jersey wrote a letter to...", "title": "9-Year-Old 'Guardian of the Galaxy' Applies for NASA Job", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/NASA-Responds-to-9-Year-Old-Guardian-of-the-Galaxys-Job-Application-438703793.html", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/jack+davis+nasa+letters.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Universal,HTML5", "preferredFormats": "m3u,mpeg4,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "keywords": "nasa", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.description": "A self-proclaimed \"Guardian of the Galaxy\" received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency.\n\nThis week, 9-year-old Jack Davis of New Jersey wrote a letter to...", "description": "A self-proclaimed \"Guardian of the Galaxy\" received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency.\n\nThis week, 9-year-old Jack Davis of New Jersey wrote a letter to...", "sailthru.tags": "nasa", "news_keywords": "nasa", "sailthru.title": "9-Year-Old 'Guardian of the Galaxy' Applies for NASA Job", "title": "9-Year-Old 'Guardian of the Galaxy' Applies for NASA Job", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-05 07:08:56", "taboola_lead": "video"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501931336.0, "source": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com", "summary": ""}
