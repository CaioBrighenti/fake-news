And on the way back to the casino from my place, we got pulled over, we were in like a van, and we got pulled over by a deputy sheriff.\u201d\n\nBlake then explained that he and Kelly immediately launched into giving the cop a hard time. However, their behaviour stunned Adam, who was seriously concerned about their antics.\n\n\u201cNot that we don\u2019t respect the police but we knew we hadn\u2019t done anything wrong and so you can be a little cocky at that point,\u201d the 41-year-old smiled. \u201cAnd Adam didn\u2019t see it that way because Adam\u2019s from Los Angeles where you don\u2019t talk back to the police. And in Oklahoma, if you\u2019ve got a good point \u2013 you do sometimes. Especially Kelly, she was ribbing this guy (who) had a moustache that wasn\u2019t cool looking. And Adam was convinced we were going to jail and he got upset. I\u2019ll never forget it, (he was saying), \u2018Kelly shut up, Kelly shut up.\u2019 It got intense.\u201d", "images": ["https://postmediacalgarysun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/breaking-news-police-tape-surrounds-a-crime-scene-in-burnab1-2.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediacalgarysun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/0713_justin_trudeau_72653228-e1563045469689.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-459546982.jpg", "https://postmediacalgarysun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/breaking-news-police-tape-surrounds-a-crime-scene-in-burnab1-2.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://postmediacalgarysun.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/es_n1rea_ty0.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/990309138/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/94031519-e1563025246711.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/afp_1il74m-e1563025087512.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediacalgarysun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/0712-crash-web-sun-w.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/camila-cabello-e1562986526638.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://postmediacalgarysun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/72124240-jade_trico_3-w.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://postmediacalgarysun.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/calgary-desktop.png", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jfk8-1.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/25241bb6f3baefa544fc48ae2d9edaad?s=96&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-459546982.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["More Wenn - World Entertainment News Network"], "canonical_link": "https://canoe.com/entertainment/celebrity/how-blake-shelton-and-kelly-clarkson-made-adam-levine-cry", "title": "How Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson made Adam Levine cry", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson once made Adam Levine cry when they took some teasing too far.The three music stars currently work as coaches on U.S. TV singing show The Voice alongside Alicia Keys, but they&rsquo;ve actually all been pals for many years.", "news_keywords": "The Voice, Blake Shelton, Adam Levine, Kelly Clarkson", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "How Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson made Adam Levine cry", "url": "https://calgarysun.com/entertainment/celebrity/how-blake-shelton-and-kelly-clarkson-made-adam-levine-cry/wcm/7406b6ae-d592-405e-9075-514eb9af11d9", "description": "Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson once made Adam Levine cry when they took some teasing too far.The three music stars currently work as coaches on U.S. TV singing show The Voice alongside Alicia Key\u2026", "site_name": "Calgary Sun", "image": {"identifier": "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-459546982.jpg", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-20T15:43:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-20T15:43:33+00:00", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Calgary-Sun/131068450250444"}, "twitter": {"site": "@calgarysun", "text": {"title": "How Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson made Adam Levine cry"}, "image": "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-459546982.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson made Adam Levine cry", "description": "Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson once made Adam Levine cry when they took some teasing too far.The three music stars currently work as coaches on U."}, "stats-full-init": "0.014", "stats-postmedia_theme_pre_initialize": "0.000", "stats-initialize": "0.013", "stats-postmedia_theme_post_initialize": "0.000", "stats-vip_load_plugins": "0.001", "stats-load_plugins": "0.010", "stats-register_widgets": "0.001", "fb": {"pages": 204948363403036, "app_id": 204948363403036, "page_id": 131068450250444, "admins": 100002625504753}, "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-20 09:43:33", "sailthru.title": "How Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson made Adam Levine cry", "sailthru.tags": "brand-calgarysun, category-celebrity, Kelly Clarkson, Adam, Blake Shelton, Adam Levine cry, band Maroon 5, Alicia Keys, country musician, show The Voice, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Oklahoma, police, good point, show", "sailthru.description": "Blake Shelton and Kelly Clarkson once made Adam Levine cry when they took some teasing too far.
