And as the Key & Peele valets learned, if you wish hard enough for Neeson, he shall appear.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed Canada, the restaurant staff members, many Neeson aficionados among them, put the sign up early Tuesday, and by the afternoon, the action star had made an appearance.\n\nThe actor didn\u2019t take up the restaurant on their offer, but he did pose for a photo. We can only assume he was full on the tears of bad guys.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/toy-story-4_2.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/episode-ix.jpg?crop=0px%2C174px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bond25.jpg?crop=173px%2C9px%2C2349px%2C1233px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/eo_still_044.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/crl13120r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/charlies-angels1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hs_237328328923932.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1047855410.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mcdfaof_ec021.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-546682488.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/harry-met-sally-4-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C305px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/paradise-hills.jpg?crop=100px%2C0px%2C2800px%2C1470px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/rexfeatures_5878137e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5ef8613926fe5ac5d5623868eca6ee9f?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/aladdin5c60d65d98d1c.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/scary-stories.jpg?crop=328px%2C0px%2C2343px%2C1230.075px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kevin-smith-kevin-jason-mewes-jay.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/betty-gilpin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/michell-rodriguez-fast-and-furious-6.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/train-to-busan_still-cut-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C148px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/laemmle-ac-bull-durham-ns-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nivola.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-546682488.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-546682488.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Derek Lawrence"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/05/03/liam-neeson-sandwich-shop/", "title": "This sandwich shop offered Liam Neeson free food \u2014 and then he showed up to collect", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Liam Neeson, Big Star Sandwich, Taken", "news_keywords": "Liam Neeson, Big Star Sandwich, Taken", "description": "The Vancouver-area Big Star Sandwich scored a big-name guest.", "og": {"title": "This Sandwich Shop Offered Liam Neeson Free Food \u2014 And Then He Showed Up to Collect", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/05/03/liam-neeson-sandwich-shop/", "description": "He was 'Taken' by the offer", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-546682488.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/05/03/liam-neeson-sandwich-shop/", "description": "The Vancouver-area Big Star Sandwich scored a big-name guest.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-546682488.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/05/03/liam-neeson-sandwich-shop/", "title": "This Sandwich Shop Offered Liam Neeson Free Food \u2014 And Then He Showed Up to Collect", "description": "The Vancouver-area Big Star Sandwich scored a big-name guest.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-546682488.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493784000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
