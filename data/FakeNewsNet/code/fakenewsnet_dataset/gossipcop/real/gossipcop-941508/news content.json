The fashion designer was found dead in her New York City apartment on Tuesday, June 5, from an apparent suicide, Us Weekly confirms. Celebrities including Chelsea Clinton, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Bethenny Frankel took to social media to react to the news of the 55-year-old\u2019s death.\n\nO\u2019Donnell tweeted at Spade\u2019s brother-in-law, actor David Spade, writing, \u201c@DavidSpade \u2013 all my love to u dave.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy grandmother gave me my first Kate Spade bag when I was in college,\u201d Clinton tweeted. \u201cI still have it. Holding Kate\u2019s family, friends and loved ones in my heart.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City star, meanwhile, was one of the first celebrities to react, tweeting, \u201cPoor @katespadeny to be in so much pain. Success doesn\u2019t make you happy. True love & peace does.\u201d\n\nFellow designer Kenneth Cole wrote on Twitter: \u2018\u201cI believed that I could, so I did\u2019. She alone didn\u2019t change the handbag world but she was an inspiring accessory. #KateSpade #RIP.\u201d\n\nThe businesswoman was found \u201cunconscious and unresponsive\u201d at approximately 10:20 a.m. ET on Tuesday and pronounced dead at the scene, a New York Police Department PIO told Us.\n\n\u201cThe medical examiner will determine the cause of death, and the investigation is ongoing,\u201d the PIO added.\n\nSpade is survived by her husband, Andy Spade, whom she wed in 1994, and their 13-year-old daughter Frances. The couple launched Kate Spade New York in 1993. After the success of their initial handbag line, the brand expanded to clothing, shoes, eyewear, perfume, stationery and more accessories. After selling the company in 2007, she launched a new bag line in 2016 called Frances Valentine.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\n\nScroll through to see more celebrity reactions to Spade\u2019s death:\n\nAs \"unfussy\" as I am, I still loved my Kate Spade bags.
