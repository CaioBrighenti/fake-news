The Crazy Ex-Girlfriend actress and Emmy presenter showed up to the 2017 Emmy Awards looking drop-dead gorgeous in a stunning black Gucci gown\u2014and revealed on the red carpet that she not only bought the gown herself but also plans to resell the dress tomorrow online.\n\nWhile discussing the age-old topic of \u201cWho are you wearing?\" with red-carpet host Giuliana Rancic, Bloom revealed that she purchased the beautiful Gucci creation\u2014which features a V neckline, column silhouette, and intricate lace detailing\u2014herself, rather than having a designer lend her a gown, as many celebrities do. \u201cI bought this dress because Gucci is not lending me a dress,\u201d she revealed bluntly to Rancic, highlighting a decades-old problem within the fashion industry: Most designers lend out gowns that are runway sizes, which are typically a size 0 or 2. Most American women, however, are not those sizes.\n\nBloom continued to keep it real with Rancic, saying that \u201cit\u2019s OK\u201d that she had to shell out for her own dress (which retails for $3,500) since she can afford it and is planning on reselling it anyway. \u201cTake a look on The RealReal for this dress tomorrow,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nPinterest J. Merritt/Getty Images\n\nBloom\u2019s empowering and practical take on purchasing (and reselling) her own ensemble is certainly refreshing. And this is not the first time she\u2019s opened up about having to dress herself for red carpets before: Bloom previously revealed in an essay for Wealthsimple that she spends upward of $3,000 for her red-carpet looks.\n\n\u201cWhat has become apparent when I have to get clothes for these events is that I have a normal body,\u201d Bloom wrote at the time. \u201cA lot of fashion houses are reluctant to lend clothes that aren\u2019t in the sample sizes of 0 and 2, so it\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to find clothes without buying them... That\u2019s the whole problem with the fashion industry. My body size is literally normal and healthy, but when you put me next to a model, I look obese.\u201d\n\nBut the fashion industry\u2019s loss for not dressing an actress as gorgeous as Rachel Bloom is about to become the internet\u2019s win tomorrow when some lucky fashionista scores that Gucci gown for a steal.\n\nRETROspective: How the red carpet became the runway:", "images":
