We kindly ask that you respect our privacy during this time as we navigate the next phase of our lives.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Rebecca Gayheart and Actor Eric Dane with daughters Georgia and Billie Beatrice Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nGayheart and the former Grey\u2019s Anatomy star \u2014 he rose to fame as Dr. Mark Sloan in the ABC drama \u2014 have faced a number of challenges over the course of their relationship.\n\nIn 2009, an intimate video of Dane, Gayheart and another woman was released without their knowledge. Two years later, Dane entered into rehab for an addiction to painkillers following a sports injury.\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE in 2014, the actor said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all made mistakes. My one regret is that I got the person I love most wrapped up in all that: Rebecca.\u201d\n\nOf his family life, Dane said he feels happiest when he\u2019s at home with them.\n\n\u201cI never had a family, and now I do,\u201d he said, noting his father died when he was 7. \u201cI know I\u2019m a very lucky guy.\u201d", "images":
