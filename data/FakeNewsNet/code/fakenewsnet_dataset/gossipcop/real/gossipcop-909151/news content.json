And to celebrate the show\u2019s 20th anniversary James \u2013 who, you might remember, played lead character Dawson Leery \u2013 took to Instagram to post an epic throwback pic and reminisce about the show that \u2018changed our lives and launched our careers\u2019.\n\nAlongside a snap of himself, Katie, Joshua and Michelle, James wrote in the caption: \u2018#tbt Squad \u201897. I\u2019d known these people all of 7 days when this pic was taken. 20 years ago this week ? the little pilot we shot in that small town for that fledgling network aired, changed our lives and launched our careers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Thank you to the Wilmington, North Carolina crew and community who raised us & kept us sane, thank you to the many talented writers and producers who gave of your hearts talents and put up with us.\u2019\n\nJames, of course, thanks the fans that kept the show on the air for six season, and he also made a rather startling revelation \u2013 that he\u2019s never actually watched Dawson\u2019s Creek himself. For shame!\n\n\u2018And thank you especially to the fans of the show. It\u2019s a funny relationship we have\u2026 your experience of this project is what you saw on camera, while my memories are mostly what I experienced off of it.\n\n\u2018And yes, it\u2019s true that I haven\u2019t seen most episodes (it became healthier at a certain point to just commit 100% on the day and let it go completely), but the beauty of this arrangement is that my impression of the show now is what you\u2019ve all reflected back to me over the years\u2026 and it\u2019s been lovely to witness.\n\n\u2018So thank you to anyone who\u2019s ever expressed appreciation for the work we did \u2013 it makes me feel proud to be associated with these three fine people (and the rest of the cast), and proud to have been a part of #DawsonsCreek. This one will always have a special little place in my heart.\u2019\n\nAnd James isn\u2019t the only one who was feeling a bit nostalgic this week \u2013 Katie Holmes, AKA Joey Potter, also posted a sweet pic of her Dawson\u2019s Creek pilot script.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I am so grateful that 20 years ago we premiered Dawson\u2019s Creek,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018I am so honored to have been a part of it :) such wonderful memories. Such wonderful friends. Such incredible fans. Thank you all!\u2019\n\nThe very last episode of Dawson\u2019s Creek aired in May 2003 after six seasons. Fingers crossed they\u2019ll be on Netflix any day now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
