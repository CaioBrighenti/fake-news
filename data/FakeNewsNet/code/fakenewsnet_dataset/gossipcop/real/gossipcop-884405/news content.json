However, after the largest mass shooting in U.S. history occurred on October 1st at the Route 91 country music festival, the artist changed her plans, and Cyrus performed \u201cThe Climb\u201d on the show as a tribute to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting.\n\nWhen Fallon interviewed her, Cyrus explained why she chose to sing \u201cThe Climb\u201d for the first time in five or six years (not including her recent performance on Instagram Live). She cited the specific lyrics, \u201cThe struggles I\u2019m facing/The chances I\u2019m taking/Sometimes might knock me down, but/No, I\u2019m not breaking/I may not know it/But these are the moments that I\u2019m gonna remember most\u201d and told Fallon:\n\n\"The moments we're gonna remember most aren't being pulled apart by evil, but coming together through love.\"\n\nSo to close out the show, Cyrus sang \u201cThe Climb\u201d from Hannah Montana: The Movie to honor the victims of the Las Vegas shooting, which so far has resulted in nearly 60 deaths and over 500 casualties.\n\nAs she wrote on Instagram:\n\n\"In honor of the lives lost , injured and affected by the tragic shooting in Vegas, @fallontonight & I dedicated this show to not only mourning this horrific event but using this platform to encourage unity , peace & hopefulness! So we started this week off with a song I haven't performed in years ... #TheClimb . These words mean more now to me than ever ... \" Keep The Faith\" ..... Sending love to ALL! Enjoy the show tonight & #MileyWeek .... hope we can make you smile even thru so much pain \ud83d\udc9b @happyhippiefdn\n\nShe had also kicked off The Tonight Show by performing a cover of Dido\u2019s \u201cNo Freedom\u201d with Adam Sandler. Cyrus explained why the lyrics of that song particularly resonate with her in the aftermath of this shooting:\n\n\"When these tragic events happen, what is music if we can't go see our favorite artist perform because we're scared of violence? Or we're scared of losing someone that we love to go to a concert or to go see a film? And I think that right now, we're supposed to be the land of the free, but we can't have freedom if we're constantly living in fear.\"\n\n\"Never bow down to bullies, that's what my parents always said,\" she continued. \"And to stand up for what's right. And I think just constantly share hope instead of encouraging any more fear.\"\n\nLike many other musical artists, Cyrus spoke out about this horrific mass shooting \u2014 and she provided a positive message in these dark times.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12121550/aziz-ansari.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/08/15061655/picture-of-priyanka-chopra-engagement-ring-photo-e1562606368750.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02101219/couple-in-bed-e1562087559934.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12092117/Friends-Pottery-Barn.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01095134/Natural-Hair.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12070257/r-kelly-federal-charges-e1562940201720.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10114259/us-womens-national-team-e1562784596987.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02091156/Louis-Tomlinson.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02080120/aoc-border-patrol-facebook-e1562079691898.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/07/17235516/Sansa-e1541615562785.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11093957/camile-mendes-lucy-hale-new-e1562863206330.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072550/avatar-i-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27144916/police-car-e1561672307647.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/03112232/new-jersey-rape-case-e1562178162466.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/03101522/Emma-Portner-Justin-Bieber.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08101357/a-black-lady-sketch-show-e1562606101435.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10093023/hogwarts-harry-potter-e1562776277452.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11125306/kamala-harris-rape-kits-e1562874800780.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11071143/us-womens-soccer-espys-e1562854315128.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02092501/ama-abortion-laws-e1562084712895.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/03052117/MileyCyrus1.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09071547/amy-mcgrath-e1562681757171.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/03052117/MileyCyrus1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caitlin Gallagher"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/miley-cyrus-sings-the-climb-las-vegas-shooting-victims/", "title": "Miley Cyrus sings \"The Climb\" to honor Las Vegas shooting victims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Adam Sandler,hannah montana,jimmy fallon,las vegas,las vegas shooting,miley cyrus,the tonight show starring jimmy fallon", "news_keywords": "Adam Sandler,hannah montana,jimmy fallon,las vegas,las vegas shooting,miley cyrus,the tonight show starring jimmy fallon", "description": "Miley Cyrus beautifully sang \"The Climb\" on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" as a tribute to the Las Vegas shooting victims.", "og": {"title": "Miley Cyrus sings \"The Climb\" to honor Las Vegas shooting victims", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/miley-cyrus-sings-the-climb-las-vegas-shooting-victims/", "description": "It was a moving tribute.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/03052117/MileyCyrus1.jpg", "width": 565, "height": 882}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/miley-cyrus-sings-the-climb-las-vegas-shooting-victims/", "description": "Miley Cyrus beautifully sang \"The Climb\" on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" as a tribute to the Las Vegas shooting victims.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/03052117/MileyCyrus1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/miley-cyrus-sings-the-climb-las-vegas-shooting-victims/", "title": "Miley Cyrus sings \"The Climb\" to honor Las Vegas shooting victims", "description": "It was a moving tribute.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/03052117/MileyCyrus1.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/u6Jkv_K_nlk?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/agyTn10mW74?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0t3nMsjDLVM?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
