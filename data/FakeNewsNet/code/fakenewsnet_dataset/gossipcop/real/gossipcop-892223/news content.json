Inset: Getty\n\nActon told TMZ that she\u2019s selling because she\u2019s expecting a baby girl and plans to move to a new home with a guest house, where her parents can live. She\u2019s reportedly also relocating to the Miami area, where she\u2019ll look for an even larger house with about 10,000 additional square feet. (Kardashian and West\u2019s former home is 9,000 square feet.)\n\nImage zoom The Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman\n\nThe Altman Brothers were the listing agents on the property for the previous sale as well, which the couple sold for more than one-and-a-half times the price they originally paid for it \u2014 making it the most expensive home ever sold in Bel-Air Crest, according to the MLS.\n\nKardashian, 37, and West, 41, originally picked up the place in January 2013 for $11 million and did extensive renovations on it throughout the years.\n\nImage zoom Courtesy Douglas Elliman\n\n\u201cWhen they first bought this home, it had a very Mediterranean feel,\u201d Josh exclusively told PEOPLE at the time of the sale. \u201cNow, it\u2019s been transformed into a very modern, minimalist style, but so beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home features large automatic windows, a pool, and breathtaking views of L.A.\n\nImage zoom The Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman\n\nImage zoom Courtesy Douglas The Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman\n\nKardashian, West and their three children \u2014 North, 5, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 5 months \u2014 now reside in Hidden Hills, California, where they picked up a new mansion for a reported $20 million in 2014. Kardashian told PEOPLE at the time that she and her husband had \u201cjust found a new, amazing place\u201d nearer to her mom, Kris Jenner.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner Have a Girls Night Out at MTV Movie & TV Awards as Kylie Bails\n\n\u201cWhen we bought our Bel Air house, we didn\u2019t have a baby, we weren\u2019t even pregnant,\u201d Kardashian explained of the decision to find a new, larger home. The couple reportedly never lived in the completely overhauled home.\n\n\u201cAfter you have a baby, you realize that you need so many other things and a different kind of space,\u201d she said. \u201cSo being in the city is a different life. We wanted to be away and have more privacy.\u201d\n\nImage zoom X17online; Inset: Getty\n\nRELATED: Kanye West Posts Photos Inside $60M House As Kim Responds: \u2018We Had a Rule to Not Show Our Home\u2019\n\nThey moved into the Hidden Hills house in December 2017, despite ongoing renovations, in order to get settled before baby Chicago\u2019s arrival, a source confirmed to PEOPLE.\n\nThe new estate boasts 3.5 acres, two swimming pools, two spas and its own vineyard.
