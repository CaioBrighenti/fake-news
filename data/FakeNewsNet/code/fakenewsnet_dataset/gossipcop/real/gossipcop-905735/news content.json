In his 2011 autobiography, Late Late at Night, he talks about his history with the mental illness and his suicide attempt when he was 17.\n\nOn a more hopeful note, Springfield told Majewski that he is constantly taking steps to feel better: \u201cMediation is the only thing that takes me out of it. If I truly meditate and focus and get to that place, I\u2019m not depressed. No matter what\u2019s going on. But it\u2019s pretty hard.\u201d\n\nListen to the clip below.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/Rick-Springfield-morristown-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Rick-Springfield-morristown-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Rick-Springfield-morristown-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rania Aniftos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8094048/rick-springfield-considered-suicide-interview", "title": "Rick Springfield Says He Recently Considered Suicide in New Interview", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Rick Springfield Says He Recently Considered Suicide in New Interview", "description": "Fans have seen Rick Springfield rock out to his hit \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl\u201d countless times, but few have seen the darker side of the singer.", "og": {"title": "Rick Springfield Says He Recently Considered Suicide in New Interview", "description": "Fans have seen Rick Springfield rock out to his hit \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl\u201d countless times, but few have seen the darker side of the singer.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Rick-Springfield-morristown-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8094048/rick-springfield-considered-suicide-interview", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8094048/rick-springfield-considered-suicide-interview", "title": "Rick Springfield Says He Recently Considered Suicide in New Interview", "description": "Fans have seen Rick Springfield rock out to his hit \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl\u201d countless times, but few have seen the darker side of the singer.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Rick-Springfield-morristown-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
