But, I will not be one of those people. I cannot focus on the negative comments or indecently hateful words being said about me or my relationship even though they do sting. I do know great people that I care about deeply that comments and criticisms have affected and as a result I wanted to share my words. A small minority of people (at least I will continue to believe it is a small minority) want to see people suffer or fail. Personally, my basis for judging myself is simple, if I do something that doesn\u2019t represent Christ then I will listen to the opinions and words from family and friends who know me best and love me. I do desire (by the direction of family and peers) to become a better person daily. I know some will not agree with my intentions but in all things my pursuit is to represent Christ better. With that, I will once again clearly tell you I AM NOT PERFECT as none of us are and I have never claimed to be. I do desire to show love in all situations (do I always do that? No, I fail often). To be clear, not that this should be a surprise, but this podcast is a professional decision I have made to enhance my life and career. I still have a full time job. I am still running Generous Coffee company. I still have a blog. I am still actively involved in @humanityandhope. And now, because I was given the opportunity, I have added a podcast with a friend and a great company (@iheartradio) to talk about life (and I love to talk). The last few months have not gone the way I would have preferred. My relationships have changed drastically and what I envisioned my life was going to be has been redirected. It is sad, but it is nothing you should feel sorry for me about, life happens both the good and bad. With this, what do you think I should do now? For all of you that have given me advice let me give you some from my heart. Love as hard as you can (even to strangers). Ask yourself what life is about and pursue your conclusion with passion. When a good opportunity comes your way that fits your desires take it, because life is short but a lot more fun when you are doing something you enjoy.\n\nA post shared by Ben Higgins (@higgins.ben) on May 30, 2017 at 11:11am PDT", "images": ["https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557417.png", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557440.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1232984.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/assets/images/longroom_logo1.png", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1244778.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557461.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557422.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557439.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557419.jpg", "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017431/rs_600x600-170531203618-600-ben-higgins-mv-53117.jpg?downsize=450:*&crop=450:350;left,top", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1122836.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557452.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557431.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557416.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1232953.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557426.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1232964.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557447.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557458.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_Plage_de_W_C3_A9_Baie_de_Chateaubriand_Lifou.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557468.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1117582.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557437.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557429.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/uploads/stock/hm_1557430.jpg", "https://www.longroom.com/an_pw/piwik.php?action_name=nsrc_img&idsite=1&rec=1&bots=1"], "top_img": "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017431/rs_600x600-170531203618-600-ben-higgins-mv-53117.jpg?downsize=450:*&crop=450:350;left,top", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.longroom.com/discussion/510261/bachelor-nation-take-note-how-ben-higgins-is-handling-a-public-breakup-the-right-way", "title": "Bachelor Nation Take Note: How Ben Higgins Is Handling a Public Breakup the Right Way", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Long Room", "title": "Bachelor Nation Take Note: How Ben Higgins Is Handling a Public Breakup the Right Way", "url": "https://www.longroom.com/discussion/510261/bachelor-nation-take-note-how-ben-higgins-is-handling-a-public-breakup-the-right-way", "description": "pic.twitter.com/x27zKk3UTT\n\n\u2014 Benjamin Higgins (@benhiggi) May 21, 2017", "image": "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017431/rs_600x600-170531203618-600-ben-higgins-mv-53117.jpg?downsize=450:*&amp;crop=450:350;left,top"}, "referrer": "no-referrer"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.longroom.com", "summary": ""}
