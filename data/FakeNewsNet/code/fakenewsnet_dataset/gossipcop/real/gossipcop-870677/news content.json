Halle sat down with E! News recently and was very candid regarding her children as well as her career.\n\nWhen talking about her career and her children, she explained, \u201cIf I really set my mind to making change for my children, I can.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Berry and Jennifer Garner intended to get Congress to pass legislation that would prohibit photographers taking pictures of celebrity children.\n\nShe said, \u201cI never thought I could do that.\u201d\n\nAccording to Berry, other celebrities told her \u201cnot to do that.\u201d\n\nDedicating #KidnapMovie to my mothers, protectors, and fighters. Ready for the LA premiere tonight ?? In theaters August 4th! #FightlikeaMother A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry) on Jul 31, 2017 at 10:23am PDT\n\nThe bill was designed to increase fines up to $10,000 as well as prison time if they took pictures of the children of famous individuals.\n\nShe claims, \u201cI am strong enough to affect change.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t worry, Halle has concerns that are similar to a regular mother as well.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere are fears as a mom that I\u2019ll make a mistake.\u201d\n\nAccording to Halle, she is worried her children will have to go to therapy someday to talk about their problems, and she doesn\u2019t want to be the source of them!\n\n\u201cI hope that along the way I don\u2019t do anything that\u2019s too damaging to my children that they won\u2019t be able to deal with.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t help but notice that it\u2019s a strange thing to say, considering if you\u2019re a good mother you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about your children being traumatized by your behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite that, Halle is determined to be a good mother, and she is one. However, one way she intends to dictate the lives of her child is to persuade them not to go into acting. That\u2019s one vocation she\u2019s simply not willing to accept, for whatever reason. It managed to serve her well!", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/berrybailey-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toni-Braxton-300x169.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bilie-lee-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-RHOA-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Halle-Berry-.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kanye-West-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pauley-Perrette-Mark-Harmon-NCIS-300x195.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Kandi-Burruss-300x233.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Halle-Berry-BlogSpot.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-Donald-Trump-Nancy-Pelosi-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/keanu-reeves-graumans-chinese-theater-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Halle-Berry-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/halle-berry-reveals-her-biggest-worry-as-a-parent-56185/", "title": "Halle Berry Reveals Her Biggest Worry As A Parent", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "halle berry,", "keywords": "celebrity news, halle berry,", "description": "Even though Halle Berry is an Oscar-winning actress, she still has everyday worries that any mother would have!
