(Photo: CHARLES SYKES/INVISION/AP)\n\nNEW YORK \u2013 A year after morning news shows at CBS and NBC abruptly lost male anchors Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer in sexual misconduct scandals, the \u201cToday\u201d show has done appreciably better weathering the storm.\n\nMomentum at \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d the most buzzworthy morning show for a handful of years, stopped dead with Rose\u2019s firing. Last week CBS announced the exit of Ryan Kadro, the show\u2019s top executive who had worked there since its 2012 launch, leaving an uncertain future.\n\n\u201cToday\u201d is hardly problem-free \u2013 remember Megyn Kelly? \u2013 but it has the steadiest audience of all three network morning shows. The elevation of Hoda Kotb into Lauer\u2019s role is widely perceived as a winner.\n\nRose lost his job in November 2017 following allegations of improper behavior with women who had worked with him. Lauer\u2019s downfall, also due to reports of inappropriate relationships with women, came less than two weeks later.\n\nThe NBC show currently averages 4 million viewers a morning, a 3 percent drop from 2017 before Lauer\u2019s exit, the Nielsen company said. CBS has lost 10 percent of its audience in the same period, to just under 3.2 million. ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d the first-place broadcast with 4.1 million viewers, lost 5 percent of its audience.\n\nThe long history of \u201cToday\u201d likely helps it absorb hits. The show launched in 1952 and while it has had missteps \u2013 it has never recovered the dominance it enjoyed prior to the ham-fisted departure of Ann Curry a decade ago \u2013 \u201cToday\u201d viewers can be confident it will be around tomorrow.\n\nMore: A year after Lauer firing, ex-reporter calls out NBC; Comcast says she's wrong\n\n\u201cIt just has the strongest DNA out of all the morning shows,\u201d said Shelley Ross, who produced rivals at ABC and CBS.\n\nFor much of the past half-century, CBS has been an after-thought in the mornings, a distant third-place broadcast that changed names, formats and personalities as often as an impatient designer changes paint. That\u2019s what made \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d so encouraging; with a newsy emphasis, it gained a larger share of the audience in the morning and was now competitive in a lucrative marketplace.\n\nRose, a skillful interviewer who moonlighted on both \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and his own PBS show, teamed with Gayle King and Norah O\u2019Donnell.\n\nIn retrospect, Rose seemed more important to the success and chemistry of his show at the time than Lauer did. Rose was replaced by former \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John Dickerson and, in October, Bianna Golodryga was added as a fourth anchor.\n\nLauer spent two decades as \u201cToday\u201d co-host, and in his heyday with Katie Couric was part of the most successful anchor team in morning show history. But his reputation took a significant hit with the Curry drama and he wasn\u2019t as popular at the end of his run.\n\n\u201cThere was concern when Matt Lauer left that they would be hurt more than turned out to be the case,\u201d said Garth Tiedje, an analyst and senior vice president at Horizon Media.\n\nIn fact, Kotb earned the permanent job beside Savannah Guthrie after \u201cToday\u201d did unexpectedly well in the ratings when she was an emergency fill-in. Kotb\u2019s \u201cQ\u201d score, a statistical measure of her popularity, is strong among women \u2013 who make up the bulk of morning news show audiences \u2013 and more than doubles Lauer\u2019s last score among older women, according to Marketing Evaluations, Inc.\n\n\u201cEverybody loves Hoda,\u201d Ross said. \u201cShe\u2019s a magical part of the equation.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean everything is sunshine and flowers at \u201cToday,\u201d which has to be concerned about an erosion of younger women viewers. In the second week of December, its audience among 18-to-49-year-old viewers was down 23 percent compared to the same week in 2017, Nielsen said. It faces questions about its third hour following Kelly\u2019s departure, and the fourth after Kathie Lee Gifford said she was leaving the show. NBC declined to comment.\n\nThe \u201cToday\u201d show executive producer, Libby Leist, was appointed to her job in January.\n\nFor all morning shows, the fact that more people wake up with a hand-held computer on their nightstands in addition to a television remote is ultimately a bigger concern than anchors who have lost their jobs.\n\nIn the days following Kadro\u2019s departure, CBS dealt with damaging news stories suggesting that King was unhappy and considering leaving, and that networks were mulling a top-to-bottom renovation. The network declined comment on the reports or ratings, but said its newsy emphasis remains intact now and for the future.\n\nThe danger in responding to ratings weakness with big changes is that it could play into a narrative of CBS being less able than its rivals of being able to settle on one type of morning show for the long term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always hard to fight against the pull of history if it\u2019s a long trajectory,\u201d Tiedje said. \u201cBut I also think that shouldn\u2019t cloud the decisions that need to be made for the future.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/12/21/today-show-cbs-morning-matt-lauer-scandal-hoda-kotb-charlie-rose/2385815002/", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-nav-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5005.62.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2efdce2caa2dd51bdca21e8acf095bf507dc0acd/c=0-275-5393-3322/local/-/media/2018/06/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636657191775000217-Day004.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/usatoday/usat-web-static-5005.62.0/images/indicators/facebook-loading.gif", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/site-masthead-logo-dark@2x.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b14667c886f15dbfd41bb0bb42f6d6fdcea066fc/c=111-0-4899-3600/local/-/media/2018/06/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636657191775000217-Day004.JPG?width=534&height=401&fit=crop"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2efdce2caa2dd51bdca21e8acf095bf507dc0acd/c=0-275-5393-3322/local/-/media/2018/06/27/USATODAY/USATODAY/636657191775000217-Day004.JPG?width=3200&height=1680&fit=crop", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published A.M.
