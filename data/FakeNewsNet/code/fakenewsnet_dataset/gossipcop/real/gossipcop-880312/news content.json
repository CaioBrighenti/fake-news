Adds Geyer: \u201cI thought I\u2019d already seen Jillian at her most gorgeous, but her in that dress walking down the aisle took the meaning of hot to the next level!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jana Williams Photography\n\nThe Glee and Australian Idol alum, 31, and the Code Black actress, 33, met on the set of their film Never Back Down 2 seven years ago. \u201cFrom the beginning, I knew I liked her,\u201d says Geyer. Now after nearly a decade together, \u201cwe share the same beliefs, countless interests and passions.\u201d\n\nMurray and Geyer are self-proclaimed \u201cfoodies\u201d and splurged on fresh ingredients and a decadent menu by Field to Table catering. \u201cWe\u2019re taking things from the garden we\u2019re getting married in and actually cooking it for the guests,\u201d says Murray, who kicked off the cocktail hour with bacon-wrapped dates, truffle mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese and grilled cheese dippers with tomato soup.\n\nImage zoom Jillian Murray\n\nFor dessert, the couple are serving chocolate chip cookies and three different wedding cakes (including butterscotch, cookie dough and brownie) by Enjoy Cupcakes.\n\nThe pair\u2019s reception featured designs by Rrivre Davies of Rrivre Works, and the overall theme was \u201csuper glamorous in nature,\u201d says Murray. \u201cThe vision I had on my Pinterest, he found a way to blend it. He\u2019s literally the reason I have the wedding of my dreams.\u201d\n\nDecor for the big day (planned by Lindsay Longacre of LVL Weddings) featured a custom-made structure with chandeliers, all-white flowers and greenery (by Precious & Blooming) and a custom-furnished lounge section for their guests to relax. The couple served cocktails by On the Rocks and hired Bella Vista for lighting.\n\n\u201cWe wanted it to be open so you can see the stars and appreciate where you are out in the middle of nowhere,\u201d says Geyer.\n\nFROM PEN: All about Drew Scott and Linda Phan\u2019s destination wedding \u2013 guess where they\u2019re tying the knot?\n\nGeyer (in a Hugo Boss tuxedo and bowtie) did not see his new bride until she walked down the aisle to live music by the Santa Barbara String Quartet. \u201cShe wants the waterworks!\u201d joked the actor before the ceremony. Murray kept her gown \u2014 which was her \u201cbiggest splurge\u201d for the wedding \u2014 under wraps for months.\n\n\u201cI saw the dress and I started crying. It wasn\u2019t even on me yet,\u201d she said of picking it out. \u201cThis was obviously the one.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/john-schneider-5.jpg",
