Did you ever not know?\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI'm not gonna stop, that's who I am\n\nI'll give it all I got, that is my plan\n\nWill I find what I lost? You know you can\n\nBet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)\n\nI want to make it right, that is the way\n\nTo turn my life around, today is the day\n\nAm I the type of guy who means what I say?\n\nBet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nHow will I know if there's a path worth taking?\n\nShould I question every move I make?\n\nWith all I've lost, my heart is breaking\n\nI don't wanna make the same mistake\n\n\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\n\n(Did you ever) doubt your dream will ever come true?\n\n(Did you ever) blame the world, but never blame you?\n\n(I will never) try to live a lie again\n\nI don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI'm not gonna stop, that's who I am\n\nI'll give it all I got, that is my plan\n\nWill I find what I lost? You know you can\n\nBet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)\n\nI want to make it right, that is the way\n\nTo turn my life around, today is the day\n\nAm I the type of guy who means what I say?\n\nBet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it\n\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nOh, hold up\n\nGive me room to think, bring it on down\n\nGotta work on my swing, gotta do my own thing\n\nOh, hold up\n\nIt's no good at all to see yourself and not recognize your face\n\nOut on my own, it's such a scary place (Ooh)\n\nThe answers are all inside of me\n\nAll I gotta do is believe\n\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nI'm not gonna stop, not gonna stop till I get my shot\n\nThat's who I am, that is my plan, will I end up on top? You can\n\nBet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on, you can\n\nBet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it (Bet on me)\n\nI want to make it right, that is the way\n\nTo turn my life around, today is the day\n\nAm I the type of guy who means what I say?\n\nBet on it, bet on it, bet on it, bet on it\n\nYou can bet on me", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-f3CPQ6vHckedE.gif", "https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/220x224/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2F86e91ede597377d792e07d258a18e3c7.884x900x1.jpg", "http://images.genius.com/86e91ede597377d792e07d258a18e3c7.884x900x1.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17151659&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/64x66/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2F86e91ede597377d792e07d258a18e3c7.884x900x1.jpg", "https://loadus.exelator.com/load/?g=4&j=0&p=1183&page-album_ids=%5B326625%5D%2C%5B375921%5D&page-album_in_top_10=false&page-albums=High+School+Musical+2%2CRadio+Disney+Jams%2C+Vol.+10&page-artist_ids=%5B184927%5D%2C%5B373988%5D&page-artist_in_top_10=false&page-artists=Zac+Efron%2CHigh+School+Musical+Cast&page-genre_ids=%5B1173%5D%2C%5B886%5D%2C%5B16%5D&page-genres=Disney%2CSoundtrack%2CPop+Genius&page-in_top_10=false&page-new_release=false&page-release_decade=2000&page-release_month=200708&page-release_year=2007&page-type=song&user_signed_in=false", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=201983886890479&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "http://images.genius.com/86e91ede597377d792e07d258a18e3c7.884x900x1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://genius.com/High-school-musical-cast-bet-on-it-lyrics", "title": "High School Musical Cast \u2013 Bet On It Lyrics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=709482991", "y_key": "f63347d284f184b0", "og": {"site_name": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/High-school-musical-cast-bet-on-it-lyrics", "type": "music.song", "title": "High\u00a0School Musical Cast (Ft.\u00a0Zac\u00a0Efron) \u2013 Bet On It", "description": "\u201cBet On It\u201d peaked at #46 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk9yEyO9djg", "image": "http://images.genius.com/86e91ede597377d792e07d258a18e3c7.884x900x1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 265539304824, "pages": 308252472676410}, "twitter": {"url": "https://genius.com/High-school-musical-cast-bet-on-it-lyrics", "type": "music.song", "title": "High\u00a0School Musical Cast (Ft.\u00a0Zac\u00a0Efron) \u2013 Bet On It", "description": "\u201cBet On It\u201d peaked at #46 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lk9yEyO9djg", "image": "http://images.genius.com/86e91ede597377d792e07d258a18e3c7.884x900x1.jpg", "site": "@Genius", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Genius"}, "id": {"iphone": 709482991}, "url": {"iphone": "genius://songs/440886"}}}, "description": "Bet On It Lyrics: Everybody's always talking at me / Everybody's trying to get in my head / I want to listen to my own heart talking / I need to count on my self instead / (Did you ever) lose", "newrelic-resource-path": "/songs/440886"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://genius.com", "summary": ""}
