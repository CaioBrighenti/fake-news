{"url": "https://people.com/celebrity/busy-philipps-money-instagram-ads-acting/", "text": "Image zoom Araya Diaz/Getty\n\nBusy Philipps is getting honest about her money.\n\nThe 37-year-old actress opened up about her income in a Thursday Instagram Story, revealing that she made more money last year doing brand sponsorships than through acting.\n\nAfter someone said that they liked Philipps\u2019 Instagram because she wasn\u2019t always posting #spon like some other celebrities, the actress revealed that she \u201cwasn\u2019t above it\u201d and had done sponsored content in the past \u2014 but only for brands she actually liked.\n\n\u201cI gotta be honest with you, I didn\u2019t make a ton of money as an actor last year,\u201d Philipps said. \u201cI made more money doing that kind of stuff, like the partnerships with brands.\u201d\n\nIt is common for celebrities to promote brands on the photo-sharing site. Stars like Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Lea Michele, Bella Hadid and more have gotten in on the action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not above it, guys,\u201d Philipps said in the clip. \u201cI just only choose things that I genuinely like and, like, would want to partner with, like, for instance, my Michaels partnership, which, you know, is my favorite thing of all time. And I\u2019m doing one next week, I think, that feels like me.\u201d\n\nBusy Philipps Describes Her \u2018Freaking Creepy\u2019 Uber Scare\n\nThe mother-of-two\u2018s Instagram account has several posts promoting the arts and crafts retail chain along with Campbell\u2019s Soup and more.\n\nHowever, she noted in the video that she likely wouldn\u2019t promote a product that she deemed \u201crandom and weird\u201d \u2014 \u201cUnless it was, like, a billion dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna sell things,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s my only point.\u201d\n\nPhilipps currently plays Gale Liptrapp in HBO\u2019s Vice Principals and last year made appearances on New Girl and Angie Tribeca.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly said that Philipps said she made money off of Instagram ads, not brand partnerships in general. This post has been updated to correct that error.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630",
