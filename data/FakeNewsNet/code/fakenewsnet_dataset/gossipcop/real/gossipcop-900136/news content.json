In two separate videos, the Biebs spun and flipped to Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u201cPerfect.\u201d\n\nThe slow, romantic tune doesn\u2019t exactly lend itself to any extreme moves, but Bieber looked very passionate as he tried out his interpretive moves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna get this dance thing down,\u201d he captioned one of the clips.\n\nBack in August, Bieber cancelled the remaining 12 dates of his Purpose tour, penning a heartfelt message to his fans.\n\n\"Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE.. I want my career to be sustainable, but I also want my mind heart and soul to be sustainable. So that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be and the father I want to be,\" he wrote. \"This message is just an opportunity for you to know my heart, I'm not expecting anyone to understand, but I do want people to have an opportunity to know where I am coming from!\"\n\nTwo months later, Bieber and his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Selena Gomez, reunited and have been going strong ever since.\n\n\"Selena is 100 percent the reason Justin turned his life around,\" a source recently told ET. \u201cJustin wants to be a better man because he doesn't want to screw things up with Selena. He knows he's lucky to have this second chance and he's not taking it for granted. And the truth is, this 'transformation' hasn't been all that difficult for him because he wants it.\"\n\nFor more on the couple, watch the clip below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMORE: Justin Bieber Wants to Be a 'Better Man' for Selena Gomez, Source Says\n\nMORE: Justin Bieber's Mom Talks 'Special Bond' With Selena Gomez: 'I Love Her'\n\nMORE: Justin Bieber Posts Heartfelt Message to His Dad: 'Relationships Are Worth Fighting For'\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-12/justin_bieber_gettyimages_630752492_0.jpg?itok=NXDQ-Wkd&h=35887d92", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161760651.jpg?itok=MLRyG4zA&h=bd7808dd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2015-10/justin_bieber_1280.jpg?itok=wv4pL8Vc", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/justin_bieber_gettyimages_630752492_0.jpg?itok=IdbIvkTJ", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/street-style-outfit-nordstrom-anniversary-sale-1280.jpg?itok=eyAT2Bws&h=e6a33408"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/justin_bieber_gettyimages_630752492_0.jpg?itok=IdbIvkTJ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/justin-bieber-works-his-dance-moves-ed-sheerans-perfect-watch-92694", "title": "Justin Bieber Works on His Dance Moves to Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u2018Perfect\u2019: Watch!", "meta_data": {"title": "Justin Bieber Works on His Dance Moves to Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u2018Perfect\u2019: Watch!  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/justin-bieber-works-his-dance-moves-ed-sheerans-perfect-watch-92694", "title": "Justin Bieber Works on His Dance Moves to Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u2018Perfect\u2019: Watch!", "description": "He shared the videos on Instagram on Wednesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/justin_bieber_gettyimages_630752492_0.jpg?itok=IdbIvkTJ", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "He shared the videos on Instagram on Wednesday.", "title": "Justin Bieber Works on His Dance Moves to Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u2018Perfect\u2019: Watch!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Rachel McRady\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/justin-bieber-works-his-dance-moves-ed-sheerans-perfect-watch-92694", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/justin_bieber_gettyimages_630752492_0.jpg?itok=IdbIvkTJ"}, "description": "He shared the videos on Instagram on Wednesday.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
