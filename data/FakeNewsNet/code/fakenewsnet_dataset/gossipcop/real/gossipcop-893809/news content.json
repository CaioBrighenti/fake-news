K thanks.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Sarah Hyland Likes Working Out Naked in the Mirror so \u2018You Hate Yourself and Work Harder\u2019\n\nIn August, Hyland, who suffers complications from her kidney dysplasia, clapped back at several online trolls who accused her of being too skinny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading some of your DMs and so many of you are like, \u2018Girl, you fine but like, eat some bread!\u2019 So I would like to put in a request for anyone who is concerned about my bread consumption to send to Wells Adams, because he is the sole person who knows about how much bread I consume on a daily basis. Thanks! Love you, mean it, k bye,\u201d she said in her Instagram Story.\n\nAnd Adams verified that Hyland loves bread, adding, \u201cJust saw Sarah\u2019s story. Apparently there are concerns about how much bread she eats. I can vouch for her that she truly is \u2014 she\u2019s not a carnivore, she\u2019s a carbivore.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Sarah Hyland Excited to Get Back to the Gym After Hospitalization: \u2018Strong > Skinny\u2019\n\nImage zoom Sarah Hyland and Wells Adams Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nThough Hyland has been criticized in the past by social media users for looking too thin, their body-shaming a constant source of frustration for the actress, she tweeted in May that she wants to build muscle.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t had the greatest year. Maybe one day I\u2019ll talk about it but for now, I\u2019d like my privacy. I will say that this year has brought a lot of changes and with that, physical changes,\u201d Hyland wrote. \u201cI have been told that I can\u2019t work out. Which, for me, is very upsetting. I love to be STRONG \u2026 Strength is everything. Being strong has gotten me where I am. Both mentally and physically. I am not a fan of \u2018being skinny.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd despite fighting off the negative comments from critics, she\u2019s never been happier in her relationship with Adams, especially since moving in together in August.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s brought us closer. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been long enough to discover pet peeves with each other,\u201d Hyland told PEOPLE recently about their romance. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the honeymoon phase of living together. It\u2019s good that nothing is already starting, because then I think that would be a bad sign,\u201d she said.", "images":
