After keeping it under wraps for a few months, Girls Trip star Tiffany Haddish told GQ the story of how she witnessed an anonymous actress take a bite at Beyonce's face at a party in December. As expected, Mrs. Carter played it cool, but Haddish -- and an army of extremely loyal fans -- are furious.\n\nThe Cut and Vulture both conducted investigations in attempts to expose the teethy culprit. Model-turned-90210-star Sara Foster was one of the names in question. Foster quickly denied the accusations via her Instagram, on which she captioned a screenshot of an email requesting comment on the matter: \"Flattering that anyone thinks I could get this close to Beyonce\"\n\n\n\nAnother suspect was Sanaa Lathan, best known for her role in Love & Basketball. She also shot down the rumors on her social media, tweeting that if she ever felt compelled to lay a tooth on Beyonce, \"it wouldv'e been a love bite.\"\n\nY\u2019all are funny. Under no circumstances did I bite Beyonce and if I did it would\u2019ve been a love bite -- \u2014 Sanaa Lathan (@justsanaa) March 26, 2018\n\n\n\nFans weren't so quick to be convinced. Many of them responded with bee emojis as a proclamation of their alliance to Queen B. This case is yet to be cracked, but with countless Sherlocks in the Beyhive ready to serve justice, the offender may just be caught faster than you can say \"lemonade.\"", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/media/beyonce-tidal-2017-jkls-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/beyonce-tidal-2017-jkls-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/beyonce-tidal-2017-jkls-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8262686/beyonce-sara-foster-sanaa-lathan-deny-biting-tiffany-haddish-interview", "title": "Sara Foster and Sanaa Lathan Shut Down Rumors of Biting Beyonce: 'Y'all Are Funny'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Sara Foster and Sanaa Lathan Shut Down Rumors of Biting Beyonce: 'Y'all Are Funny'", "description": "The Beyhive is determined to solve the whodunit mystery of who bit Beyonce at a party in December.
