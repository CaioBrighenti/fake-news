Kevin Federline and Britney Spears attend the Sony/BMG Grammys afterparty on Feb. 8, 2006. After months of back and forth, a formal court filing, intense pressure and behind-the-scenes negotiations, Britney Spears and Kevin Federline have reached a new agreement concerning child support for their sons, Sean Preston, 13, and Jayden James, 12.\n\n\n\nAccording to a new report from The Blast, Britney and Kevin just settled out of court -- and everyone's happy with their new agreement.\n\nKevin had been getting $20,000 a month in child support for the last decade. But back in February, K-Fed and his lawyer launched a campaign to convince the pop star, who divorced him in 2007, to pay him more support for the boys since she makes far more money these days than she was earning at the time of their split as she struggled with mental health issues. In May, Kevin filed court papers formally requesting an increase.\n\nSources close to the negotiations tell The Blast that Britney's lawyer, Laura Wasser, and Kevin's lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, ultimately hashed out a deal that will pay Kevin \"thousands more a month\" in child support, The Blast writes, noting that \"several other items\" are also a part of the new deal, though the specific terms of their agreement are confidential.\n\nA judge recently ordered Britney to pay Kevin $100,000 to cover his legal fees amid their negotiations too.\n\nMy kids are growing up so fast. Kaleb just hit 14 and is going to be a beast. Kori\u2019s gonna be 16 in 2 days. The time goes so fast. I love this squad so much.

Kevin, who works as a DJ these days and earns about $3,000 a month, told the court in May, The Blast reported, that his income \"has changed significantly since the child support was last modified in approximately 2008 because I no longer earn a six-figure income like I did in 2008. I am no longer able to perform as a dancer due to my age, and I have not been as successful in putting out new music as I was in 2008. I am simply less of a 'name' and less in demand than I was in 2008, which has negatively affected my income.\"\n\nBritney launched her \"Piece of Me\" residency at Planet Hollywood's AXIS Theater in December 2013 and the show grossed an estimated $130 million during its four-year, nearly 250-show run, Billboard reported. Her next Vegas show, an upcoming two-year residency at the Park Theater at The Park MGM, is expected to earn her nearly $500,000 per show.\n\nLove when we go to our favorite spot on Sundays \ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udd5e The boys are bigger than me now!!!!! \ud83d\ude1c A post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on May 29, 2018 at 12:59pm PDT\n\nBritney had also long been paying for the boys' private school tuition and extracurricular activities. Mail Online reports that those expenses totalled about $15K per month.\n\nIt's been reported that these days, the pop star and Kevin have custody of their sons for roughly the same amount of time, though Preston and Jayden spent extra time with their mom over the summer while she was on tour. \"[Kevin] knows it's better for her when they're on the road with her,\" an insider told Us Weekly.\n\nRelated slideshow: Celebs and their cute kids in 2018:", "images": ["https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAEf190.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=805&y=805", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyjFEd.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAEfbhy.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=1412&y=1075", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZjjB.img?h=17&w=0&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&f=png", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZjjB.img?h=100&w=100&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=f&l=f", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyjAuh.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=c846df1252b443329579a3833f3676fe&rnd=636986437365469251&rf=&tp=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmusic%252Fcelebrity%252Fbritney-spears-kevin-federline-settle-child-support-case%252Far-AAAzJHb&di=509&lng=en-us&activityId=c846df1252b443329579a3833f3676fe&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&st.dpt=music-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=music&pg.n=articlevnext&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&aadState=0", "https://static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/82/c22c7d.gif", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBCFOve.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBQdmDZ.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1482&y=1092", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAsZMRM.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAAzH7N.img?h=425&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1140&y=707", "https://static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/57/a49b8d.gif", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZ6og.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=509&pi=&ps=&su=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmusic%252Fcelebrity%252Fbritney-spears-kevin-federline-settle-child-support-case%252Far-AAAzJHb&mkt=en-us&pp=False&cv.partner=Wonderwall&cv.publcat=Whalerock%2BIndustries&st.dpt=music-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636986437365469251&rf=&rid=c846df1252b443329579a3833f3676fe&cvs=Browser&subcvs=music&cv.entityId=AAAzJHb&cv.entitySrc=ar&provid=AA5HhRQ&ar=0&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=&isCorePV=&pgIdx=&pgTot=&activityId=c846df1252b443329579a3833f3676fe&pm=&pg.n=articlevnext&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&ex=&aadState=0", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&cs_ucfr=1&rn=636986437365469251&c7=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmusic%252Fcelebrity%252Fbritney-spears-kevin-federline-settle-child-support-case%252Far-AAAzJHb&c8=&c9=", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAEfiso.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=505&y=145"], "top_img": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAAzH7N.img?h=425&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1140&y=707", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wonderwall.com/news/britney-spears-kevin-federline-settle-child-support-case-3016533.article", "title": "Britney Spears, Kevin Federline settle child support case", "meta_data": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Britney Spears, Kevin Federline settle child support case", "cq": "passed", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Both sides have agreed to new terms that see K-Fed getting thousands more per month to care for their two boys, claims a new report.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.msn.com", "summary": ""}
