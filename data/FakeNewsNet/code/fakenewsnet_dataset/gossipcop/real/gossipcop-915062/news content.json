We focus on pretty much everything but readings,\u201d he added.\n\nImage zoom Tyler Henry/Instagram\n\nRELATED: Why Hollywood Medium\u2019s Tyler Henry Says Connecting with Michael Jackson Was \u2018Really Humbling\u2019\n\nHenry previously opened up to PEOPLE about how one of the goals of his television show is to break down some of the misconceptions people have about mediums and the accuracy of their readings.\n\n\u201cI totally understand skepticism, and I think it\u2019s so important for me to show validation of my readings,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s a big reason behind all of this \u2014 I really feel like there are a lot of misconceptions behind mediums and what we do. I hope to kind of revolutionize and kind of rewrite a lot of what people think of when they think of mediums.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can work with skeptics \u2014 cynics are a little bit harder because they already have their mind made up,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that I\u2019m going to say that\u2019s going to change that. And I also understand that I can\u2019t help everybody. I just try to help the people I can.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ed-sheeran.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mr-mrs-jonas-2-1200x630.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/js_vinnypauly.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tiatamera1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyler-henry.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/louie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/olivia-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/zoe.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/pauly-d-nikki.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/junior3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/thorragnarok5902c1880ce09.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-802901548.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/60249169_167306667604571_7810577565342118619_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C169px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kelly-ripa-father-joseph.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2585px%2C1357.125px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyler-henry.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/workout_233.jpg?crop=0px%2C2279px%2C5037px%2C2647px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/ariana-grande-2-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1288px%2C677px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-rock-throwback.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/netflix_thewitcher_ig-grid_phase001_1080x1080_pre_06.jpg?crop=0px%2C102px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/strangerdavid.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/jenelle-evans.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/daisy.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tyler-henry.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/tyler-henry-boyfriends-dead-grandfather-played-their-matchmaker/", "title": "Love Connection!
