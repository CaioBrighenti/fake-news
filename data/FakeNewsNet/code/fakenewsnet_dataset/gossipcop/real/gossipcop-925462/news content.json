You have to ask her that \u2014 I\u2019m not gonna speak for her,\u201d the 30-year-old said on a recent episode of her podcast, It\u2019s Happening With Snooki & Joey. \u201cBut Sammi is just in such a happy place that I feel like she doesn\u2019t want to jump back into that drama if it does happen. And being that there was a lot of Ron and Sam drama when we did film, it was just really hard on both of them. So I just think she doesn\u2019t want that anymore.\u201d\n\nGiancola and Ortiz-Magro met when they first headed to Seaside Heights, New Jersey, as the first members of the show in 2009. The ups and downs of their relationship were documented over the following seasons, until the duo officially called it quits in 2014.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jersey Shore Is Back With a \u2018Family Vacation\u2019 But One Original Cast Member Is Not Joining Them\n\nGiancola, 30, was part of the the group\u2019s recent road trip reunion, though Ortiz-Magro sat the special event out.\n\nAlthough it seems that Giancola is defintely out for the new series, Polizzi is hanging on to hope that she\u2019ll change her mind.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019re just like, it\u2019s gonna be different. We\u2019re all begging her to come back on the show. It\u2019s really up to her,\u201d the podcast host said. \u201cEveryone pray that Sammi comes back, because I feel like she might change her mind. So Sam, if you\u2019re listening, come to the show. Like, stop being \u2014 stop it. Stop it right now before I spank you.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jersey Shore Cast MTV\n\nWHERE\u2019S THE BEACH?!
