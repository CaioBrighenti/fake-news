A caller asked the singer and actress which episodes of the popular show had been her favorite \u2014 and least favorite \u2014 to film, and the star responded with some behind-the-scenes scoop.\n\n\n\n\"My favorite episode to shoot was the first time we ever went to New York, so I think it was the last episode of Season 1,\" she revealed. \"It was so fun, coming from New York and then getting to go back to my hometown.\" As for her least favorite episode, here's a hint: Thriller.\n\n\"The Michael Jackson episode was really hard to shoot,\" the actress spilled. \"I think we felt a lot of pressure to make it super great, and to recreate a lot of those numbers. I think that was just because we wanted it to be so good. And I think at 4 a.m. one [morning] Amber [Patrice Riley] and I walked off set because we were so tired.\"\n\nLea Michele also opened up about one of her famous co-stars. A caller reminded the actress that she'd kissed John Stamos on Scream Queens, and asked exactly how good that kiss was.
