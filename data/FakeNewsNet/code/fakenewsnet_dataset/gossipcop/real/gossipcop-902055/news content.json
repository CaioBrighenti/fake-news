The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.\n\nAlthough it is William and Kate\u2019s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.\n\nIt is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate\u2019s parents\u2019 hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.\n\nKate\u2019s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.\n\nThere will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family\u2019s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons\u2019 traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the \u201cFab Four,\u201d will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.\n\nIt was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a \u201cmole hunt\u201d to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.\n\nSince then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don\u2019t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry\u2019s relationship with Meghan was moving.\n\nThe Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n\u2014 We took a closer look at that \u201cHurricane Meghan\u201d rumor\n\n\u2014 Sugarplum fairyland gets high tech in Atlanta\u2019s newfangled Nutcracker\n\n\u2014 Is drama rising between Harry and William?\n\n\u2014 Wilco\u2019s Jeff Tweedy is not so sure about this\n\n\u2014 Meghan Markle-inspired holiday gifts!\n\nLooking for more?
