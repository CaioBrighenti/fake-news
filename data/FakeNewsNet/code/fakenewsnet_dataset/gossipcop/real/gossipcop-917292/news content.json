Viewed now, Cyrus, 25, says the controversial performance did more than help jettison her child star image (and introduce the concept of \u201ctwerking\u201d to a wider demographic) \u2014 it helped her grow up.\n\n\u201cNot only was culture changed, but my life and career were changed forever,\u201d she says in a revealing interview for Wonderland magazine\u2019s spring 2018 issue. \u201cIt inspired me to use my platform for something much bigger. If the world is going to focus on me and what I am doing, then what I am doing should be impactful and it should be great.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Miley Cyrus in Wonderland Ellen von Unwerth\n\nIn the intervening years, Cyrus has become a passionate advocate for the LGBTQ and homeless communities through her Happy Hippie Foundation, a nonprofit organization established to fight \u201cinjustice for vulnerable populations.\u201d The year after her provocative duet with Thicke, she arrived at the 2014 VMAs with a young homeless man named Jesse Helt, transforming a red carpet walk into a spotlight on American youth shelters.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Miley Cyrus\u2019 Fun Family Farm Weekend\n\nImage zoom Miley Cyrus covers Wonderland Ellen von Unwerth\n\nWhile she initially earned fame for her acting talent in the aforementioned Disney Channel hit, plus breakout roles in feature films like The Last Song \u2014where she first met on-again-off-again fianc\u00e9 Liam Hemsworth \u2014 Cyrus admits that the static and sometimes tedious process of filmmaking isn\u2019t for her these days.\n\n\u201cMy attention span doesn\u2019t love the idea of focusing and being on one project for so many months, especially being a character and not getting to be myself for that amount of time,\u201d she says. \u201cI get really deep into the characters I play, just like I do with music. So then it becomes hard for me to relate \u2014 even to my family and friends \u2014 I\u2019m so deep into that character. So for right now, I am so content with where I am, being someone else doesn\u2019t sound that fun to me.\u201d\n\nPre-order your copy online at http://www.wonderlandshop.com.", "images":
