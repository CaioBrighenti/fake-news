File Photo by James Atoa/UPI | License Photo\n\nOct. 3 (UPI) -- Christina Grimmie's family is reaching out to those affected by the mass shooting in Las Vegas this week.\n\nThe late singer's family offered support and understanding in a statement Monday after 59 were killed and hundreds injured when, police say, Stephen Paddock opened fire on an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas strip Oct. 1.\n\n\"We are beyond devastated to hear of last night's tragedy in Las Vegas,\" the statement reads. \"Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to all the victims and the family and friends of those who were taken last night. We truly understand what these families are experiencing and hope to help in some way.\"\n\nGrimmie, who rose to fame on NBC's The Voice, died at age 22 in June 2016 after she was shot by Kevin James Loibl after her concert in Orlando, Fla. Her family established The Christina Grimmie Foundation after her death \"to provide financial, emotional and encouragement support to individuals and families who suffer from the devastating effects of gun violence.\"\n\n\"The Foundation is committed to helping impacted families experience the same type of love and support Christina Grimmie's family experienced from friends, family and the community at large when faced with the shock of losing their precious daughter to gun violence,\" according to the foundation's website.\n\nThe mass shooting that killed 49 at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., occurred days after Grimmie's death. The attack was the deadliest modern mass shooting by a single gunman in the U.S. until the events in Las Vegas this week.", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/related/7641562765490/2/v1.2/e35c017ccbc056d1fff2d90614170088/upi/Beyonce-Donald-Glover-attend-The-Lion-King-premiere.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/expand_gallery.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15071286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4621562907259/2019/upi/24864105aebfdedab071cd61925fb4dc/v1.5/R-Kelly-faces-federal-kidnapping-child-sex-racketeering-charges.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7191562865263/2019/upi/dd7c8c20a88724f042688075dfb2e55c/v1.5/Christine-Baranskis-Good-Fight-moves-from-streaming-to-network.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7061562941093/2019/upi/1cbd640a40d4930c5f604f7bcb58e1de/v1.5/Miley-Cyrus-on-her-unique-and-modern-marriage-Its-so-complex.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4691562947708/2019/upi/93608c5b7949951fad4700562606e8f1/v1.5/Oprah-Winfrey-opens-private-road-to-help-Maui-fire-evacuations.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/3061507038947/2017/1/9b23382a21b069cdb616634a76189392/Christina-Grimmies-family-reaches-out-after-Las-Vegas-shooting.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-hqtKxhsRLFLuJ.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/3061507038947/2017/1/9b23382a21b069cdb616634a76189392/v1.5/Christina-Grimmies-family-reaches-out-after-Las-Vegas-shooting.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4681562806918/2019/upi/7d34b7058efe6e8ed05d554e532ad4b3/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-July-13-Ken-Jeong-Patrick-Stewart.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/3061507038947/2017/1/9b23382a21b069cdb616634a76189392/v1.5/Christina-Grimmies-family-reaches-out-after-Las-Vegas-shooting.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2017/10/03/Christina-Grimmies-family-reaches-out-after-Las-Vegas-shooting/3061507038947/", "title": "Christina Grimmie's family reaches out after Las Vegas shooting", "meta_data": {"description": "Christina Grimmie's family offered support and understanding after 59 were killed and hundreds injured in a mass shooting on the Las Vegas strip.", "keywords": "Entertainment, Music, Kevin James", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Music, Kevin James", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Christina Grimmie's family offered support and understanding after 59 were killed and hundreds injured in a mass shooting on the Las Vegas strip.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2017/10/03/Christina-Grimmies-family-reaches-out-after-Las-Vegas-shooting/3061507038947/", "title": "Christina Grimmie's family reaches out after Las Vegas shooting", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/3061507038947/2017/1/9b23382a21b069cdb616634a76189392/v1.5/Christina-Grimmies-family-reaches-out-after-Las-Vegas-shooting.jpg", "width": 490, "height": 325}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "creator": "@littlemannie", "title": "Christina Grimmie's family reaches out after Las Vegas shooting", "description": "Christina Grimmie's family offered support and understanding after 59 were killed and hundreds injured in a mass shooting on the Las Vegas strip.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3061507038947/2017/upi/9b23382a21b069cdb616634a76189392/v2.1/Christina-Grimmies-family-reaches-out-after-Las-Vegas-shooting.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
