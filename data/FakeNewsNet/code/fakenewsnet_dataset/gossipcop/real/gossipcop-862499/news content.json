He experienced hallucinations, delusions, depression, and mania\".\n\nHe continued, \"It is a very severe mental illness that usually requires a lifetime of treatment. It is not well studied, so the treatment is largely an estimation based on schizophrenia and bipolar treatments. Hank was diagnosed in August of 2008.\"\n\nAfter starring in 1989's Ghostbusters II, Hank went on to run a martial arts school and appeared in the 2017 documentary, Cleanin' Up the Town: Remembering Ghostbusters.\n\n\n\nThe twins opened up a martial arts school.\n\nWilliam stressed how much the illness changed his brother in the years since his diagnosis.\n\n\"The side effects of the medication took a toll on Hank,\" William wrote. \"He felt like a zombie, lost his personality, gained weight quickly, slept for twelve hours a day, and had to use all of his willpower just to lift his hand to drink a cup of water.\"\n\nBut, he concluded, he wants to make sure the world remembers his brother in the best way:\n\n\"His family will remember him as someone who was always there when they needed him. His nieces and nephews will remember him as the funnest uncle who was always ready to play. His close friends will remember how he always helped them look for the silver lining. His students will remember him as a mentor, in martial arts and in life. His girlfriend will remember him as someone who made her feel like the most important person in the world. I will remember him as my best friend, my partner, my brother, and the bravest man I have ever known.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, please reach out to Lifeline at 13 11 14 or visit lifeline.org.au for crisis support chat.", "images": ["https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/7Oi9P7WlLBNFJ_lalVDFFwFcd90=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F05%2F29%2F08%2F34%2Ffooter-creative-146x82.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/-e5WZWAABLC9lJxzFRDLebH_9fo=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F07%2F09%2F13%2F05%2Ftherookfooter.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/DikTfSa5UuzVlQ7nBUEpTZCL9fM=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F08%2Ffinderbluergb1800x427--new-footer-revised.png", "http://prod.static9.net.au/_/media/Network/Images/2017/06/22/10/27/Hank.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/UBQoT5_6dxQmfFiamNeGeA49Aos=/88x88/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F9bb0611d-e84c-4f4a-a9cc-63a5388f136a", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/vlKtby2o8QlBsxpLvcT3xbyzmHQ=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F04%2F17%2F11%2F24%2F146x82.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/9zTejye347pZ35MA-1KzlJs1Mn0=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F04%2Fstan_lockup_blue_rgb-copy.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/5KzbMsOop5CF24PIrLPdiW9I2mA=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F03%2Fninecouponsblue.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/BTwKo0O1jSbzFzPHov6lnTqU1fI=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F24%2Fdomain_partner_module_lrg.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Bty3AwvHIvMUJImS9vTIVRhOd5A=/396x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2F2017%2F06%2F22%2F10%2F27%2FTwins2.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/3oDMNxaN29E9MRCxr8OiAG3E9lo=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F09%2F01%2F10%2F23%2Fnational.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/jlYEcEIGLGoyZXLEr8MoDoxRpVk=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F07%2F09%2F13%2F35%2Fladbrokresred--revised.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Uw8TvDi-X70Rjya-t-CSyyVEgZk=/0x22/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F07%2F09%2F13%2F44%2Fmybudgetlogogooglelarge.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/flJRTFnrQETXOghx_cREWmE58UI=/396x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F06%2F22%2F10%2F39%2FGhostbusters2.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/n8mcSioAMzxrzpEGbdR6y2LZBMQ=/396x223/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2017%2F09%2F06%2F13%2F23%2Fliarliarfix0609_2.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/CGE2hJsy-7k21ygJqjmmbSJbhCo=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F05%2F01%2F10%2F17%2Ffooter--february-25th-2019.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/C4boa_SOuCEE0_90Fp2y_19s78Q=/140x0/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F07%2F09%2F12%2F59%2F146x82_nine_partnership_banner_no_text.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/dARnglbRcuS7azK40LZC4uRSZns=/480x270/smart/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2F2017%2F06%2F22%2F10%2F27%2FHank.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/cmHyh41wOzLnShw7QA1DoZJnZnY=/88x88/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fa50432c4-1fac-41ad-bd2e-bf10bd8716c9", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/glHWrK5FCDVlMJuVMC6zXEPmjj0=/88x88/http%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fea2f7f26-8030-434c-b76b-9e89669d9d43"], "top_img": "http://prod.static9.net.au/_/media/Network/Images/2017/06/22/10/27/Hank.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/ghostbusters-ii-hank-deutschendorf-death/b85c92e2-04b1-44b8-bc1f-8bb29a68b8a0", "title": "Ghostbusters II child star Hank Deutschendorf found dead at 29", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00daa7", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/imgs/thefix/ms-icon-144x144.f93a8f07.png", "theme-color": "#00daa7", "nine": {"video-player": {"nielsen-plugin": "{\"apid\":\"P366BEB07-2E11-4EE0-B65B-0E24519B7560\",\"sfcode\":\"dcr\",\"nsdkv\":\"511,\",\"apn\":\"nineFix\",\"section\":\"nine.com.au Honey -
