When Jen tells him their Las Vegas home was robbed overnight while she and their infant daughter Ariana were asleep, he immediately insists she leave with the baby.\n\n\u201cGet the f\u2014 out of the house and go to the other house. Why would you stay there?\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not making sense right now. If they come back, what are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you please leave now?\u201d he begs. \u201cBecause now you have me f\u2014ing scared and I\u2019m halfway around the country.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jen Harley/Instagram\n\nBut while Ronnie stresses over the situation, his roommates, listening in on the call from across the room, are more suspicious.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Not for one second,\u201d Pauly \u201cDJ Pauly D\u201d DelVecchio whispers. \u201cJen is up to no good. Because the last time I talked to Ronnie, he had blocked her and I think she\u2019s just doing this to get Ronnie to talk to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s lying, this girl,\u201d Angelina Pivarnick alleges. \u201cThis girl is so vindictive. She\u2019s so evil. It\u2019s not even funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she can make up something like this, that\u2019s scary,\u201d Deena Cortese adds.\n\nMike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino says he\u2019s completely \u201cbefuddled.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis whole situation with Jen is crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a calamity or crisis once a week, like clockwork.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jersey Shore Cast Gave Ronnie \u2018Tough Love\u2019 During Drama with On-Off Girlfriend: \u2018It Was Hard\u2019\n\nThe MTV stars previously told PEOPLE Now that Ronnie\u2019s explosive, on-off relationship with the mother of his child can be challenging for the whole cast.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see me giving him a little bit of tough love,\u201d Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley said ahead of the season premiere. \u201cIt just stems from, honestly, love. We love him, we want the best for him. Sometimes when people are in it, they don\u2019t realize what it\u2019s like looking from the outside in. You\u2019ve kind of got to wake that person up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was hard on us, too,\u201d Mike said. \u201cBecause we were trying to support him in this difficult situation that he was in and at certain times we didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe still wanted to enjoy our vacation, too, you know!\u201d Pauly added. \u201cBut what\u2019s dope about our show is people go through what he\u2019s going through and you get to actually live it, see it, breathe it with us. You get to see how we handle it, how he handles it, how we help him and how we\u2019re there for our brother.\u201d\n\nThe season finale of Jersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on MTV, followed by Floribama Shore at 9 p.m.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/jenni-farley.jpg",
