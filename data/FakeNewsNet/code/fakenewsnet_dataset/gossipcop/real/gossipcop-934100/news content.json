The 48-year-old entertainer and Fallon competed against each other to see who could better \"fast dance\" to slow songs from the '70s.\n\nAll picked by The Roots' Questlove, the two took turns busting moves to the least danceable jams with the best fastest dancer winning. Dressed in a body-hugging red gown with sequins and a thigh-high slit, J.Lo took the stage first and danced to \"Three Times a Lady\" by Commodores and then to Richard Harris' \"MacArthur Park.\"\n\nOn his end, Fallon shimmied to \"Babe\" by Styx. Naturally, the World of Dance judge proved that no matter what song was chosen, she couldn't be bested!\n\nWatch the epic dance-off below, which also featured a hilarious duet.\n\nET caught up with Lopez and her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez, at Monday's glamorous Met Gala, where they dished about their time together since their public debut.\n\nRodriguez called the year \u201cawesome,\u201d while Lopez agreed, saying it had been an \u201camazing year.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below to hear more of what they shared.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJennifer Lopez Says She'd Want a 'More Intimate' Proposal Than One on the Red Carpet\n\nJennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez Reflect on 'Amazing' Year Since Their Met Gala Debut (Exclusive)\n\nJennifer Lopez Shows Off Her Toned Abs While Out in Miami With Boyfriend Alex Rodriguez\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2015-07/640_jennifer_lopez_gma_150723_450932852.jpg?itok=sz4d2Icg", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161760651.jpg?itok=MLRyG4zA&h=bd7808dd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-05/jennifer_lopez_nbc.jpg?itok=w0jASYvN&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/street-style-outfit-nordstrom-anniversary-sale-1280.jpg?itok=eyAT2Bws&h=e6a33408", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/jennifer_lopez_nbc.jpg?itok=Kr1Yjmj2"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/jennifer_lopez_nbc.jpg?itok=Kr1Yjmj2", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-lopez-hilariously-fast-dances-to-undanceable-70s-slow-jams-watch-101989", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Hilariously Fast Dances to Undanceable '70s Slow Jams -- Watch", "meta_data": {"title": "Jennifer Lopez Hilariously Fast Dances to Undanceable '70s Slow Jams -- Watch | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-lopez-hilariously-fast-dances-to-undanceable-70s-slow-jams-watch-101989", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Hilariously Fast Dances to Undanceable '70s Slow Jams -- Watch", "description": "The 'El Anillo' singer appeared on Wednesday's episode of 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.'", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/jennifer_lopez_nbc.jpg?itok=Kr1Yjmj2", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 'El Anillo' singer appeared on Wednesday's episode of 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.'", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Hilariously Fast Dances to Undanceable '70s Slow Jams -- Watch", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Liz Calvario\u200d \u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-lopez-hilariously-fast-dances-to-undanceable-70s-slow-jams-watch-101989", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/jennifer_lopez_nbc.jpg?itok=Kr1Yjmj2"}, "description": "The 'El Anillo' singer appeared on Wednesday's episode of 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.'", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, TV, Music, News, Jennifer Lopez, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, TV, Music, News, Jennifer Lopez, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/R9YYmoJjBxI?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
