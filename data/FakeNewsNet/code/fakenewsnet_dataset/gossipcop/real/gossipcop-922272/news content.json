And when we go through these things together as a family, I realize, these are the important things, these are the important moments.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhatever some tabloid printed means nothing, money doesn\u2019t mean anything, work is great \u2013 I work so that I can take care of my family \u2013 but the family is the most important thing.\u201d", "images":
