I never could have imagined how much it would grow and transform, and I\u2019m so grateful for those of you that have purchased pieces since the brand\u2019s inception. From the shipments that you expect to see every month to capsules like my LC Runway collection, I have had the time of my life creating and designing it all for you. As of now my LC Lauren Conrad line has expanded to include everything from apparel, accessories, and home d\u00e9cor. That being said, it can be tricky to navigate the entire collection so I thought I\u2019d share 10 of my favorite pieces with you today. From cozy, season appropriate picks to classic staples, let me walk you through it all. Keep scrolling to snag my faves\u2026\n\n1. Feather Crew Socks, $8\n\nGoing back to the basics with this pick. These super soft and comfy socks are a perfect winter staple and come in a handful of lovely colors.\n\n2. Plush Scuff Slippers, $28\n\nWalking on clouds has never looked so cute! These plush slippers are my favorite to wear around the house, no matter the season.\n\n3. Cactus Ring Holder Trinket Tray, $24\n\nIf you have bits and baubles floating around your vanity, keep them safe in a trinket tray like this one. The color combination on this cactus ring holder is my favorite.\n\n4. Dear Ankle Boots, $69.99\n\nBooties are back, and these ones take the cake in my closet. The low heel and scallop detail are two reasons why these boots are on heavy rotation for me.\n\n5. Feel Good Super Skinny Midrise Jeans, $50\n\nSince I redesigned my denim collection, I have been wearing these midrise jeans nonstop. They have just the right amount of stretch and won\u2019t look baggy by the end of the day.\n\n6. Cable-Knit Beanie, $30\n\nCozy up or give this sweet cable knit beanie as a gift this holiday season. My favorite is the blush, but it comes in a few different colors as well.\n\n7. Faux Mongolian Fur Throw, $49.99\n\nThere\u2019s nothing better than settling in with a soft blanket. This faux fur throw is heavy enough to keep you warm and is easily the softest blanket in my collection.\n\n8. Cropped Jean Jacket, $50\n\nEveryone needs a denim jacket in their arsenal. My new cropped jean jacket comes in different washes, making it difficult to pick a fave!\n\n9. Abby Solid Backpack, $69\n\nBackpacks are back, ladies. This one is big enough to hold all of your necessities without feeling bulky.\n\n10. Cable-Knit Crop Sweater, $50\n\nYou may recognize this sweater from my Redbook spread, and it\u2019s still easily one of my go-to pieces. You can bet I\u2019ll be wearing it well into next year.\n\nWhich one of these pieces is your favorite?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts in the comments!\n\nXO Lauren\n\nShop This Story\u2026\n\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content\n\nAffiliate links may have been used in this post.", "images": ["https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/themes/laurenconrad-2016/images/ui/closeNav.png", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/7.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/excerpt-2.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/9.png", "https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/03802256d770f5590f4a3f55c7794590/5DA9F735/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/66490129_454186325313714_4441675665897144292_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d83d09515261ab7839c917aa6670ed42/5DA16230/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/65392538_2402814413331037_3596586405841598850_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4d323e8e291148dba5234ec38268507c/5DA6D767/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/66651923_160218098474523_5595662955616339030_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/themes/laurenconrad-2016/images/ui/search.png", "https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c2d77945f8c655c90475c48529ff2c53/5DB156EA/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/66652537_126880228555073_4653230481699032743_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Excerpt4-150x150.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/JamesAllenSale1.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/10.png", "https://assets.rewardstyle.com/images/search/350.gif", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/themes/laurenconrad-2016/images/branding/mobileMasthead.png", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/themes/laurenconrad-2016/images/ui/hamNav.png", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Excerpt-5-150x150.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/8.png", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/4.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/excerpt.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/6.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Excerpt-3-136x126.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/excerpt-17.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excerpt-8.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/excerpt-27-150x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=483981518417542&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/excerpt-2-150x150.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5.jpg", "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/themes/laurenconrad-2016/images/branding/siteMasthead.png"], "top_img": "https://laurenconrad.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Excerpt-3-136x126.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://laurenconrad.com/blog/2018/11/tuesday-ten-my-10-favorite-pieces-from-my-lc-lauren-conrad-line/", "title": "Tuesday Ten: My 10 Favorite Pieces from My LC Lauren Conrad Line", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Tuesday Ten: My 10 Favorite Pieces from My LC Lauren Conrad Line -
