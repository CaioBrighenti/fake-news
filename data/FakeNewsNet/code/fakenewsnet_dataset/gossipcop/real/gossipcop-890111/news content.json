After initially waving her off and telling her to \u201cgo away,\u201d he reluctantly agrees to answer her question.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like to direct Hello Dolly and Meteor Shower,\u201d Schumer asks. (The theaters where both of the Broadway shows \u2014 which are actually both directed by Zaks \u2014 are located right next to each other.)\n\n\u201cOh Amy,\u201d he says while laughing. \u201cI\u2019ma love you. I\u2019ma love you.\u201d\n\nSchumer captioned the photo, \u201cI love our director Jerry Zaks very much. He probably needs a lil break from me tho.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amy Schumer Buys $2,000 Mattress for Store Employee Who Let Her Use the Bathroom\n\nSchumer will be joined by an all-star cast,
