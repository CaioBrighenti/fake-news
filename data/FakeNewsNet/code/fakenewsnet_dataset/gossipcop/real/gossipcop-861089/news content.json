If you have sensitive lips, avoid ingredients like artificial colors, fragrances, menthol, and camphor.\n\nDrink A lot Of Water\n\nStaying hydrated is key for soft, supple skin and lips so make sure you drink at least eight glasses of water a day. It is also essential to maintain a healthy diet. Omega-3 fatty acids are amazing when it comes to keeping your skin hydrated.\n\nUse Sugar To Exfoliate Dry, Peeling Lips\n\nSugar is a natural humectant, and a DIY exfoliating scrub made of sugar and honey is a great option to get rid of dead skin cells on your lips. Exfoliation also helps you reap all the benefits of your lip balm more intensely as the formula is absorbed into your lips with ease.\n\nApply Your Lip Balm Outside Of Your Lip Line As Well\n\nThe peripheral area around your lips tends to dry out more easily. So, dab your lip balm outside the natural line of your lips as well. You can do this every night and notice how your lips heal.\n\nDon\u2019t Pick At Your Lips If They Are Flaky\n\nIf you have dry lips, you need to stop licking them and picking at them. This will make them more dehydrated and can lead to bleeding and cold sores.\n\nYou can also use oils like extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil to create a lip mask for your pout when it is in need of some extra hydration. It is best to avoid matte lipsticks when you are trying to banish the dryness. Stick to a tinted lip balm instead. That was our roundup of the top 20 lips balms for dry lips.
