She has a little rap for you recapping the entire first season, and it\u2019s epic.\n\nDuring her appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d on Oct. 31, host Jimmy Fallon remembered he made the young actress rap to Nicki Minaj the last time she was on the show. This time, Brown said she\u2019d rap again, but only if she could do a recap of the first season.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to Indiana, circa Nineteen Eighty-Three/ Just four boys in the basement chillin\u2019 playin\u2019 D&D/ There was Lucas there was Willy Will and Dustin, there was Mike/ But one night Will goes missing while he\u2019s riding on his bike \u2013 yikes,\u201d Brown raps.\n\nSee Videos: Watch 'Stranger Things' Chief Hopper Dance to Your Favorite Songs\n\nAnd yes, the \u201cStranger Things\u201d star also raps about Eleven\u2019s love for Eggo waffles, and even mentions the blasted Demogorgon, Dr. Brenner and Joyce \u2014 and her obsession with Christmas lights.\n\n\u201cAll I need is my Eggo waffles, I\u2019m in love with those/ What I\u2019m left with when I use my powers is a bloody nose,\u201d she quips, before dropping the mic and walking off stage.\n\nAlso Read: Sexy 'Stranger Things' Eleven Halloween Costume Sparks Backlash: 'It's Literally a Child'\n\nThe second season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d premiered last week. It also stars David Harbour, Winona Ryder, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer and Joe Keery.\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spider-man-far-from-home-DF-06693_r.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fast-and-furious-every-car-ranked-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sam-raimi-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anita-160x105.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-5.59.05-PM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MillieBobbyBrown.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Barb-Stranger-Things-Dead-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/stranger-things-max-sadie-sink-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/envelope.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/stranger-things-2-character-ranked-split.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SpiderMan-Zendaya-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/stranger-things-2-movie-references-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CMS_EW_061919_Comedy618x742-1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070919_Whitman_Quibi_1092px.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1153289783-1-e1562700127279.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2F5A0156.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MillieBobbyBrown.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Phil Hornshaw", "Phil Owen", "Umberto Gonzalez", "Jeremy Fuster", "Thom Geier", "Ross A.
