She is currently the co-host of Today with Hoda & Jenna, the fourth hour of NBC's morning news program Today.\n\nHager and her twin sister, Barbara, are daughters of the 43rd U.S. President George W. Bush and former First Lady Laura Bush. They are the first and only twin children of a U.S. president.\n\nAfter her father's presidency, Hager became an author, an editor-at-large for Southern Living magazine, and a television personality on NBC, being featured most prominently as a member of The Today Show as a correspondent, contributor and co-host.[2]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nJenna (left) and Barbara Bush with their parents in 1990\n\nHager was born at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Texas,[1] and named after her maternal grandmother, Jenna Hawkins Welch.[3] While living in Dallas, she and her sister attended Preston Hollow Elementary School and then The Hockaday School. In 1994, after her father was elected Governor of Texas and the family moved to Austin, Texas, Bush was a student at St. Andrew's Episcopal School, and attended Austin High School from 1996 until her graduation in 2000.[4]\n\nWith her father becoming President in 2001, she attended the University of Texas at Austin and took summer classes at New York University. She was a legacy member of Kappa Alpha Theta, her mother's sorority. While there, Jenna and her sister Barbara made national headlines when they were both arrested for alcohol-related charges twice within 5 weeks: on April 29, 2001, Jenna was charged with a misdemeanor for possession of alcohol under the age of 21 in Austin. On May 29, 2001, Jenna was charged with another misdemeanor \u2014 attempting to use a fake ID (with the name \"Barbara Pierce,\" her paternal grandmother's maiden name) to purchase alcohol. She pleaded no contest to both charges.[5][6][7][8] Jenna Bush graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in English in 2004.\n\n2004 U.S. presidential election [ edit ]\n\nJenna Bush (second from right) witnesses her father taking the oath on Inauguration Day on January 20, 2005.\n\nShe asked her father not to run for president in 2000: \"Oh, I just wish you wouldn't run. It's going to change our life.\" Her father told her that he and her mother needed to live their lives.[9] In the winter of 2003, however, she decided to become involved in the 2004 campaign.[9] In response to this decision, she made media appearances during the summer of 2004 prior to the election. She and her sister made several joint public appearances, including giving a speech to the Republican Convention on August 31, 2004.[10] She made headlines when she was found sticking her tongue out to media photographers at a campaign stop in St. Louis.[11] Jenna and Barbara took turns traveling to swing states with their father and also gave a seven-page interview and photo shoot in Vogue.[3]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nTeaching [ edit ]\n\nBefore leaving Washington, D.C. in summer 2006, Hager worked at Elsie Whitlow Stokes Community Freedom Public Charter School for a year and a half as a teacher's aide.[12] She took a leave of absence from the charter school position to work at a shelter as part of an internship for UNICEF's Educational Policy Department in Latin America, specifically Panama.[13][14] After her internship for UNICEF, Hager returned to her position at the charter school in Washington, D.C.[15] She currently works as a part-time reading coordinator at the SEED Public Charter School in Baltimore, Maryland, and contributes a monthly news story about education for the Today show.[16]\n\nJenna Hager (left), with her mother, her twin sister, and Elmo , at the Sesame Workshop Fifth Annual Benefit Dinner\n\nWriting [ edit ]\n\nIn 2007, Hager began marketing a book proposal with the assistance of Robert B. Barnett, a Washington attorney.[13] The title of the book is Ana's Story: A Journey of Hope and it chronicles her experiences working with UNICEF sponsored charities in Latin America, including visits to drought-stricken Paraguay in 2006, while working as an intern for United Nations Children's Fund.[13][17][18] HarperCollins announced in March 2007 it would publish the book and it was released September 28, 2007, with an initial printing of 500,000 copies.[19] Her share of the profits will go to UNICEF; the remainder will go to the woman whose life is the basis of the book, assisting in the young woman's continuing education.[20] During the book tour, Hager appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show; during the interview Hager telephoned her parents.[21] Hager wrote a second book, in conjunction with her mother, designed to encourage children to read.[22] The book, entitled Read All About It!, was published on April 22, 2008, also by HarperCollins.[22]\n\nOn November 26, 2012, Hager was named editor-at-large of Southern Living magazine.[23]\n\nNBC News correspondent, Today contributor & 4th hour anchor [ edit ]\n\nIn August 2009, NBC hired Hager as a correspondent and contributor for the Today Show.\n\nAs time has progressed, Hager's profile has increased on Today including filling in as the orange room anchor during the 7AM-9AM hours and substituting for Kathie Lee Gifford or Hoda Kotb during the 4th hour.[24]\n\nIn April 2019, Hager began co-anchoring the fourth hour of Today with Hoda Kotb following Kathie Lee Gifford's departure.[25]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nBush met Henry Chase Hager (born May 9, 1978) during the 2004 presidential campaign. They became engaged in August 2007. Before proposing, Hager asked President Bush for permission to marry his daughter.[26] Their relationship became public when the two appeared together at a White House dinner for The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall in November 2005. Henry Hager attended St. Christopher's School in Richmond, Virginia, and holds an MBA from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Virginia. He worked as a U.S. Department of Commerce aide for Carlos Gutierrez and as a White House aide for Karl Rove.[27] He is the son of former Virginia Republican Party Chairman John H. Hager, who previously served as Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and as the U.S. Department of Education Assistant Secretary under George W. Bush.[28] The wedding took place during a private ceremony on May 10, 2008, at her parents' Prairie Chapel Ranch near Crawford, Texas.\n\nOn December 12, 2012, Henry and Jenna Hager announced on the Today Show that they were expecting their first child.[29] Their daughter was born in April 2013, in New York City.[30] A second daughter was born in August 2015.[31] On April 22, 2019, Hager announced on Today that she is expecting her third child, a boy.[32]\n\nUnlike most of her relatives (but like her twin sister Barbara), Hager is not a member of the Republican Party. While registering to vote in New York, she mistakenly registered with the Independence Party of New York while meaning to declare herself a nonpartisan.[33] In 2010, Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Bush told People that they preferred not to identify with any political party, stating, \"We're both very independent thinkers.\"[34][35][36]\n\nHager serves on the board of the Greenwich International Film Festival.[37][38]\n\nPublications [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Hager_with_Bushes.jpg/220px-Hager_with_Bushes.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/George-W-Bush.jpeg/100px-George-W-Bush.jpeg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Jenna_Bush_Hager_2017_2.jpg/220px-Jenna_Bush_Hager_2017_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Flag_of_Texas.svg/24px-Flag_of_Texas.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Tom_Sawyer_1876_frontispiece.jpg/15px-Tom_Sawyer_1876_frontispiece.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/24px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/NBC_News_2011.svg/80px-NBC_News_2011.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Bush_daughters.png/220px-Bush_daughters.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Flag_of_Maryland.svg/24px-Flag_of_Maryland.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ab/George_W._Bush_inauguration.jpg/220px-George_W._Bush_inauguration.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Jenna_Bush_Hager_2017_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Jenna_Laura_Barbarba.jpg/220px-Jenna_Laura_Barbarba.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/The_Funeral_of_President_George_H.W._Bush_%2831265100837%29.jpg/220px-The_Funeral_of_President_George_H.W._Bush_%2831265100837%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/21px-P_vip.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Jenna_Bush_Hager_2017_2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Bush_Hager", "title": "Jenna Bush Hager", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.34.0-wmf.13", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Jenna_Bush_Hager_2017_2.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
