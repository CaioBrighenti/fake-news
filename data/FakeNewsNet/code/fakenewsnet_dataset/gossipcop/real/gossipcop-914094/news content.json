Ciara gave birth to Sienna last April.\n\nTraceMe\n\nIn a video on the app, Ciara reads a touching open letter to her baby girl.\n\n\"My Princess, it has been the sweetest joy having you in my life,\" Ciara says. \"Since the day you were born, watching you grow up has been the greatest blessing a mom could ask for. You are the little girl I always prayed for and more. I\u2019m so grateful for you.\"\n\n\"When I look in your eyes I see the sweetest angel,\" she added. \"A young Queen. A girl that\u2019s going to be all that she dreams of, a girl that won\u2019t take no mess, and stand up for what she wants and deserves. If I could put out my prayer list and it come true for you ... I pray that you live life to the fullest and truly make the best of it. You explore! That you will be surrounded by the right group of people, have keen discernment, and know when something's not right for you. Guard your heart my dear.\"\n\nCiara is the second celebrity to launch on TraceMe, a platform that enables fans to gain exclusive access to the worlds of their favorite celebrities, athletes and entertainers.\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time 29-year-old Wilson has photographed his wife. Last month, Ciara shared makeup-free bedroom photos taken by the Seattle Seahawks quarterback.\n\nCiara spoke with ET in December, when she gushed over the \"special love\" she shares with Wilson.\n\nWatch below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nCiara and Russell Wilson Go Menswear Chic at Tom Ford Fashion Show: Pics!\n\nCiara Responds to Criticism After Telling Women to 'Level Up' to Find a Husband\n\nCiara Congratulates NFL Star Husband Russell Wilson on Joining New York Yankees\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2011-08/set_split_kris_humphries_kim_kardashian_david_beckham_victoria_beckham_110826_ahwalker_83028268_121310621_pix.jpg?itok=FFZe02eA", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-02/1280_sienna_wilson.jpg?itok=AFo2goZ1", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?itok=86e207qS&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?itok=RPi62mfQ"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?itok=RPi62mfQ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Antoinette Bueno"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/ciara-shares-first-photo-of-daughter-sienna-see-the-gorgeous-snap-96483", "title": "Ciara Shares First Photo of Daughter Sienna: See the Gorgeous Snap!", "meta_data": {"title": "Ciara Shares First Photo of Daughter Sienna: See the Gorgeous Snap! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ciara-shares-first-photo-of-daughter-sienna-see-the-gorgeous-snap-96483", "title": "Ciara Shares First Photo of Daughter Sienna: See the Gorgeous Snap!", "description": "No surprise here -- Ciara and husband Russell Wilson's baby girl, Sienna Princess, is adorable.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?itok=RPi62mfQ", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "No surprise here -- Ciara and husband Russell Wilson's baby girl, Sienna Princess, is adorable.", "title": "Ciara Shares First Photo of Daughter Sienna: See the Gorgeous Snap!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Antoinette Bueno\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ciara-shares-first-photo-of-daughter-sienna-see-the-gorgeous-snap-96483", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?itok=RPi62mfQ"}, "description": "No surprise here -- Ciara and husband Russell Wilson's baby girl, Sienna Princess, is adorable.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Ciara, Russell Wilson", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Ciara, Russell Wilson"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
