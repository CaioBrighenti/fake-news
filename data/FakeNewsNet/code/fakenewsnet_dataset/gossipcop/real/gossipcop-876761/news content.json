On Friday, Ellen DeGeneres premiered her own deleted scenes from the Reputation lead single, claiming that Swift cut DeGeneres out because \u201cshe\u2019s threatened by me sometimes.\u201d Check out the hilarious moment, plus a few other notable spoofs of Swift\u2019s latest clip, below.\n\n1. Ellen DeGeneres\n\nJust look at the comedian sitting at the opposite end of that jewelry-filled bathtub with Taylor Swift. She, of course, puts her own spin on the famous \u201cThe old Taylor can\u2019t come to the phone right now\u201d line and recreates the final scene of the video with her own set of clones. Keep an eye out for \u201cTwerking Ellen,\u201d alongside the rest of her crew.\n\n2. Game of Thrones\n\nA proper Game of Thrones spoof was only fitting considering that the song is rumored to be about Arya Stark. Although the parody only gives us the first verse and chorus, it understandably might have been a bit difficult to find a clip of Jon Snow saying that the old Taylor is dead.\n\n3. Spencer Pratt\n\nThe former The Hills cast member uploaded a full-length parody to YouTube, and it is glorious. The spoof shows Pratt continually sipping from a small teacup, feeding a hummingbird, generously spraying himself with what appears to be sunscreen, and trying out a whole bunch of Snapchat filters. Oh, and a pregnant Heidi Montag makes a wonderful cameo. Can\u2019t-miss stuff right here.\n\n4. The Ohana Adventure\n\nThis parody, coming from YouTube account The Ohana Adventure, reminds us that high school romance hasn\u2019t gotten any easier. The main subject of the spoof realizes as much, singing, \u201cI\u2019m a cringey teen, but I will mature.\u201d The video also features the ninth-grade girl falling up the stairs and struggling to engage in basic conversation with her crush. Maybe he\u2019ll be impressed by the fact that this video has over 11 million views, though?\n\n5. Baby Gizmo\n\nFrom a lyrical standpoint, YouTube account Baby Gizmo\u2019s parody of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d is cute and funny. Starring a young girl and her father, this take on Swift\u2019s clip captures her frustration with a never-ending cycle of chores. Be sure to take note of the incredible purple bow around the 2:16 mark.\n\nHonorable mention: Vanessa Hudgens\n\nThis probably doesn\u2019t qualify as a parody, but it\u2019s great nevertheless. Vanessa Hudgens sports a blonde Swift-esque wig while lip-syncing the chorus and the phone call voiceover. She added the hashtag \u201c#havingwaytoomuchfun\u201d to the Instagram post \u2014 and it shows, as she breaks out laughing in the middle of the video.\n\nLet EW know your favorites in the comments section below.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1155989190.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C6000px%2C3150px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-1146349912.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ed-sheeran.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gordon-ramsey.jpg?crop=267px%2C252px%2C2733px%2C1436px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/r-kelly-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C195px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-1034588192.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/taylor-swift-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/115123-120bc.jpg?crop=0px%2C203px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7351552a9dd44e4036e9afc8adfa2108?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-634837072.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-1140659999.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gaga-spice-girls.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shangri-la_101_0006_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/ellen21.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/taylor-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C91px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kyga.jpg?crop=0px%2C164px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1153173032-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cohen-ihlen-1-2000.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ziggy-stardust.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lil-nas-x-young-thug-mason-ramsey-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1153173024.jpg?crop=0px%2C277px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-679944730.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/ellen21.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Glicksman"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2017/09/22/taylor-swift-lwymmd-video-parodies/", "title": "5 hilarious parodies of Taylor Swift's 'LWYMMD' music video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Taylor Swift, Ellen DeGeneres, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Game of Thrones, Look What You Made Me Do parodies, Look What You Made Me Do video parodies, Taylor Swift spoofs, Ellen DeGeneres parodies", "news_keywords": "Taylor Swift, Ellen DeGeneres, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Game of Thrones, Look What You Made Me Do parodies, Look What You Made Me Do video parodies, Taylor Swift spoofs, Ellen DeGeneres parodies", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres just released her own spoof of Taylor Swift's 'Look What You Made Me Do' music video.
