However, an allegation of rape made against him during his time at Penn State, in 1999, was made public months later. Parker was acquitted in 2001, but another man involved, his roommate Jean Celestin, was initially convicted. (The verdict was later overturned on appeal.) The alleged victim later dropped out of school, before dying by suicide in 2012. Parker apologized and expressed regret for his accuser\u2019s death, but drew criticism for attempts to deflect attention from the topic.\n\nHammer, who costarred in The Birth of a Nation, claimed Parker\u2019s alleged rape making the headlines as Oscar season approached was \u201corchestrated for sure.\u201d He added, \u201cThere was another person in the industry, who had a competing film for the Academy Awards, who decided to release all of the phone records and information.\u201d (Hammer explained several people have told him who the person was, but declined to identify him.)\n\nAffleck, meanwhile, went on to win best actor at the Oscars for his turn in Manchester by the Sea. While he was on the campaign circuit, however, Affleck\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct also resurfaced. He was sued in 2010 by two women who worked on the film I\u2019m Still Here for sexual harassment; both cases were settled out of court. Affleck has denied the allegations. \u201cIt was settled to the satisfaction of all,\u201d Affleck told the Times last year. \u201cI was hurt and upset \u2014 I am sure all were \u2014 but I am over it. It was an unfortunate situation \u2014 mostly for the innocent bystanders of the families of those involved.\u201d\n\nPer Hammer, the difference in treatment between the two men, with Parker\u2019s movie ultimately underperforming at the box office and being completely snubbed by awards bodies, was unfair. \u201cNate had the stuff in his past, which is heinous and tough to get beyond. I get that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that was when he was 18, and now he\u2019s in directors jail. At the same time, the guy who went and won an Academy Award has three cases of sexual assault against him.\u201d (Affleck\u2019s sexual misconduct suits were settled out of court, and no accusations of assault have been publicly made against him.) Hammer continued, \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed to acknowledge the difference in severity between the two sets of allegations \u2014 Parker was accused of rape by a woman who later killed herself; Affleck allegedly used abusive language and, at one point, was claimed to have gotten into bed drunkenly with a woman without consent \u2014 Hammer acquiesced but while maintaining his point. \u201cI\u2019m not saying Nate should not have been in trouble,\u201d he said, dubbing Parker\u2019s alleged behavior \u201cheinous and atrocious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m saying that they got in different levels of trouble. And that\u2019s the disparity. It\u2019s like there are two standards for how to deal with someone who has this kind of issue in their past, you know?\u201d\n\nHammer is currently receiving Oscar buzz for his performance in Call Me by Your Name, which hits theaters on Friday.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/episode-ix.jpg?crop=0px%2C174px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/art-of-self-defense-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/eo_still_044.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/crl13120r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/taylor-schaal.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1047855410.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/mcdskyf_ec030.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mcdfaof_ec021.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/harry-met-sally-4-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C305px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/g3f21.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/varsity-blues.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-874733124.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/paradise-hills.jpg?crop=100px%2C0px%2C2800px%2C1470px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/thecurrentwar_tlr-1_hd1920x1080_prores422hqrec709_st51_20190619.00_00_51_20.still092-copy.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C3429px%2C1800.225px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/scary-stories.jpg?crop=328px%2C0px%2C2343px%2C1230.075px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/betty-gilpin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/michell-rodriguez-fast-and-furious-6.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/shutterstock_editorial_9640569hi_huge.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/58d97e680e1a7dc3015243adebaf1000?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nivola.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/m_07708_c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-874733124.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Canfield"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/20/armie-hammer-casey-affleck-nate-parker-double-standard/", "title": "Armie Hammer calls out double standard between Casey Affleck and Nate Parker", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "armie hammer nate parker,armie hammer casey affleck,armie hammer interview,armie hammer the birth of a nation", "news_keywords": "armie hammer nate parker,armie hammer casey affleck,armie hammer interview,armie hammer the birth of a nation", "description": "Hammer starred in 'The Birth of a Nation,' the film which Nate Parker directed", "og": {"title": "Armie Hammer calls out double standard between Casey Affleck and Nate Parker", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/20/armie-hammer-casey-affleck-nate-parker-double-standard/", "description": "In a new interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Armie Hammer said that Nate Parker\u00a0was\u00a0held to a double standard last year\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-874733124.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/20/armie-hammer-casey-affleck-nate-parker-double-standard/", "description": "Hammer starred in 'The Birth of a Nation,' the film which Nate Parker directed", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-874733124.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/11/20/armie-hammer-casey-affleck-nate-parker-double-standard/", "title": "Armie Hammer calls out double standard between Casey Affleck and Nate Parker", "description": "Hammer starred in 'The Birth of a Nation,' the film which Nate Parker directed", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-874733124.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511154000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
