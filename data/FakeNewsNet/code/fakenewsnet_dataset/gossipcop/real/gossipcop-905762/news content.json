Some background information to know about Rae is that she is a huge Drake fan.\n\nShe\u2019s so much of a fan that she puts the rapper\u2019s lyrics into every episode of Insecure as sort of an easter egg for fans to listen for. She told Hot New Hip Hop doing, \u201cthat was a personal thing for me, but that\u2019s not something that we bang you over the head with.\u201d\n\nSupposedly at the after party, E! News reports that Drake made his entourage stop when he passed by Rae. He then asked if she wanted to go with him to a Netflix party.\n\nSources say she declined the invite because she was with her friends and the walked away. Another source says that it didn\u2019t happen that way. Instead, they say the two were very cordial with each other and, \u201cexchanged pleasantries\u201d and that she \u201cnever denied\u201d Drake.\n\n*Obsessed Fan Who Dedicated Entire Season to Artist Continues to Shamelessly Fangirl When She Sees Him at Party Later https://t.co/RggtVnc55f \u2014 Issa Rae (@IssaRae) January 12, 2018\n\nThat source also said that the two didn\u2019t know each other very well anyway. E! News tweeted that Rae turned down Drake which caused her to speak up about the exchange. She doesn\u2019t come out saying that she turned Drake down, however she tweets a headline with the E! News article attached saying, \u201cObsessed Fan Who Dedicated Entire Season To Artist Continues to Shamelessly Fangirl When She Sees Him at Party Later.\u201d\n\nInstead of turning him down, she fangirled about the whole meeting. The same night, Drake DJ\u2019ed at another party to which Rae loved. In a video, she could be heard calling Drake \u201czaddy\u201d and complimenting Drake saying the playlist he used was, \u201csimply correct\u201d and that he\u2019s a, \u201cphenomenal DJ.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE STORIES ON BLACKAMERICAWEB.COM:\n\nGET THE HOTTEST STORIES STRAIGHT TO YOUR INBOX:\n\nClose Thank you for subscribing!
