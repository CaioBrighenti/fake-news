media\n\n(CNN) When the Beatles' \"Abbey Road\" album was released 1969 -- featuring the Fab Four striding through the crosswalk near their London studio -- the imagery added to the persistent rumors that Paul McCartney had actually died a few years earlier and had been replaced by a lookalike.\n\nMany noted that Paul was the only one of the four to be barefoot, and John Lennon and Ringo Starr were in all white and all black, respectively, the colors of mourning in many cultures.\n\nBut McCartney says it was just hot.\n\n\"It was a very hot day and I happened to be wearing sandals like I am today so I just kicked them off because it was so hot we went across barefoot,\" he explained. \"There was no special meaning.\"\n\n\ud83c\udfa5@maryamccartney #PaulMcCartney #EgyptStation #AbbeyRoad
