Lucky for us, the couple shared quite a few photos of the intimate, outdoor nuptials!\n\nThe actress, who seemingly wed over the weekend, shared a photo on her Instagram after the procession. Bissett stunned in a a strapless gown ; she went the flower crown route, with white blooms surrounding her low bun and a sweeping veil. The 46-year-old accessorized the look with chandelier earrings, and a dainty silver bracelet.\n\nThe bride and groom's children (Bissett's from her previous marriage to fellow Melrose actor Rob Estes) served as members of the bridal party. Two adorable flower girls donned blush dresses with white floral headbands. Groomsmen opted for a classic black tuxedo. White blooms were also spread in front of the altar. Additional photos were shared on Bissett's Facebook page, where we get an even closer look at her gorgeous gown.\n\nSee More: First Same-Sex Muslim Wedding Takes Place In The UK\n\n\"Happily Ever After \u2764\ufe0f #love #family #wedding #blessed,\" she captioned.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nIf you don't know what the actress has been up to lately, she recently reunited with former Melrose Place co-star Jack Wagner to reprise their roles in the Hallmark Channel romantic comedy Wedding March 2: Resorting to Love .

It put me in the mood for planning a wedding!\u201d she revealed to TV Insider . \"I\u2019ve been learning a lot about weddings even though it\u2019s my second one. My favorite moment, hands down, is when the bride comes out and it\u2019s the first time people see her and she walks down the aisle.
