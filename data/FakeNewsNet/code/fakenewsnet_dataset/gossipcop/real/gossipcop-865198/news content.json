He also talked about his upcoming movie Bushwick, a dystopian movie thriller starring Dave Bautista that opens this Friday.\n\n13 Reasons Why has become a major cultural touchstone. It\u2019s very popular, but also had its detractors. What was your take on the controversy over its depiction of suicide?\n\nControversy ultimately helps the show and helps our platform. What we set out to do when we were making the show was to try to help one person. If there\u2019s one person out there, if there\u2019s one teenager who watches the show and realizes that they aren\u2019t alone in this \u2014 then we would\u2019ve been successful.\n\nSo by that barometer, we\u2019ve been pretty successful, because millions of teenagers are now having a dialogue, with their parents and their teachers and with each other, about what it means to be kind to each other. I understand and respect everyone\u2019s opinion, particularly parents who want to protect their children. I just want to offer up that maybe it\u2019s more beneficial to talk about it.\n\nWhat kind of response have you gotten from people on the street and on social media?\n\nWe have the best fans in the world. I see them all the time on the street; I interact with them on social media. They are very moved and affected by the show, and it\u2019s made their lives better. There\u2019s nothing more humbling or gratifying to me than to be part of a project that makes people feel like they can be who they want to be and not have to conform to anyone else\u2019s ideals, especially in this day and age in light of everything that\u2019s going on in our country.\n\nWere you surprised that the show got a second season?\n\nNo, we\u2019re looking at the most talked-about show this year \u2014 still! I was humbled by it; I didn\u2019t know when we would hear that announcement. I definitely had a feeling we would come back for Season 2. It seemed inevitable.\n\nView photos Dylan Minnette as Clay and Christian Navarro as Tony in Netflix\u2019s \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 (Photo: Netflix) More\n\nWhat will Season 2 be like?\n\nIt\u2019s going to continue the story for all of those characters. Other than that, I have to keep my cards close to the chest. But you can expect a lot more of Tony Padilla and Clay Jensen and Hannah Baker. We\u2019re building upon a solid foundation. I\u2019m in the midst of it right now, so I\u2019m excited every week when I get scripts.\n\nAre we going to get more insight into Tony this year?\n\nI certainly hope I do a good job in allowing you to. I\u2019ve been working hard this season and going into it. One of the things I wanted to make sure with Brian Yorkey, the showrunner, is that we explore Tony, independent of Clay Jensen and Hannah Baker. We\u2019ve got a couple more months, and I\u2019m excited to see another side of this guy.\n\nTony wasn\u2019t named on the tapes, but do you feel like he\u2019s complicit in Hannah\u2019s death in a way?\n\nAbsolutely. One of the messages of the show is that we\u2019re all complicit. If you stand by and do nothing, you are as guilty if not more guilty than those who are persecuting. What we discover in this season is how exactly complicit and how that chips at his soul.\n\nView photos Christian Navarro as Tony and Katherine Langford as Hannah in Netflix\u2019s \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 (Photo: Netflix) More", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cJZ0wO4cjUH9gu8v7_Cu.g--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/15f0a27d56c1c9ea79a3a4de03efa606", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6.xXl3ZL01wKP3pCCQ8HoA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/15f0a27d56c1c9ea79a3a4de03efa606", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/R4y85yyLp2VkGSP4t9bLxQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/352df8c28c9d5bd65537dbf8d3b23945", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aPyffYVj0EqHClZiEidncA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/e62559b3fc30504daff919433f7fac2e", "https://s.yimg.com/nn/lib/metro/DailyFantasy_BN_Baseball_300x250-min.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SJs6ythdwMaTxjzj1SfK_g--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO2ZpPWZpbGw7dz04NDtoPTg0O2lsPXBsYW5l/http://l.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-10-19/a6494b00-b503-11e7-ae84-3364a56b6e6b_kellywoo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cJZ0wO4cjUH9gu8v7_Cu.g--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/15f0a27d56c1c9ea79a3a4de03efa606", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelly Woo", "Writer", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/13-reasons-star-christian-navarro-tony-theme-song-new-movie-bushwick-150029676.html", "title": "'13 Reasons Why' star Christian Navarro on his Tony theme song and new movie 'Bushwick'", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooEnt", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Christian Navarro talks Season 2 of '13 Reasons Why,' the controversy over the show, and of course, that hair.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cJZ0wO4cjUH9gu8v7_Cu.g--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/15f0a27d56c1c9ea79a3a4de03efa606", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cJZ0wO4cjUH9gu8v7_Cu.g--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/15f0a27d56c1c9ea79a3a4de03efa606"}, "title": "'13 Reasons Why' star Christian Navarro on his Tony theme song and new movie 'Bushwick'"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "news_keywords": "Christian Navarro, Netflix, Brian Yorkey, Hannah Baker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=9a486529-2765-33d0-8a14-3a3e9307126a&src=web", "description": "Christian Navarro talks Season 2 of '13 Reasons Why,' the controversy over the show, and of course, that hair.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cJZ0wO4cjUH9gu8v7_Cu.g--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/15f0a27d56c1c9ea79a3a4de03efa606", "description": "Christian Navarro talks Season 2 of '13 Reasons Why,' the controversy over the show, and of course, that hair.", "title": "'13 Reasons Why' star Christian Navarro on his Tony theme song and new movie 'Bushwick'", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/13-reasons-star-christian-navarro-tony-theme-song-new-movie-bushwick-150029676.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 73756409831, "app_id": 90376669494}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=9a486529-2765-33d0-8a14-3a3e9307126a&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=9a486529-2765-33d0-8a14-3a3e9307126a&src=web"}}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKvNp0PEkHY"], "publish_date": 1503673229.0, "source": "https://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
