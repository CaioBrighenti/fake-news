Well, she may be now after Swifties freaked after she possibly dissed her former BFF Taylor in a new Insta post!\n\nWell, Karlie Kloss definitely wasn\u2019t cleaning up bottles with Taylor Swift on New Years Day\u2026 instead, the model was posting a video from her LOVE Advent Calendar shoot, which featured a black and white film of Karlie showing off her basketball skills. Karlie, 24, titled the sexy snap \u201cSwish swish Love Advent \u201917 thank you,\u201d which spurred a dramatic response from Taylor Swift fans, because of the reference to Katy Perry\u2018s recent diss track \u201cSwish, Swish.\u201d Now, it\u2019s unclear if Karlie purposefully used the lyrics to Katy\u2019s collab with Nicki Minaj, that was specifically aimed at Taylor, but Tay\u2019s loyal army is not having it. \u201cThis is just sad why couldn\u2019t she have used a different caption?\u201d One user commented on the video with several sad emojis, while another wrote, \u201cThis is the worst thing you could do to a friend.\u201d\n\nIt is important to point out, as many of Karlie\u2019s defenders did, that \u201cswish swish\u201d is a clever reference to basketball and makes for a cute caption, and is not necessarily referencing Katy Perry\u2019s song. However, this isn\u2019t the first time recently that Karlie and Taylor\u2019s friendship has been questioned. Over July 4th weekend, when Taylor typically has her squad over to her Newport, RI home, Karlie was with Kendall Jenner, the sister of Taylor\u2019s arch-nemesis Kim Kardashian, and fans were furious, feeling like this was a direct hit at Tay. Another clue into their crumbling relationship was that Karlie\u2019s name was clearly absent from Taylor\u2019s Junior Jewels T-shirt, which included Gigi [Hadid], Ed [Sheeran], Blake [Lively] & other close friends, in her \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video. Still, Karlie did make an effort to wish Taylor a happy birthday on Dec. 13, 2017, by posting a photo to Instagram and Twitter, but this caption could definitely be intentional shade at her former bestie. So sad!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Karlie was purposefully shading Taylor with her caption?
