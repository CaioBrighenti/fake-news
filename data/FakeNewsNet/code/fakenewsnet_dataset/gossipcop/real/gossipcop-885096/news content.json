A woman who has really nice, looked-after skin is such a turn-on for me. It\u2019s always sexy.\u201d\n\nSex-appeal aside, Elba is typically known as a tough guy in his TV roles. But there\u2019s one person with a real knack for turning him to mush: His daughter, Isan. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s with me now for three weeks and I love it; I absolutely love it,\u201d Elba tells the magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019d manage to be on seven flights a month and still get her to school.\u201d\n\nIsan, born in 2002, is Elba\u2019s daughter with ex-wife Dormowa Sherma. Both parents live in Atlanta, so Elba splits his time between that city and his native Britain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful to my ex-wife, [Isan\u2019s] mother, and I\u2019m grateful I get to live my dream. At the same time, I miss things, which I regret,\u201d he adds.\n\nElba can next be seen in the upcoming Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance and Prometheus.", "images":
