preferences\n\nWith the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show just moments away, models walking this year's extravaganza had an early start this morning as they made their way backstage for preening.\n\nTaking place in Shanghai for the first time in the runway's history, the showcase kicks off at 8pm local time - 12pm GMT.\n\nJoining the models this year for her second VS fashion show is Bella Hadid.\n\nHaving made her debut walking for the lingerie giant in Paris last year alongside older sister Gigi, Bella this year is the only Hadid walking after Gigi pulled out just last week.\n\nAlso absent this year is the Hadid sisters' good friend Kendall Jenner, who is skipping this year due to a contractual agreement with rival lingerie brand La Perla of which she is the face.\n\nBut while Gigi and Kendall are notable absences from this year's line up, there is a smorgasbord of well-known and legendary Victoria's Secret models returning to the runway today.\n\nAdriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Jasmine Tookes, and Stella Maxwell are all in Shanghai for the show, while Candice Swanepoel regains her place having stepped away from the catwalk for 2016 to have her baby.\n\nKarlie Kloss also returns to the line up having left the brand two years ago.\n\nVictoria's Secret Fashion Show 2017: Confirmed Model Line-up 54 show all Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2017:
