(What more could you ask for, really?)\n\nDespite the fact that his beloved Seattle Seahawks aren\u2019t competing in this year\u2019s big game, the Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom actor still has reason to celebrate: In the quick spot from the beer brand, Pratt learns that, well, he\u2019s landed a role in a quick spot for the beer brand. (It\u2019s very meta.)\n\nUpon getting the good news, he immediately starts a training regime to prime himself for the new gig. He works out, practices saying \u201cMichelob Ultra\u201d in his lowest voice, and even tries \u201cmethod\u201d acting \u2014 all while trying to impress others with his exciting upcoming role, natch.\n\nOur favorite part, though, is the scene where he stands in front of a mirror (shirtless, of course), contemplating his character\u2019s name and backstory. \u201cWho\u2019s the character?\u201d he asks himself, as he flexes his muscles. \u201cMichelob Pickelstein. Michelob. My name is Tommy Ultra. Tommy Ultra?\u201d\n\nIt looks like the 38-year-old hasn\u2019t let his Guardians of the Galaxy workouts go to waste. \u201cYou gotta be fit. You gotta love Michelob Ultra,\u201d he says in the ad, right before getting a harsh reality check.\n\nPratt hopped onto Instagram to promote the commercial, sharing a pic of himself with the caption: \u201cThese days, I\u2019m trying to stay in top shape for work. So when I see a beer, I can\u2019t help but squint my eyes and imagine a treadmill \u2014 specifically how long I\u2019ll have to be on that treadmill to burn off the beer.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cMichelob ULTRA has only 95 calories and 2.6 grams of carbs SO\u2026 I can run that off very easily. Probably in like 10 seconds? (I run 85 mph) Which really makes you wonder why I\u2019m not playing in the Super Bowl instead of just doing a commercial that will air during the Super Bowl. So anyways, Michelob ULTRA doesn\u2019t throw off my workout routine. And it tastes great. So\u2026 That\u2019s what I call a win win.\u201d (Add in this commercial and we call it a win-win-win!)\n\nFans are definitely feeling it.\n\nHow to sell Michelob Ultra pic.twitter.com/gn7vZovXiX \u2014 Dianna McDougall (@DiannaMcD) January 29, 2018\n\nCharacter development!

But prepare yourself, because things don\u2019t exactly work out for him in the way that you\u2019d expect. Sorry, Star Lord!\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite 2018 Super Bowl commercial so far?
