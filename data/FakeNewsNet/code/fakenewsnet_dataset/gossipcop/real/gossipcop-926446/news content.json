These are vagina pants. To rule out the possibility that prudish viewers might mistake them for something less primal \u2014 blossoming flowers, perhaps, or an avant-garde tutu \u2014 Monae includes a shot of her pal, Thor: Ragnorok actress Tessa Thompson, poking her head out between their lips, like a beautiful adult baby popping through the birth canal (though some have speculated she\u2019s the clitoris). In addition to the pants\u2019 unapologetically loud-and-proud celebration of the female form, what makes them such a refreshing statement is the fact that they\u2019re actually quite anatomically accurate. Despite what the porn industry might suggest, vaginas are complicated and multi-layered \u2014 just like these pants.\n\nIn case it wasn't clear, these are vagina pants.\n\nTechnically, these should be called \u201cvulva pants.\u201d The word vagina is often used to refer to what is actually called the vulva, which consists of the whole external shebang: the labia, clitoris, vagina (the actual orifice), and urethra. In turn, the labia \u2014 that\u2019s Latin for \u201clips\u201d \u2014 are considered as two separate parts, the labia majora and the labia minora. The former are the outer lips, and the latter are the inner lips closer to the vaginal opening itself.\n\nIf you watch a lot of porn, you might get the idea that the labia \u2014 especially the labia minora \u2014 are tight, neat bits of skin that are not at all like what Monae\u2019s layered pants suggest. The fact is that all vulvas are different, as experts concerned about unrealistic body image have pointed out. Porn favors vaginas where the labia minora don\u2019t peek out of the labia majora, but in reality, \u201clabial protuberance,\u201d as researchers refer to it, is quite common. And, as Monae\u2019s complicated, beautiful, multi-layered pants suggest, it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of, either.\n\nA wider shot of Monae and her dancers, some also wearing vulva pants, shows a wide array of labial shapes \u2014 some narrow, some more ruffled, some deeper pink than others. The only way she could have improved upon this representation is by showing a wider range of colors: Depending on a person\u2019s coloring, labia can be pink, brown, reddish, or purplish, just like the lips on your face. On Twitter, Monae and Thompson have strongly implied that the dancers who are not wearing vulva pants represent women who do not have vaginas.\n\nIn both the video and lyrics for \u201cPYNK,\u201d Monae shuns the societal reflex to resort to euphemisms. Sure, she winkingly features shots of peeled citrus and oysters, but Monae remains as frank about the female form and sexuality as ever, challenging the rest of us to do the same.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dsZ5hTqk9YtgS.gif", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=19987187&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://alb.reddit.com/snoo.gif?q=CAAHAAABAAoACQAAAAACWQ1QAA==&s=XEpByt_R434fqqGl0DfctKqGILDzrA7eDqfNEeDOv7E=", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/assets/placeholder.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/e0/1b/69/08/1fab/40f2/abe4/b87314d3fd13/janelle-monaes-new-video-for-pynk-shows-her-wearing-vagina-pants-which-accurately-capture-the.png?rect=0%2C29%2C1038%2C519&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1038", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1455869871397255&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/da/ce/4a/6f/d511/461f/acd5/1b60b043b1d7/janelle-monaes-new-video-for-pynk-shows-her-wearing-vagina-pants-which-accurately-capture-the.gif?rect=0%2C29%2C1038%2C519&auto=compress&dpr=2&w=650&fm=jpg", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=275370&fmt=gif", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/assets/logo_desktop.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&w=246"], "top_img": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/e0/1b/69/08/1fab/40f2/abe4/b87314d3fd13/janelle-monaes-new-video-for-pynk-shows-her-wearing-vagina-pants-which-accurately-capture-the.png?rect=0%2C29%2C1038%2C519&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1038", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inverse.com/article/43557-janelle-monae-pynk-vagina-pants-vulva-anatomy", "title": "Janelle Monae's \"PYNK\" Video Teaches an Accurate Lesson on Vagina Anatomy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "description": "In Janelle Monae's new video for \"PYNK,\" released Tuesday, she wears a pair of pink frilled pants that have been widely dubbed on the internet as \"vagina pants.\" Featuring layers of multicolored ruffles, her pants represent the labia majora and labia minora of the human vagina.", "keywords": "Sexuality,Biology,Health,Music,Pop Culture Science,Pop Music,Pornography,Video,Short,Focused Short,Science,Science & Chill", "twitter": {"image": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/e0/1b/69/08/1fab/40f2/abe4/b87314d3fd13/janelle-monaes-new-video-for-pynk-shows-her-wearing-vagina-pants-which-accurately-capture-the.png?rect=0%2C29%2C1038%2C519&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1038", "title": "Janelle Monae's \"PYNK\" Video Teaches an Accurate Lesson on Vagina Anatomy", "description": "It's quite different from what you'll find in porn.", "site": "@inversedotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.inverse.com/article/43557-janelle-monae-pynk-vagina-pants-vulva-anatomy", "image": {"identifier": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/e0/1b/69/08/1fab/40f2/abe4/b87314d3fd13/janelle-monaes-new-video-for-pynk-shows-her-wearing-vagina-pants-which-accurately-capture-the.png?rect=0%2C29%2C1038%2C519&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1038", "type": "image/png"}, "title": "Janelle Monae's \"PYNK\" Video Teaches an Accurate Lesson on Vagina Anatomy", "description": "It's quite different from what you'll find in porn.", "site_name": "Inverse", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_at": "2018-04-11T19:42:00.000000Z", "modified_at": "2019-06-03T21:06:39.749157Z", "category": "Science & Chill", "tag": "Science & Chill", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inverse"}, "author": "Yasmin Tayag", "fb": {"pages": 820406651341117, "app_id": 1452605975051281}, "parsely-post-id": "01ad6ecd-03a5-4295-b932-dc01fdf0c0db", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "theme-color": "#231f20"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inverse.com", "summary": ""}
