But it\u2019s 2017, folks, and we all know that baking our skin for real is out and a fake tan is in\u2014and we\u2019ve go plenty of spray tan tips.\n\nThere are a few other means of getting some color\u2014easy at-home self-tanner, for one\u2014which can be effective but runs the risk of turning your skin (and sheets) orange. Spray tanning is definitely where it is at.\n\nHere, ten spray tan tips you must know before you hop in that spray tan booth. (Number 11 goes unsaid, but for the love of god, don\u2019t forget to put on the goggles.)\n\nSpray tans last about a week, give or take\n\n\n\nThis can vary from person to person, but they typically last about 5-7 days from one application.\n\nShower and exfoliate before you tan\n\n\n\nUse a body scrub head to toe to slough away any dry, flaky skin before you get a spray tan so that the pigment will adhere smoothly for the most even results (as in, least streaky).\n\nThe color won\u2019t just wash off\n\n\n\nThe pigment that spray tans leave behind is meant to slowly fade as your top layer of skin regenerates, so it\u2019s not the kind of thing you can just scrub off. That\u2019s why it\u2019s able to last up to a week\u2014and why you should approach with caution to make sure you won\u2019t be stuck looking unnaturally tan for a full seven days.\n\nApply lotion every day\n\n\n\nKeeping your newly tanned skin hydrated is the best way to make the color last longer, because it won\u2019t dry out and need to be exfoliated prematurely.\n\nIt\u2019ll get darker after application\n\n\n\nSimilarly to standard self-tanner, spray tans will get darker from the time they\u2019re applied and as the day progresses. The color takes a little while to fully develop, so don\u2019t be alarmed if you leave feeling like it\u2019s too light\u2014it won\u2019t be for long.\n\nPat, don\u2019t rub, your skin dry\n\n\n\nTo preserve your tan, pat yourself dry rather than scour with a towel after getting out of the shower. The idea is to not exfoliate for as long as possible so that you don\u2019t slough off the tan. Avoid using loofahs or coarse washcloths for the same reason.\n\nWear nail polish\n\n\n\nEven if it\u2019s nothing more than a clear coat, wearing polish into the booth will help to protect your nails from the spray tan. If you do have a full manicure, don\u2019t worry about it getting ruined\u2014your nails will be wiped off afterwards.\n\nThink about your bathing suit\n\n\n\nWhile many people decide to get a spray tan while wearing nothing (no tan lines!), if you do wear a bathing suit, wear an old one you don\u2019t mind ruining, since the tan can stain the fabric.\n\nApply barrier cream\n\n\n\nNaturally drier areas of the skin, like the elbows, ankles, and knees, will absorb more pigment, so always apply a protective barrier cream before the tan so that they don\u2019t go too dark. Most spray tan salons will provide the cream for use, so make sure you don\u2019t skip it.\n\nLook for a discount deal\n\n\n\nSpray tanning can be expensive, but plenty of salons will offer deals on sites like Groupon and LivingSocial\u2014if you\u2019re apprehensive about the process but still want to give it a shot, at least make sure you\u2019re not paying out the nose for your first time.\n\nOriginally published July 2016.
