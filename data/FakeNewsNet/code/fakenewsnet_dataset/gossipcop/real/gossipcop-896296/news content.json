A series of Boomerangs captured the children jumping off rocks into the water and floating along with the stream. Out of the water, they had a blast burying themselves in the sand and riding ATVs.\n\nStefani, donning a green tank top and reflective aviator-style shades, also made sure to share a selfie. She even appears to have captured Shelton in the wilderness despite his camo attire.\n\nAlong for the fun was Stefani\u2019s goddaughter Stella, who proved to be a model in the making while posing for a shot on the singer\u2019s Instagram page wearing camo overalls.\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani's kids Gwen Stefani Instagram\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani's kids Gwen Stefani Instagram\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani's kids Gwen Stefani Instagram\n\nImage zoom Gwen Stefani's spring break Gwen Stefani Instagram\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

The family has spent holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas out in the country.\n\nRELATED: 29 Pics That Prove Gwen & Blake\u2019s Romance Is the Real Thing\n\nImage zoom Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani Instagram\n\nIn her cover story for Marie Claire\u2019s Holiday 2017 issue, the pop star said that things can get pretty dirty when she spends time at Shelton\u2019s Oklahoma ranch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tribal,\u201d she said. \u201cBlake has a sister, she comes with her kids.
