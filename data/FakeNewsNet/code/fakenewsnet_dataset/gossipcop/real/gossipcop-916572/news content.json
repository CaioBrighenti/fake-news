In fact, today, during an interview with reporters from E! News, Charlize opened up about her formative years which consisted of a lot of pot-smoking.\n\nDuring the chat, the 42-year-old actress, and her co-star, David Oyelowo, went into depth on their histories with smoking marijuana. The question of marijuana use comes at a particularly relevant time, considering most states in the USA are on their way to legalizing it recreationally.\n\nTheron admitted she was a \u201cwake-and-baker\u201d for most of her life and Sibley Coles asked her if she remembered her first time. Unlike most, Charlize\u2019s time with marijuana-smoking came during her later years.\n\nShe said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mess around with anything until I was much older.\u201d However, she ended up appreciating the green plant more than alcohol or any other drug for its therapeutic effects.\n\nThe actress claimed when she was younger her \u201cchemistry\u201d with the plant was much better, but it changed one day. The Academy-Award winner stated one day it just became boring.\n\nAs a result of the change in effect, Theron realized it was time to give it up and move on to the next stage of her life. And while she may have forgotten about it, for the most part, she\u2019s not averse to using it for sleep.\n\nThe actress claimed that nowadays, there are many different kinds of strains so the effects can be more specifically suited to an individual\u2019s needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheron admitted she has \u201cterrible insomnia\u201d so wouldn\u2019t mind smoking it again. Furthermore, the actress even claimed she might use it to help her mother as well who suffers the same condition.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Ewan-McGregor-And-Mary-Elizabeth-Winstead-Hollywood.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toni-Braxton-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Charlize-Theron-Denies-Ever-Dating-Brad-Pitt-As-She-Is-Caught-Getting-Cozy-With-Seal-700x466.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bilie-lee-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-RHOA-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Charlize-Theron-Celebarena.BlogSpot.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pauley-Perrette-Mark-Harmon-NCIS-300x195.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Kandi-Burruss-300x233.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charlize-Theron--e1519697221555.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Seal-and-Charlize-Theron--700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-Donald-Trump-Nancy-Pelosi-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Charlize-Theron--e1519697221555.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/charlize-theron-admits-to-being-a-wake-and-baker-during-her-younger-years-119935/", "title": "Charlize Theron Admits To Being A \u201cWake-And-Baker\u201d During Her Younger Years", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "charlize theron,", "keywords": "celebrity news, charlize theron,", "description": "Charlize Theron doesn't care what you think of her childhood.
