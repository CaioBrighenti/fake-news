After he pulled Dylan from the water, Jacob used CPR to save the child\u2019s life, something he learned from the 2015 blockbuster during a scene where Johnson\u2019s character performs CPR on his daughter. \u201cThe movie just popped up in my head and I started thinking about that scene,\u201d Jacob, who lives in Michigan, told the Washington Post. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I started doing the compressions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so amazed and impressed by this little [10-year-old] boy\u2019s heroic actions and calm instincts in the middle of that kind of emergency distress,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cI now need to shake young Jacob\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\nThe star, who\u2019s currently filming Skyscraper in Vancouver, later invited Jacob and his family to the set.
