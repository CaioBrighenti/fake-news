News reports.\n\nBookout\u2019s husband, Taylor McKinney, and their two children, Jayde, nearly 3, and Maverick, nearly 2, were also granted two-year restraining orders against Edwards. The troubled reality star, 30, will still be able to see his 9-year-old son, Bentley, whom he shares with Bookout, under the restraining order.\n\n\u201cWe did agree to a restraining order where Ryan will not go within 100 feet of Maci and her current husband and their two children. Ryan has no exclusions with Bentley and is still able to see his son under the new restraining order,\u201d Edwards\u2019 attorney Jonathan Turner told E! News on Tuesday, May 22. \u201cThis gives Ryan a lot more protection against any false allegations, allows him to avoid getting arrested without a hearing first, and allows him to be around his son most importantly.\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan agreed to this outcome to make it easier on everyone and not go through a formal process of a trial,\u201d Turner added to the outlet. \u201cMoving forward Ryan hopes everyone can get through this without any issues and that he can see his son.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly confirmed on March 29 that Bookout, 26, had filed an order of protection against Edwards on behalf of herself and all three of her children after he allegedly threatened them. McKinney, 29, also filed a separate order. They were granted temporary orders on April 2.\n\nAccording to the court documents previously obtained by Radar Online, the Bulletproof author accused Edwards of threatening to \u201churt\u201d her if she didn\u2019t answer her cellphone and claimed he \u201cshowed up [to Bentley\u2019s baseball game] \u201cunder the influence of heroin and got in my face, yelling and threatening to hurt me.\u201d\n\nMcKinney, meanwhile, alleged that Edwards threatened to \u201cput a bullet\u201d in his head.\n\nEdwards, who has a history of substance abuse, was also arrested in March for violating his probation after he was caught by police with a large amount of heroin and \u201capproximately 14 hypodermic needles\u201d in his car in 2017. The Teen Mom dad is expecting his second child with his wife, Mackenzie Standifer.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is facing substance abuse issues, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for free and confidential information 24/7.\n\nFor the latest TV news and interviews subscribe to our new podcast \u2018Watch With Us\u2019 below!\n\n\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
