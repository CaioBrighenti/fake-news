Take the time Kim Kardashian West deleted all of her family holiday photos from her Instagram because they didn't fit her aesthetic. Or the family's dedication to body art. And let's not forget that Kylie Jenner once got a haircut with kitchen scissors.\n\nBut on this Sunday's episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian take things to a new level. In a bid to see who is healthier, Kim, Kourtney, and their best bud Jonathan Cheban take part in a health exam known as a \"sweat test.\" The name is exactly what it implies: The threesome must somehow collect vials of their own sweat to then send off to a lab, which will test for any deficiencies or heavy metals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a sweat test, and it just sounds gross, but we do some pretty crazy things to get the information we need, especially when it comes to beauty and health,\" Kourtney said to the camera about her sister's health challenge. \"I am definitely willing to do Kim\u2019s test to prove that I\u2019m healthier.\u201d\n\nTo complete this mission, the three put on fluffy white robes and step inside Kim's home sauna (because of course Kim has a home sauna). There, they immediately begin to pour out sweat, and Jonathan announces, \"I feel like a pig.\" He collects his share of sweat in record time. \u201cI think this is good enough,\" he said. \"It looks like cloudy sweat.\u201d Gross.\n\nOnce the trio exit the sauna they lounge about, while Kim exclaims that she's \"exhausted\" from the practice. Kourtney kindly points out to the group that the test and its results are likely total and utter nonsense. Why? Because they are covered in makeup that would alter any findings. \u201cI\u201dll ask my doctor, but I don\u2019t want to take false results from sweat mixed with makeup and spray tan,\" she explained.\n\nBut hey, at least Kourtney said she learned one thing from the entire ordeal. As she noted, \"I think I definitely need to start drinking more water.\" Watch the entire preview clip, below.\n\nRelated Content:\n\nHere's Exactly What All the Kardashian and Jenner Sisters Are Eating for Lunch\n\nWhat's That Salad the Kardashians Are Always Eating on Their Show?\n\n7 Celebrities Who Believe in the Health Trend Kim Kardashian Is Trying", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d06a2c4cd0aea7f46eed0c1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-967454690%2520(1).jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4ea7ae64466970fceb83d5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202018-01-04%2520at%25205.15.43%2520PM.png", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d06a1d083e26e2e67bd04bf/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kristian%2520cardenas%2520fb.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d0395d3b1802a9f99653ead/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-kkw-newspaper.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d0e7b89415015592472155a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kim-khloe-karashian.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c6c7d7efe05cf2db64d5038/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/khloe-tristan.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4ea7ae64466970fceb83d5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202018-01-04%2520at%25205.15.43%2520PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Natasha Reda", "Christopher Rosa", "Ana Col\u00f3n", "Stacey Leasc", "Anna Moeslein", "Marci Robin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kourtney-and-kim-kardashian-compete-in-a-sweat-test-video", "title": "Kourtney and Kim Kardashian Compete in a 'Sweat Test' Just to See Who's Healthier", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian hit the sauna to compete in a 'sweat test' on 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians.'", "keywords": "Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Gross.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4ea7ae64466970fceb83d5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202018-01-04%2520at%25205.15.43%2520PM.png", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Kim and Kourtney Kardashian Compete in a 'Sweat Test' Just to See Who's Healthier", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kourtney-and-kim-kardashian-compete-in-a-sweat-test-video"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Gross.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4ea7ae64466970fceb83d5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202018-01-04%2520at%25205.15.43%2520PM.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Kim and Kourtney Kardashian Compete in a 'Sweat Test' Just to See Who's Healthier"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrogkybGtcs"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
