We\u2019d come in, and [Donald Trump] had done something the night before or that, you know, it was a whole new ballgame. But I\u2019m so thankful that I was there for that year.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 presidential election \u2014 what led to it, what came after it \u2014 contributed to why the sketch series felt like \u201canother show.\u201d The season\u2019s highlights included Alec Baldwin taking on Trump, Kate McKinnon playing Hillary Clinton, and Melissa McCarthy impersonating Sean Spicer, all factors that contributed to a noteworthy ratings bump.\n\nAlong with Moynihan, cast members Sasheer Zamata and Vanessa Bayer also left the show in May. \u201cThe day you get SNL, you start worrying about your exit from SNL,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cYou\u2019re auditioning for the show every week for nine years. You think, \u2018Oh no, I have to keep going. This is my life\u2019s dream. What do I do after this?'\u201d\n\nThe answer? His own show: Moynihan is gearing up to launch Me, Myself & I on CBS. See a trailer for the series below, and check out Moynihan\u2019s best SNL sketches here.\n\nMe, Myself & I premieres this fall.\n\nReporting by Natalie Abrams", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/1568-angel_1200x6282.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/netflix-tvs.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/angel2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/hulu.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-696092882.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/snl.jpg?crop=1743px%2C91px%2C914px%2C914px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-696092882.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Bacle"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/08/01/bobby-moynihan-snl-final-season/", "title": "Bobby Moynihan says last year on SNL felt like 'another show'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "bobby moynihan, bobby moynihan snl, bobby moynihan saturday night live", "news_keywords": "bobby moynihan, bobby moynihan snl, bobby moynihan saturday night live", "description": "The 'SNL' actor has a new show premiering on CBS this fall", "og": {"title": "Bobby Moynihan Says Last Year on 'SNL' Felt Like 'Another Show'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/08/01/bobby-moynihan-snl-final-season/", "description": "After nine seasons, Bobby Moynihan left\u00a0Saturday Night Live\u00a0this past May at the conclusion of the NBC show's 42nd season \u2014\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-696092882.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/08/01/bobby-moynihan-snl-final-season/", "description": "The 'SNL' actor has a new show premiering on CBS this fall", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-696092882.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/08/01/bobby-moynihan-snl-final-season/", "title": "Bobby Moynihan Says Last Year on 'SNL' Felt Like 'Another Show'", "description": "The 'SNL' actor has a new show premiering on CBS this fall", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-696092882.jpg?crop=0px%2C40px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/lU0TkGSkemM"], "publish_date": 1501560000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
