Still, we\u2019re happy that Jennifer Love Hewitt finally joined Instagram and is seeing what all the hype is about. Hewitt\u2019s brand new account launched on Monday, it\u2019s already been verified.\n\nPrior to joining Instagram, Hewitt primarily used Twitter to interact with her fans \u2014 and even then, her interactions were a bit few and far between. The actress, who has recently appeared on television shows like Criminal Minds and her latest drama, The Client List, wanted to share a few fun eclipse-related pictures and decided that starting a fresh new social media account was the best option.\n\nHewitt has already mastered the art of Instagram slideshows, showing she\u2019s an Instagram natural.\n\nHer second photo in that series is actually a quote from Dalai Lama XIV, and we can see why she shared it.\n\n\"There are only two days in the year that nothing can be done. One is called yesterday and the other is called tomorrow, so today is the right day to love, believe, do and mostly live,\" the quote reads.\n\nShe also shared a photo of her dog, Duke, safely enjoying the view.\n\nHewitt also uploaded a video that showcased her pretty incredible cooking skills.\n\nSo, now we know what she\u2019s doing when she\u2019s not on set. Hopefully Jennifer Love Hewitt becomes as obsessed with Instagram as we are, since we\u2019d love to see more about what her life is like. (And of course, more adorable dog photos wouldn\u2019t hurt!)", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10073851/maisie-williams-pink-e1562769578725.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/27124705/chrissy-teigen-e1551300439853.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/08/06083904/Beyonce-e1533569975604.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09111854/ariana-grande-vogue-cover-e1562696343474.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072538/avatar-f-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12082251/jade-tolbert1-e1562945630169.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12114552/miley-cyrus-sexism-e1562957164576.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/26071400/Mindy.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/22015143/jennifer-love-hewitt.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01070809/Kylie-Jenner-Jordyn-Woods.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/10115634/kim-kardashian-psalm-west-pic-e1562858597437.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/05073153/Shay-Mitchell-Pregnant.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08072854/Baby-Archie-Meghan-Markle-and-Prince-Harry.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11150209/arianagrandepolitical.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08082331/Mindy-Kaling-Bikini.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08082004/ariana-grande-tour-e1562599214825.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/05085552/Fourth-of-July.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12065649/Reese-Witherspoon-and-Selma-Blair.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10074216/gettyimages-1160065700-e1562771408891.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27103420/pink-cropped.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/03070815/miley-cyrus-e1562861696992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/22015143/jennifer-love-hewitt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jennifer-love-hewitt-finally-joined-instagram-and-her-first-posts-are-epic/", "title": "Jennifer Love Hewitt finally joined Instagram, and her first posts are epic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "dogs,eclipse,hellogiggles,instagram,karen belz,pets,Pets", "news_keywords": "dogs,eclipse,hellogiggles,instagram,karen belz,pets,Pets", "description": "Jennifer Love Hewitt decided that this week would be the perfect time to join Instagram.", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Love Hewitt finally joined Instagram, and her first posts are epic", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jennifer-love-hewitt-finally-joined-instagram-and-her-first-posts-are-epic/", "description": "Welcome to Instagram, Jennifer!", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/22015143/jennifer-love-hewitt.jpg", "width": 656, "height": 985}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jennifer-love-hewitt-finally-joined-instagram-and-her-first-posts-are-epic/", "description": "Jennifer Love Hewitt decided that this week would be the perfect time to join Instagram.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/22015143/jennifer-love-hewitt.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/jennifer-love-hewitt-finally-joined-instagram-and-her-first-posts-are-epic/", "title": "Jennifer Love Hewitt finally joined Instagram, and her first posts are epic", "description": "Welcome to Instagram, Jennifer!", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/22015143/jennifer-love-hewitt.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
