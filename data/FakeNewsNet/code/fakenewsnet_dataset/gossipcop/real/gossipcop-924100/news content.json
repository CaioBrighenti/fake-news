News at the annual Alliance for Children\u2019s Rights dinner in Beverly Hills on Wednesday, March 28, when asked about the 25-year-old\u2019s current relationship status. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\n\nThe mother-daughter duo have had a strained relationship for months. Teefey told the website Gossip Cop in January that she was \u201cnot happy\u201d about Gomez\u2019s decision to reunite with Bieber, 24, after the \u201cWolves\u201d singer\u2019s split from The Weeknd months earlier. Still, Teefey added, \u201cSelena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy. \u2026 Every mother and daughter has disagreements.\u201d\n\nGomez\u2019s mom later wrote on Facebook, \u201cI will always be her mother. If she hasn\u2019t muttered anger about me than [sic] I have not done my job as a mother.\u201d\n\nTwo months later, multiple sources told Us Weekly exclusively that the Wizards of Waverly Place alum and the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d crooner were taking yet another break, in part because of Teefey\u2019s disapproval.\n\n\u201c[Selena\u2019s] relationship with Justin has really affected her relationship with her mom, and it\u2019s been hard for her because she is super close with her mom,\u201d one insider told Us in March. \u201cJustin and Selena decided to take a break to give her family some more time to heal and take in the idea of her and Justin being a couple again.\u201d\n\nSince then, Gomez and Bieber have been spending time with other people. She vacationed in Sydney, Australia, with a group of friends in mid-March, while he has been spotted out and about on numerous occasions with model Baskin Champion.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bieber-selena.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez6.jpg?crop=149px%2C98px%2C1509px%2C853px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez6.jpg?crop=144px%2C107px%2C1517px%2C797px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez6.jpg?crop=144px%2C107px%2C1517px%2C797px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomezs-mom-responds-to-justin-bieber-relationship-rumors/", "title": "Selena Gomez\u2019s Mom Responds to Justin Bieber Relationship Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Selena Gomez\u2019s mom, Mandy Teefey, spoke about the rumors surrounding her daughter\u2019s on-off relationship with Justin Bieber in a new interview \u2014 find out what she said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez\u2019s Mom Responds to Justin Bieber Relationship Rumors", "description": "Selena Gomez\u2019s mom, Mandy Teefey, spoke about the rumors surrounding her daughter\u2019s on-off relationship with Justin Bieber in a new interview \u2014 find out what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomezs-mom-responds-to-justin-bieber-relationship-rumors/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez6.jpg?crop=144px%2C107px%2C1517px%2C797px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez6.jpg?crop=144px%2C107px%2C1517px%2C797px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Selena Gomez"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-30T16:31:06+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Selena Gomez\u2019s mom, Mandy Teefey, spoke about the rumors surrounding her daughter\u2019s on-off relationship with Justin Bieber in a new interview \u2014 find out what she said", "title": "Selena Gomez\u2019s Mom Responds to Justin Bieber Relationship Rumors", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez6.jpg?crop=144px%2C107px%2C1517px%2C797px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522427466.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
