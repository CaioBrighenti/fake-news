They put their first daughter, Carly, up for adoption in 2009, and had a second daughter, Novalee, in 2015. Their family tree is probably the most straight-forward one in the whole Teen Mom franchise. Well, except for that whole Catelynn's-mom-married-Tyler's-dad thing, making them step-siblings. The couple also has legal custody of Catelynn's younger sister Sarah, who's now an adult. Rumor had it they were trying for more children, but after suffering from a miscarriage just a few months ago, they may have put those plans on pause.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jenelle-evans-family-tree-2.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jenelle-evans-family-tree-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/catelynn-lowell-family-tree.jpg?fit=200%2C1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jade-Cline.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/David-Eason-Dog-Killing-Jenelle-Denies-Nugget-Shot-Promo.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Teen-Mom-OG-Amber-Portwood-Domestic-Violence-Incident-11.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Amber-Portwood-Shawn-Defends-Legal-Troubles-01.jpg?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jenelle-evans-family-tree-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea Duff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/jenelle-evans-kids-149000/", "title": "Jenelle Evans Kids: See Her and the Rest of the Teen Mom Family Trees", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Thanks to her marriage to David Eason, Jenelle Evans now has like five kids.
