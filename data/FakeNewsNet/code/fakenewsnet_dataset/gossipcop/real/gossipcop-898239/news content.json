Swift's critics were the first people to use it, of course. They dubbed her a \"snake\" in summer 2016 after Kardashian leaked a video of Kanye West and Swift discussing his song \"Famous.\" To recap, West included some pointed lyrics about Swift in the song, of which she said she didn't give her OK. But then Kardashian leaked audio that showed Swift seemingly approving the line where West says they had sex; Swift, however, says it was the \"that bitch\" line she didn't greenlight and had issues with. Who was right or wrong in this scenario is irrelevant. Swift's reputation took a hit as a result\u2014hence her new album\u2014and the general public branded her a liar.\n\nAfter the incident Swift's social media feeds were quickly spammed with the snake emoji. But the singer reclaimed the image in 2017 when she released her song \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" It then became a source of power for Swift's fans\u2014and something they used against Kardashian. That's presumably why the reality star blocked the use of the emoji on her Instagram: The Swifties kept bombarding her with it.\n\nAnd now the drama's continuing (groan) with a brand new emoji: the rat. Here's what's going on. I'm sure you all remember that West's \"Famous\" video included a naked wax figure of Swift. Well, Kardashian posted a throwback photo featuring the \"Famous\" image that included the Swift figure in it, and the pop star's fans were not pleased. They quickly started spamming Kardashian's Instagram with rat emojis because \"snakes eat rats.\"\n\nCheck out the photo in question, below:\n\nAnd here are some of the responses.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a269efbea6b6940bb9038e7/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/KIM-TAYLOR.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a26a0e58cfe210577ba6034/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/kim2.png", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d971f11040d8257aedec62/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/pne%2520day.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a26a0ab5b0bbf05717ba23a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/kim3.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ca4e5c1053aa86e1b7bb6e2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/this-is-us.JPG", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d06a1d083e26e2e67bd04bf/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kristian%2520cardenas%2520fb.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a269efbea6b6940bb9038e7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/KIM-TAYLOR.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d029429b1802aa6cb653e16/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/MCDSPWO_EC004.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a26a0ab8cfe210577ba6032/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/kim1.png"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a269efbea6b6940bb9038e7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/KIM-TAYLOR.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Anna Moeslein", "Christopher Rosa", "Jessica Radloff", "Christopher Ros", "Marci Robin", "Julyssa Lopez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-fans-spamming-kim-kardashian-instagram-with-rat-emoji", "title": "Taylor Swift Fans Are Now Spamming Kim Kardashian's Instagram With the Rat Emoji", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "The drama between Taylor Swift and Kim Kardashian's fans isn't over yet.
