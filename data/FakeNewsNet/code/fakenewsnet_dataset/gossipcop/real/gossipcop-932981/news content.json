The 19-year-old artist has also been rumored to have dated ex-Fifth Harmony singer Camila Cabello, with the two denying a relationship but often appearing playful and flirty together. Those rumors persisted as recently as February, when Mendes and Cabello were spotted holding hands at a pizza restaurant in New York City.\n\nSee more on Mendes in the video below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nPICS: Shawn Mendes' Sweet New Snap With Hailey Baldwin Fuels Dating Rumors\n\nRELATED: Camila Cabello Is 'Crying' Over Shawn Mendes' Comments About Her -- See What He Said!\n\nWATCH: Behind the Scenes of 'The Voice' With Alicia Keys and Adviser Shawn Mendes (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-05/ariana_kim_metgala2018.jpg?itok=sR61gZfr&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/modules/contrib/ctd_uvp/img/placeholder.gif", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/gettyimages-955757896.jpg?itok=6tz6az8f", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-05/gettyimages-955757896.jpg?itok=X19ApidB"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-05/gettyimages-955757896.jpg?itok=6tz6az8f", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meredith B.
