Ryan Phillippe was also expected to attend the glamorous event.\n\nAlso making her debut at the shindig this year, reportedly, is Steve Harvey\u2019s 20-year-old stepdaughter, Lori Harvey.\n\nOther American celebrity spawn to swan at the ball in the past include: Warren Beatty\u2019s and Annette Bening\u2019s daughter Ella Beatty, artist Cy Twombly\u2019s granddaughter Maia Twombly, Pat Cleveland\u2019s daughter Anna Cleveland, Kyra Kennedy, Sylvester Stallone\u2019s daughter Sophia Stallone, and Larry David\u2019s daughter Romy David.\n\nMeanwhile, Cindy Crawford\u2019s 16-year-old daughter Kaia Gerber, who like Phillippe bears a striking resemblance to her mother, took to Instagram to jokingly declare \u201cI just don\u2019t see the resemblance\u201d.\n\nIn the photo where Gerber poses with her model mother, 51, the similarity between the two is uncanny.\n\nGerber is following in her mother\u2019s footsteps with a career in modelling, with the teenager making waves at her first New York Fashion Week appearance earlier this year.\n\nShe may have only just started her career, but the young model has also appeared on a number of magazine covers, including Vogue, and walked the runway for Burberry, Moschino, Chanel and Valentino.", "images":
