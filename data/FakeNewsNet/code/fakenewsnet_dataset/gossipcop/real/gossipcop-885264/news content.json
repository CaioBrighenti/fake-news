I was actually just trying to make something personal and like a diary.\"[6]\n\nSingles [ edit ]\n\n\"Too Good at Goodbyes\" was released as the album's lead single on 8 September 2017. It topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100.[3]\n\n\"One Last Song\" was sent to radio in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2017, on the day of album release as its second single.[7][8]\n\nOn 27 March 2018, Smith announced that \"Pray\" would serve as the third single, and would feature newly recorded guest vocals from American rapper Logic.

On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72 based on 16 reviews.[37]\n\nNeil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the album four stars, and was highly positive about it and Smith's vocals, calling them \"supernatural\" and saying: \"The Thrill of It All doesn't just wallow in love's misery, it practically drowns in the stuff. Its 10 songs are almost unrelentingly miserable, self-absorbed and self-pitying, verging on the lachrymose and sentimental (as lovers in the midst of a break-up often are). The instrumentation is understated piano and strings blended with just the occasional hint of contemporary hip-hop effects. At times, Smith's lyrics display a slightly clunking prosaicness. There's not much poetry in lines such as 'real love is never a waste of time' or 'there\u2019' no insurance to pay for the damage'. Yet it all hits home, because Smith makes every note sound like a matter of life and death. 'Him' is the album\u2019s centrepiece, a gospel drama addressed to a judgmental 'father', insisting on Smith's right to love whom he chooses. It is a kind of hymn to Him, and as the choir powers up it gains a righteous glory.\"[39] Andy Gill from The Independent also gave a four-star review, and shared in the positivity about the album, remarking: \"Smith's voice remains a thing of wonder throughout\".[42]\n\nWill Hermes for Rolling Stone also gave a positive four-star review, and said: \"Doubling down on his magnificent, gender-nonconforming voice while pushing his songcraft forward, Smith's second LP knights one of the mightiest, most expressive vocalists of his generation.\"[46] In another positive review Nick Levine from NME compared Smith to Adele in his review of the album, stating: \"Both have become enormously successful by singing emotional ballads that connect with huge numbers of people, and both are understandably reluctant to raise the tempo as a result. But like Adele's 25, this is an undeniably accomplished album that will, deservedly, shift a helluva lot of copies.[43] AllMusic's Andy Kellman was positive too in his three and a half-star review, and opined: \"this album maintains a consistency and intensity that places it slightly above the debut.\"[38]\n\nSome reviews were more negative. Though making it his album of the week and giving it three stars, Alexis Petridis from The Guardian was more mixed in his review, writing: \"There\u2019s a certain power to \"The Thrill of It All\" but it could have been a much more potent album if they\u2019d laid off the polish just a little.\"[41] Kitty Empire from The Observer was less enthusiastic in a more negative two-star review, claiming Smith was \"moping by numbers\" like Adele, and surmised: \"There is little drama here, just plenty of shorthand (sad pianos), a total absence of risk\"[44]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nPublication Accolade Rank Ref.
