As far as I know, no one has made a decision.\u201d\n\nReps for Bravo confirm to PEOPLE that \u201cnothing official has been determined\u201d regarding Flipping Out. They had no comment on the status of Lewis\u2019s contract, which expired on October 15.\n\nRELATED: Flipping Out\u2019s Jeff Lewis Lists $8 Million Hollywood House He First Bought for $860,000\n\nImage zoom Gage Edward, Jeff Lewis and Jenni Pulos Bravo\n\nThough Lewis has yet to hear anything, he recognizes the timing hasn\u2019t been great for a renewal.\n\nIn recent months, the Jeff Lewis Design owner has been at the center of two major controversies. He came under fire in June, when the surrogate who carried his and partner Gage Edward\u2019s daughter Monroe, now almost 2, sued the couple, Bravo and Flipping Out\u2019s production company, Authentic Entertainment, for allegedly filming her delivery without her permission, among other issues.\n\nThen in September, just before Flipping Out\u2018s premiere, PEOPLE exclusively reported that Lewis had parted ways with his friend of nearly 20 years and co-star Jenni Pulos, after a huge fight that he says was caught on film and will be part of the show\u2019s current season. Lewis claims Pulos reported him to Bravo for \u201cabuse and victimization\u201d and later wrongful termination.\n\nImage zoom Megan Weaver, Jeff Lewis and Jenni Pulos on Flipping Out Nicole Wilder/Bravo/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI understand the timing was not right for Bravo,\u201d Lewis said on Jeff Lewis Live. \u201cMy contract happens to expire before the rest of the season airs. I would think you might want to air the season a little sooner before the contract expires so that way you can decide whether or not you want to pick up the show.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed that Bravo had previously picked up Flipping Out in the middle of airing a season. \u201cThere have been times when they picked up the show right after episode 3 airs,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes they do it quickly, sometimes not as quickly. As far as I know, there\u2019s been no definitive answer.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jeff Lewis Introduces His New Intern: His Daughter Monroe!\n\nStill, Lewis is not holding his breath. \u201cThey\u2019re also not going to send an email and say, \u2018We\u2019ve decided not to pick up your show.\u2019 They just go dark as far as I know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be nice to hear from an upper level executive, with flowers or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is personal,\u201d he later admitted of the network allowing the lapse. \u201cMy feelings are hurt. I\u2019m not feeling important to them right now. I\u2019ve been with them for 11 years. I\u2019ve done three shows for them. I\u2019ve worked my ass off for them, and I\u2019m not feeling important because they don\u2019t seem to care that my contract is expired and that tomorrow I could be somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t give a s\u2014,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd considering right now, they\u2019re launching this whole Bravo Home [initiative] \u2014 which I think is a great idea. Is this the time to let your anchor remodeling show lapse?\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jeff Lewis Jeff Lewis Instagram\n\nLewis has been open about the fact that his Bravo contract was expiring on Oct. 15. On Monday, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram showing him standing next to a white board bearing his photo to which he\u2019d added the words \u201cContract EXPIRED!\u201d written across the top, with a big red X drawn across his face.\n\nNo matter what happens, Lewis said on Jeff Lewis Live that he believes that \u201cwhen one door closes, another door opens\u201d and he \u201cwill manifest somewhere else.\u201d\n\nAnd, he confessed, he did take at least one \u201cbig meeting,\u201d claiming that he did not have a non-compete clause in his contract. \u201cI want people to know that I\u2019m a free agent, absolutely,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nImage zoom Jeff Lewis Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage\n\nBut don\u2019t think that means Lewis wouldn\u2019t want to stay at Bravo if he could.\n\n\u201cI do really like everybody at Bravo,\u201d he said, reading a text message exchange he had with Bravo boss Andy Cohen. \u201cI\u2019m always open to working with and for Bravo. There is no ill will from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not be here sitting in this room if it weren\u2019t for them,\u201d Lewis added, separately. \u201cI have absolutely nothing but gratitude for them and I understand what they\u2019ve done for me. If it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over and I can hopefully land somewhere else.\u201d\n\nFlipping Out airs Tuesdays (10 p.m. ET) on Bravo. Jeff Lewis Live airs Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays (11 a.m. ET) on SiriusXM\u2019s Radio Andy (Ch. 102).", "images":
