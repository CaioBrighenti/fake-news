The hip-hop mogul is facing at least 13 accusations of sexual harassment and rape, and is the subject of a New York City police department special victims unit investigation.\n\nRussell Simmons steps down from companies after new sex assault allegation Read more\n\nSimmons has repeatedly denied accusations against him, including in court documents filed on 4 April, in which he denied raping film-maker Jennifer Jarosik, who attempted to sue him for $5m (\u00a33.68m) \u2013 the lawsuit was later dismissed. In a statement posted to his Instagram account as the caption to an image that stated, \u201cShoutout to black women just because\u201d, Simmons reiterated this position, but accepted the net benefits of the #MeToo movement: \u201cA little blood on my shoulders so that my daughters see a better world is worth it.\u201d\n\nHe paid tribute to black women, who \u201chave bared [sic] the biggest burden\u201d, and the \u201cunequal\u201d treatment of women \u201cof ALL RACES and RELIGONS [sic]\u201d, and suggested that \u201cwithout guidance from the feminine forces then men will destroy the planet\u201d.\n\nAt least seven women have accused Simmons of sexual assault, including fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone, and at least six women have accused him of rape. In November 2017, Simmons stepped down from his role in Def Jam records, the label he cofounded with Rick Rubin, along with his yoga lifestyle brand, other media properties and CNNMoney. HBO removed his name from All Def Comedy, a series he created to showcase up-and-coming comedians.\n\nIn response to allegations of sexual assault from screenwriter Jenny Lumet last November, Simmons wrote: \u201cWhile her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real. While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely apologise.\u201d\n\nFollowing four further accusations of rape in December 2017, Simmons posted another now-deleted statement to Instagram, pledging to clear his name: \u201cToday, I begin to properly defend myself. I will prove without any doubt that I am innocent of all rape charges,\u201d Simmons posted, beneath an image that read #NOTME.\n\n\u2018I miss the old Kanye\u2019: what has happened to rap\u2019s most complex star? Read more\n\nSimmons has also used his Instagram account to ask people to help rapper Kanye West, who has asserted, among other claims, that slavery \u201csounds like a choice\u201d. West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, have said that speculation about West\u2019s mental health is invasive.\n\nSimmons suggested West was \u201cunravelling in public\u201d, and called on the hip-hop community to support him: \u201cI refuse to believe a black man who supports black empowerment but now says \u2018Slavery was a choice\u2019 is operating with a healthy state of mind,\u201d
