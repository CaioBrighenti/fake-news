In a trailer for the upcoming new episodes, Chelsea Houska, Kailyn Lowry, and Leah Messer threaten to quit the MTV reality series if the drama with their co-stars Jenelle Evans and Briana DeJesus doesn't end. Watch the video above to find out what went down!\n\nIt's no secret the girls have had their issues through the years \u2014 but lately, the nonstop fights are beyond intense. The girls called out Jenelle's husband, David Eason, for tweeting insensitive comments about the LGBT community, which eventually got him fired from the show. The married couple has been firing back ever since, from branding Chelsea as \"boring\" and questioning Leah's parenting choices after she allowed her daughter to wear a full face of makeup for her cheerleading competition.\n\nOn the other hand, Briana and Kail had issues after Bri started dating Javi Marroquin. \"Kail was never my friend,\" the mother-of-two previously tweeted. \"I was always closer to Javi. I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to share my story and keep it moving.\" Regardless, the Hustle and Heart author felt Briana broke \"girl code\" for dating her ex \u2014 considering they all work together.\n\nSeason 9 of Teen Mom 2 premiered on Monday, May 7 \u2014 and we're definitely in for one heck of a ride this season. Elsewhere in the trailer, Leah admits to hooking up with her ex-husband Jeremy Calvert, while Chelsea cries after her first baby daddy Adam Lind's mom was rude to her at a custody hearing regarding her eight-year-old daughter, Aubree.
