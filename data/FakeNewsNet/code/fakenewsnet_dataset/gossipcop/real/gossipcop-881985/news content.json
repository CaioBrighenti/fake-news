News.\n\nLooks like she\u2019s just happy to get it all out there and move forward with her life. \u201cIt feels really good to just exhale, release it all into the world with love and keep it moving,\" Fergie said.\n\nShe spoke about her new project, Double Dutchess, and the effort it took to put it together. She says the inspiration behind the songs comes from \u201clife experiences\u201d and \u201cexploring different themes.\u201d\n\nShe echoed similar sentiments during an interview with The Breakfast Squad, where she tearfully talked about one of the songs, \u201cLove Is Pain.\"\n\n\"Feelings are feelings. They have to come out somewhere,\" she said about the new album. \"I'm a firm believer in that and writing is a really healthy way for you to express your feelings and that's how I've always done it.\u201d\n\nRegardless of their marriage ending, Fergie still has great things to say about Josh\u2019s parenting with their four-year-old son Axl. \"He's been amazing. He's been wonderful,\" she told E! News' Jason Kennedy. \"It's just been a natural experience with Axl. I'm just fascinated by his mind.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIE1-3.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIEWIDE-4.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GN_Collagen-BoxStick.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-24-at-5.25.08-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-fight-marriage-boot-camp-drama-hero.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AT-THROATS.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_couples.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_news.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-drama-tension-ok-pp-1.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIE4-2.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIE3-3.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIEWIDE-4.jpg?fit=1200%2C596&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SPENCER-TALKS-ABOUT-SISTER.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIE1-copy.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TREAD-LIGHTLY.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Unknown.jpeg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SPENCER-TALKS-ABOUT-AUDRINA.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GN_LOGO.jpg?fit=100%2C25&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SUMMER-TRENDS-1.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BRODY-AND-KARDASHIANS.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIE5-1.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIE2-3.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NOT-IN-LOVE.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/the-hills-pp-3.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/FERGIEWIDE-4.jpg?fit=1200%2C596&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["September"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/fergie-doing-great-josh-duhamel/", "title": "Fergie \u2018Doing Great\u2019 Following Split With Ex-Husband Josh Duhamel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "The couple recently ended their marriage after eight years together.", "news_keywords": "Fergie", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Fergie \u2018Doing Great\u2019 Following Split With Ex-Husband Josh Duhamel", "url": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/fergie-doing-great-josh-duhamel/", "description": "Fergie is keeping her chin up and staying positive after news broke that her marriage with Josh Duhamel was ending after eight years.
