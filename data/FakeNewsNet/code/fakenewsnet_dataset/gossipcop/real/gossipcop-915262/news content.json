And hopefully it will be a fitting remembrance and recognition of what happened, which was so terrible.\u201d\n\nFormer Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher is rumored to step in for the pop star during the tribute.\n\nGrande hosted a televised benefit concert titled One Love Manchester in June 2017 in honor of the victims and families affected by the bombing. Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Niall Horan, Katy Perry, Robbie Williams and Coldplay were among the many artists who took the stage. Grande broke down in tears while closing out the show with a cover of \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d The concert raised more than $13 million.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
