Instead, the two long-married country-music stars have developed a manner of speaking that can only be described as down-right harmonious, with each supplying an instrumental part of the whole. Consider, for example, the way they talk about the first time they saw the future site of their beloved Bahamas home. \u201cThere was just a little shack,\u201d McGraw recalls, \u201cthat someone\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were friends of the owner,\u201d Hill interjects. \u201c\u2014\u2014had sort of floated up onto the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a great little place.\u201d\n\n\u201cA great little place,\u201d he agrees, \u201cand it was the only thing there. When we decided to buy, they just floated the shack away. . . .\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the couple\u2019s own settling-in process was a bit more involved. Hill and McGraw first purchased the private 20-acre island they call \u201cL\u2019\u00eele d\u2019Anges\u201d back in 2003; they didn\u2019t move into the house\u2014actually a collection of eight distinct \u201cpavilions,\u201d connected by thatch-roofed loggias\u2014until 2012. \u201cWe were a little bit naive, possibly,\u201d Hill admits, \u201cas to what\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014what the undertaking really meant,\u201d McGraw concludes.\n\n'The house is functional, but it really blends into the environment,' says McGraw.\n\n\u201cWe set out to build a house. We had no idea we had to build everything else.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWe basically had to build a little town.\u201d\n\nPhoto by William Abranowicz\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have staff houses,\u201d he says, meaning shelter for the original construction workers as well as the current caretakers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have infrastructure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have water.\u201d\n\n\u201cWater. Electricity. You don\u2019t quite put all that together at first.\u201d\n\nFor help, they turned to McAlpine, an architecture\u2013and\u2013interior design firm that had previously worked on their homes in Nashville and Franklin, Tennessee. According to architect Bobby McAlpine, who designed the compound with his partner Greg Tankersley, the main question\u2014aside from the very practical ones suggested above, of course\u2014was \u201cWhat does paradise look like for a couple of creative people like them?\u201d In its raw state, the island \u201cwas already otherworldly, with this clear water and white, white sand. I thought, In paradise, you live in ways you can\u2019t live in civilization. So every room is a separate building,\u201d he says, linked by open-air passageways. \u201cYou can bathe outdoors or climb a tower and feel that you\u2019re being lifted up into the air. All these sort of romantic ideas, we got a shot at doing here, and we took them.\u201d\n\n'In paradise you live in ways you can't in civilization,' says architect Bobby McAlpine.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to feel connected to the outside,\u201d Hill explains. \u201cWhen the breeze comes through the room, it's just life-changing.\" She laughs, perhaps at the hyperbole, and then doubles down. \"It really is! It's something for the soul.\"", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d14c7086036b50008c0cc96/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/01%2520New%2520Museum_Daytime%2520View%2520Down%2520Prince%2520Street_OMA%2520and%2520Bloom-web.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d0bb7c954d1b1089590f282/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/OT1247633.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d1b6f4bb4a2e8000976aaf3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/4revised.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee2276577bc169da97bc8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL07-01.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-reverse.13d6d4955ed232771a3c921b77513eaddd3ac58b.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee233077afe6e41db3930/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL06-01.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee234077afe6e41db3933/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL06-02.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-header.4beb0fb9c7bbd6bb98b552777bf0f8c6e71764c1.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee234077afe6e41db3934/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL06-03.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee234077afe6e41db3936/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL09-9A.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/593ab49258381603535673b7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/AD%25252007.17%252520COVER.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee232077afe6e41db392c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL02-01.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d14feb3c5fc2900088c98be/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/050919AD_RobinTunneyHomeTour0792.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59383e3e3176b35c589a6b0d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Exteriors_1817.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5c80381c908d5f2d968dfeee/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/coke-bartrina-06.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee232077afe6e41db392c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL02-01.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Sydney Wasserman", "Fred A.
