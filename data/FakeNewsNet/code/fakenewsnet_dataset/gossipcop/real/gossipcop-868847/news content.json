Now that the bride-to-be has already found her dream dress (she won't spill major deets, but she was inspired by Grace Kelly's gorgeous gown) AND picked a wedding date, Bella is giving even more updates as she and her hubby-to-be plan their dream ceremony. In a new interview, the 33-year-old revealed that sissy Brie's daughter, Birdie Joe Danielson, will be part of the wedding party. And\u2014you guessed it\u2014as the flower girl!\n\n\"John has three nieces, so we're going to have them as flower girls and then my brother's little girl Vivienne and then Birdie,\" Nikki told E! News at Comic-Con. \"We'll probably get Birdie a really special dress.\"\n\nSister Brie continued, \"Yes, we have to! We have to make sure she says yes to the dress.\"\n\nSee More: Prince William Reveals He Felt His Late Mother Princess Diana's Spirit at His Wedding\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nBella found her dress late last week, and couldn't help but contain her excitement during a previous interview with the entertainment source. \"I said yes to the dress!\" Nikki gushed. \"You know, what's crazy is when I was at the spring fashion shows and I attended Marchesa and when I looked at that line, like she got me when they handed we a glass of Perrier Jouet and a macaroon. I was like, \u2018OK, yes.' And then I saw this dress and I was like, \u2018That's Princess Grace Kelly.' Like that is what I want so bad. And so all the girls warned me, \u2018Just so you know, like even though you love it sometimes when you try something on it doesn't work.' I put it on and I was like this is the one. It was amazing.\"\n\nThe Total Divas star seemed to have a change of heart about the gown's initial design , as she once dreamed of a cleavage-baring, form-fitting dress. But, here's hoping little Birdie says yes to her dress!", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/59778cbb502bca70c7553f9e/1:1/w_767/nikki-bella.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5bcf6f3579af786117e8b5f0/1:1/w_125/rachel-barnes-and-matthew-cooper-wedding29.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/59778cbb502bca70c7553f9e/master/pass/nikki-bella.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5bec6441c6ac5e0609c87ec7/1:1/w_125/bridesmaid-dresses-under-100-asos.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5d179c598b9e6100081c0f3a/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1153797221.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/59778cbb502bca70c7553f9e/master/pass/nikki-bella.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/nikki-bella-john-cena-niece-flower-girl", "title": "Nikki Bella's Niece Will Serve as Flower Girl During Her Wedding to John Cena", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a new interview, Nikki Bella revealed her niece Birdie will serve as flower girl during her wedding to John Cena.", "og": {"description": "Little Birdie has to say yes to the dress, first!", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/59778cbb502bca70c7553f9e/master/pass/nikki-bella.jpg", "title": "Nikki Bella's Niece Will Serve as Flower Girl During Her Wedding to John Cena", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/nikki-bella-john-cena-niece-flower-girl", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Little Birdie has to say yes to the dress, first!", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/59778cbb502bca70c7553f9e/master/pass/nikki-bella.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Nikki Bella's Niece Will Serve as Flower Girl During Her Wedding to John Cena", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/nikki-bella-john-cena-niece-flower-girl", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "john cena,nikki bella,celebrity wedding", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,john cena,nikki bella,celebrity wedding"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
