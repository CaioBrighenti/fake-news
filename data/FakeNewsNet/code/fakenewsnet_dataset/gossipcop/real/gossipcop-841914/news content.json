As she swapped outfits from one appearance to the next, her style staples of the day were her Louis Vuitton\u2019s crystal flower sandals that featured black suede baby goat leather and a transparent heel. You too can get the same shoe as Selena for $1,060.\n\nFor her first look, Gomez styled her Vuitton heels with a Jacquemus mini dress in the early morning. The navy ensemble was loose at the top and fitted through the body with a large button accenting the crossover V-neckline and split skirt. With a price tag of $696, the star\u2019s outfit cost nearly $2,000.\n\nNext, the 13 Reasons Why executive producer stopped by the Elvis Duran and The Morning Show. Wearing the same LV sandals, Gomez changed into a bright orange dress from Christopher Kane\u2019s pre-Fall 2017 collection. Her colorful look featured a deep V-neckline and a side slit.\n\nAfter, Gomez visited the SiriusXM studios for her Morning Mash Up interview wearing a black slip dress over a white tunic. Her Victor Glemaud resort ensemble was styled with Tura Inc sunglasses and her go-to Vuitton heels.\n\nThen, SelGo had all eyes on her when she opted for a matching neon pink-and-white printed polo shirt and pants set from Miu Miu\u2019s Fall 2017 ready-to-wear collection. She changed up her hairstyle by gathering her beach waves into a high ponytail, and she gave her Louis Vuitton heels a fashion break by changing into silver Gianvito Rossi heels.\n\nFROM PEN: Amandla Stenberg\u2019s Best Beauty Lesson Is One We All Need to Follow\n\nFor her final interview, the multi-hyphenate wore a long black-and-white striped dress and leather jacket at the Music Choice offices. Back again were the Louis Vuitton heels!\n\nTo wrap up her hectic day, Gomez dressed in a lacy black and white outfit by Opening Ceremony for a \u201cdate night\u201d with boyfriend, The Weeknd, at Rao\u2019s restaurant.\n\nSelena and The Weeknd with a fan in New York City tonight! pic.twitter.com/TE13wJWF8L \u2014 Selena Gomez News (@LifeWithSelG) June 6, 2017\n\nThe couple posed with several fans during their night out in NYC. No doubt, she will be cheering on The Weeknd at his Barclay Center concerts Monday and Tuesday evening.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lady-gaga-pride-1.jpg",
