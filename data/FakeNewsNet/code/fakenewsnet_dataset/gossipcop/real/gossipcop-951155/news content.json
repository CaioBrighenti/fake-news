Kim Zolciak caused an uproar with fans when she released a new song titled \u201cWig,\u201d on Wednesday, July 11, but despite rumors that the track was inspired by her Real Housewives of Atlanta frenemy NeNe Leakes, the singer exclusively tells Us Weekly that the anthem is not about her costar.\n\n\u201cWell, I mean, I\u2019ve worn wigs long before I ever met NeNe. I love wigs,\u201d the Don\u2019t Be Tardy star, 40, tells Us. \u201cMy mom\u2019s a hairdresser. I just love hair. I have great hair. I just love to like, play around with different hair and different styles, and I\u2019d rather fry the s\u2014t out of a wig than my own hair. \u2026 I\u2019ve been wearing wigs for 17 years. Yeah, so no that has nothing to really do with that.\u201d\n\nFans assumed Zolciak\u2019s latest track was about Leakes due to the The New Normal actress\u2019 frequent references to Zolciak as \u201cwig\u201d over the years on RHOA. The Kashmere founder adds that \u201cget off my wig\u201d is \u201cpretty much like f\u2014k off.\u201d\n\nIt is also not a term that Zolciak, who is currently working on a wig line, takes offense to: \u201cAt the end of it, people have dogged me out for so many years about wearing wigs, but so many people wear them now. It\u2019s like, I actually \u2026 I\u2019m a trendsetter. I feel like, versus you guys mocking me like, her wig, and calling me wig is, I mean, that\u2019s kind of funny in itself, but \u2026 yeah I mean, in essence, I guess it kind of is.\u201d\n\nZolciak also clarified that her lyric \u201cThirsty peachy, peachy / just can\u2019t help it / you\u2019re obsessed\u201c is not about Leakes, but haters in general.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m very comfortable with who I am. It\u2019s for all the haters,\u201d Zolciak tells Us. \u201cAnd obviously, yes, Atlanta, Georgia is a peach, but it\u2019s not directed towards anybody, in particular. It\u2019s more along the lines of just whoever the haters \u2026 to all of them. You thirsty peachy peaches. You\u2019re obsessed. \u2026 And that\u2019s written the way I walk, the way I talk, that\u2019s just how I live. My ask, believe, receive, like the way I walk, the way I talk, that\u2019s just how I live.\u201d\n\nDespite Zolciak and Leakes\u2019 rocky history, the two women appeared to temporarily put their differences aside last month when Leakes announced that her husband, Gregg Leakes, was diagnosed with cancer. The former Glee star revealed on June 20 via Instagram that Zolciak sent the couple a box of \u201cgoodies\u201d and called the gift \u201cso thoughtful.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Brody Brown\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kim-Zolciak-NeNe-Leakes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1711px%2C967px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kim-Zolciak-NeNe-Leakes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1711px%2C899px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kim-Zolciak-NeNe-Leakes.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1711px%2C899px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/is-kim-zolciaks-new-song-wig-inspired-by-nene-leakes/", "title": "Is Kim Zolciak\u2019s New Song \u2018Wig\u2019 Inspired by NeNe Leakes?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kim Zolciak released a new song titled \u2018Wig\u2019 and clarified exclusively to Us Weekly that she is not singing about her \u2018RHOA\u2019 frenemy NeNe Leakes \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Is Kim Zolciak\u2019s New Song \u2018Wig\u2019 Inspired by NeNe Leakes?
