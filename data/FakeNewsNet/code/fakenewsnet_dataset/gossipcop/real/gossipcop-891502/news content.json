All are due early next year.\n\n\u201cOh here, I can feel where this is going. She\u2019s trying to trick me into confirming pregnancies,\u201d Jenner said of DeGeneres.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/amazon-celeb-deals-tout.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/pullman3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kris.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/swift-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kourt-scott-kris.jpg?crop=0px%2C192px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/khloe-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kris-jenner-99-cent-store.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sophie-turner-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C435px%2C1537px%2C807px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jennifer-aniston-4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/screen-shot-2019-06-20-at-9.25.59-am.jpg?crop=163px%2C84px%2C2532px%2C1329px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kardashian-b.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/cardi-b-10.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1025115780.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/denise-richards.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/jermaine3.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bdp_3839.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ellen-toy-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/bottlecap-challenge-tout.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/barbra-streisand.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/hillary-duff1.jpg?crop=28px%2C122px%2C1126px%2C591px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/brody-3.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kris-jenner-99-cent-store.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kris-jenner-99-cent-store.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kris-jenner-ellen-degeneres-99-cents-only-store-prank/", "title": "Kris Jenner Hilariously Sent to a Dollar Store by Ellen DeGeneres", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kris jenner, ellen degeneres, the ellen show, 99 cents store, ellen's show me more show, dollar store, 99 cent", "news_keywords": "kris jenner, ellen degeneres, the ellen show, 99 cents store, ellen's show me more show, dollar store, 99 cent", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyHr0dwzD_U Kris Jenner\u00a0gets\u00a0a commission from her famous daughters' business deals, thus making her a bonafide millionaire.
