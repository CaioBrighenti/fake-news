(A local condom manufacturer is supplying 100,000 and another 10,000 will come from the Korean Association of AIDS Prevention.) With 2,925 athletes competing this year, that works out to 37 condoms per competitor.\n\nThere were only a paltry 100,000 condoms handed out at the 2010 Vancouver and 2014 Sochi games, but the Summer Olympics in Rio smashed that figure with a whopping 450,000 condoms. There are more athletes at the summer games, though, so that works out to 42 condoms per competitor.\n\nThe condoms in PyeongChang will be distributed between the Olympic Village, stadiums and even the media center. Most of them will be placed in baskets in bathrooms, according to the Korea Biomedical Review. That will make obtaining condoms a little more discrete than it was in Rio, where athletes complained that the vending machines were loud.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85", "https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/banners/v2/mobile/extramustard.png", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/swim-daily-newsletter.svg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/MMQB-newsletter.svg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/MMQB-newsletter-horizontal.svg", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1730_top1.jpg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/Extra-Mustard-newsletter.svg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/fansided-newsletter.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1730_top2.jpg", "https://www.si.com/img/icons/sportsIllustrated-newsletter.svg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Gartland"], "canonical_link": "https://www.si.com/olympics/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village", "title": "Winter Olympians Have Access to a Record Amount of Condoms", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "pyeongchang 2018,olympics,Winter Olympics,olympics condoms,winter olympics condoms,Olympics,extra mustard", "news_keywords": "pyeongchang 2018,olympics,Winter Olympics,olympics condoms,winter olympics condoms,Olympics,extra mustard", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-08 05:06:06", "sailthru.tags": "pyeongchang-2018,olympics,winter-olympics,olympics-condoms,winter-olympics-condoms,extra-mustard", "description": "There are more condoms at the Winter Olympics this year than ever before.", "og": {"title": "Winter Olympians have access to a record amount of condoms", "type": "article", "site_name": "SI.com", "url": "https://www.si.com/olympics/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village", "description": "There are more condoms at the Winter Olympics this year than ever before.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.si.com/olympics/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village", "description": "There are more condoms at the Winter Olympics this year than ever before.", "media": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village.jpg&w=1200&h=628&c=sc&poi=face&q=85"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.si.com/olympics/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village", "title": "Winter Olympians have access to a record amount of condoms", "description": "There are more condoms at the Winter Olympics this year than ever before.", "creator": "@Dan_Gartland", "image": "https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2018/02/08/pyeongchang-2018-condoms-olympic-village.jpg&w=1024&h=512&c=sc&poi=face&q=85"}, "fb": {"app_id": 165082593548215, "pages": 10053803772}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518066000.0, "source": "https://www.si.com", "summary": ""}
