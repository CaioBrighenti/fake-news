Right before that HOH competition, he had known that that was the anniversary of my dad\u2019s passing, so it was a very emotional day for me. And instead of being a kind and caring human being \u2014 because this is just a game \u2014 he decided to kick me while I was down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that that\u2019s disgusting and I don\u2019t stand by it,\u201d Jessica declared in no uncertain terms about Josh\u2019s controversial bullying. \u201cAnd I just don\u2019t like him as a person after that.\u201d Jessica was evicted with a vote of 7 to 1, with her live-in boyfriend Cody Nickson being the only person to cast a vote for Raven Walton; Elena Davies received zero votes to evict. Read our Episode 21 recap here.\n\nDoes Jessica acknowledge that she threw away her chance at the $500,000 prize for a relationship with Cody? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I gave up my game for Cody. We just thought alike. And because we thought so much alike, he was my partner in this game.\u201d Jessica then admitted, \u201cOf course I do,\u201d when Julie asked if she loved Cody.\n\nStill emotional, Jessica confessed, \u201cIt took half the season of just being attacked, lied to and back-stabbed for me to just give up. I put a lot of heart into certain relationships and friendships that I had with people in that house, and they lied to me several times and stabbed me in the back and let me down every chance that they had. So I just gave up.\u201d\n\nAlso in her \u201cBig Brother\u201d exit interview Jessica learned that Josh\u2019s real target was Elena, but that he only started campaigning against Jessica after the verbal attacks during the impromptu spelling bee. \u201cI am so happy I don\u2019t have to hear [Josh\u2019s] voice anymore,\u201d she responded. \u201cOh my God! He didn\u2019t give me any reason to believe that I wasn\u2019t the target, so I guess that was my fault.\u201d\n\nBe sure to make your predictions so that the contestants can see how they\u2019re faring in our racetrack odds.
