Let\u2019s talk about that\u2019 \u2013 and we are hurting as a country,\u201d Nettles continued. \u201cSo I hope that within the Latino community, people feel validated and seen with this song, and I hope that within the country at large it sends a message of unity.\u201d\n\nWith lyrics like, \u201cIt\u2019s true I wasn\u2019t born here / But my heart is sworn here / To hold up your dreams with my own / That day on my porch / I made it to church / And I prayed for each soul to fly home,\u201d the song pulls at the heart strings.\n\nListen to \u201cKing of the City\u201d above.", "images":
