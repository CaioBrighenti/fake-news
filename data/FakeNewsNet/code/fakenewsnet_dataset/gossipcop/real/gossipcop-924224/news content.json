The actor smoked cigarettes during the interview and told Colbert that he took a sedative before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing well. You\u2019ve inherited a little of the Ambien I had to take to get to sleep after a red-eye last night,\u201d Penn said at the start of his sitdown.\n\nImage zoom WENN\n\nA source told PEOPLE Penn doesn\u2019t mind being involved in controversy.\n\n\u201cSean doesn\u2019t care at all what people think,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe likes controversy and debate and doesn\u2019t mind shocking people.\u201d\n\nAccording to another source, \u201cSean is a one man band, always has been.
