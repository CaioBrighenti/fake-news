And this is me now.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Katy Perry rates her lovers during livestream and Diplo responds to being in last place\n\nPerry looks back at that period in her life as \u201c**king intense. And amazing and beautiful and horrible all at the same time,\u201d pointing out that Perry now, she explains, is simply the result of her own personal evolution over the years.\n\nThat evolution, she says, is constant and ongoing. \u201cEvery day when I think I know something, the universe shows me that I need to learn another lesson,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I stand here today, more so than any other day, saying I know nothing. I literally know nothing.\u201d\n\nYet reacting to the constant stream of social media criticism, she says, can be a \u201cmaddening game,\u201d adding: \u201cThey want you to stand for something, but once you do, and if you don\u2019t do it perfectly, they\u2019re ready to take you right down.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Katy Perry changes Taylor Swift \u2018Swish Swish\u2019 lyric, tears her pants during livestream concert\n\nShe describes her new album, Witness, as being perfectly reflective of where she\u2019s at now. \u201cIt\u2019s a departure, and it\u2019s a necessary evolution that I have to take,\u201d she says of her new direction.\n\n\u201cAnd I know that sometimes it feels publicly like I\u2019m dragging cement blocks, but like, the pyramids were made out of cement blocks \u2014 or not cement,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut do you know what I\u2019m trying to say? I\u2019m gonna get there.\u201d", "images": ["https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/chy102175254_high.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/20170604_kza_kw1_1227-1.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=282", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1003048220.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/social-impulse/large/facebook/national.gif", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/464/306/Paul_live_848x480_723113028000.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rcmp-pelican-narrows-youth-arrest.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/images/gnlive-ads/default.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagoncrashjuly11cbcresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005670&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/211/991/CAPTAIN_COOK_WEB_848x480_1568960579901.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/9572838.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/coast-guard.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1003048220.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/img_5882-e1562605151708.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/ad-choices.png", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/kroeker.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/19617757-e1535073439213.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stock-floor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1003048220.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/20170604_kza_kw1_1227-1.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/chuckwagonracecrashfridayresized.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=115&h=115&crop=1", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/florida-tongue-depressor.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=150", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/349/131/Global%20News__946999.png?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/raw_3gr0_botanical_sexism_1.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/shaw-globalnews/_img/logos/news_2x.png", "https://i2.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/495/99/STAMPEDE%20BACKLASH-PKG_CALG5173_1.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/media.globalnews.ca/videostatic/36/615/2019-07-12T05-05-04.1Z--1280x720.jpg?w=150&quality=70&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/20170604_kza_kw1_1227-1.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brent Furdyk"], "canonical_link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3530532/katy-perry-new-image/", "title": "Katy Perry responds to critics of her new image: \u2018I didn\u2019t con people\u2026 this is me now\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#133F6F", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Katy Perry responds to critics of her new image: \u2018I didn\u2019t con people\u2026 this is me now\u2019 -
