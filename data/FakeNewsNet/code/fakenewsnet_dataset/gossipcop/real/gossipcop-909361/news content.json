She concluded the performance by lying backward onto the fluffy instrument.\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full Grammys coverage to get the latest news on music\u2019s big night.\n\nJust hours before the show, Gaga shared a touching message on social media about how she was hoping to transform the \u201cdeep grief\u201d that inspired Joanne into \u201chope and healing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have carried a deep grief in my heart over my family\u2019s tragedy,\u201d she wrote, referring to her late aunt, Joanne Stefani Germanotta, who died of lupus complications at age 19.\n\nImage zoom\n\n\u201cThe loss of Joanne affected my father so deeply that it affected me. When he cried, I cried. When he was angry, I was angry. When he was hurt, I hurt,\u201d she continued.\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.
