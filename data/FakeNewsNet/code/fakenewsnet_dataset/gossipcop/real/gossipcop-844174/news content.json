Starting almost a full year ago, The Late Late Show\u2019s unflappable host James Corden debuted new fixture called \u201cDrop the Mic.\u201d The fun segment finds the Carpool Karaoke maestro turning his vocal stylings up a notch and dishing rap disses as he squares off against various guests. The stars bring it, too, and the resulting rap battles have been a study in badass rhyming, quick thinking, and \u2014 wait for it \u2014 mic dropping. The segment has become so popular, in fact, that an independent stand-alone spinoff is set to debut this fall.\n\nFor a full dose of heated rap battles, read on for a roundup of every \u201cDrop the Mic\u201d moment with MC Corden and his celebrity opponents.\n\n1. James Corden vs. Anne Hathaway\n\nFor the first round of \u201cDrop the Mic,\u201d Corden faced off against actress and singer Anne Hathaway, and they both went there. Corden teased the actress for her turn as Oscars host, and Hathaway mused that the late night host\u2019s wife watches Seth Meyers instead. Both players had to hand it to the other \u2014 Hathaway reluctantly nodded after a jab that \u201cthat was good,\u201d and Corden observed that her diss about his One Direction game \u201cwas actually mean.\u201d In the end, the audience\u2019s applause made it clear who dominated this round.\n\nWinner: Anne Hathaway\n\n2. James Corden vs. David Schwimmer vs. Rebel Wilson\n\nAfter the first round went so well, Corden and co. whipped up another segment just the next day, and included some surprises. What was supposed to be a match between Schwimmer and Corden became a three-way fight when Rebel Wilson showed up \u201ccompletely unannounced.\u201d Corden mined Friends and even The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story for material against Schwimmer, and in turn, the actor who brought Ross Geller to life played dirty, wondering why Corden\u2019s wife married him: \u201cMy bad, she blind?\u201d Rebel killed in the end, though, serving up barbs for Schwimmer (\u201cYour career\u2019s a mistake / It\u2019s like Ross and Rachel / It\u2019s on a break\u201d) and Corden (\u201cCarpool Karaoke, you think it\u2019s your big thing / But everyone is thinking, \u2018Shut up and let Adele sing!'\u201d).\n\nWinner: Rebel Wilson\n\nRELATED: Carpool Karaoke: James Corden\u2019s Most-Watched Videos\n\n3. James Corden vs. Kevin Hart\n\nCorden trotted out fellow funnyman Hart, and truly nothing was off the table. The host pulled out all the stops and made fun of Hart for his height (\u201cYou might think like a man / But you\u2019re built like a boy\u201d), even bringing out a step stool for the comic. Hart\u2019s response: a zesty \u201cGet that out my face!\u201d The Ride Along star wasn\u2019t going to be outdone, though, and did what many of the participants have done by criticizing Corden\u2019s career: \u201cI admit, most people nice to your face / Until they get home and realize you\u2019re not Ricky Gervais.\u201d\n\nWinner: Kevin Hart (Are we sensing a pattern here yet?)\n\n4. James Corden vs. Cara Delevingne vs. Dave Franco\n\nNext we saw another three-way showdown, as both Delevingne and Franco showed up to shut down Corden on his own turf. After some rather off-color jokes, Franco scored his best line: \u201cJames, your show ends at 1:30 every week / So hello to the pets whose owners fell asleep!\u201d Both Franco and Corden picked on Delevingne for her unusually robust eyebrows, but the unfazed actress and model targeted both of her opponents with one effective gibe: \u201cYou\u2019re both shorter than me / And I think that you will find / I\u2019ve hooked up with hotter girls than both of you combined.\u201d\n\nWinner: Cara Delevingne\n\n5. James Corden vs. Usain Bolt\n\nLast November, the \u201cDrop the Mic\u201d crew took things in a new direction, pairing Corden with Jamaican Gold medalist Usain Bolt. The two tried to intimidate each other, with Bolt assuring Corden, \u201cAll I do is win.\u201d Corden asked the athlete, \u201cYou sure you\u2019re ready for this? / \u2018Cause you\u2019re on my track now.\u201d Things started off nasty and went downhill from there, and the scales were definitely tipped against the TV host. Bolt took a swipe with this line: \u201cYou never shoulda started / You probably shoulda fled / I run my race in 10 seconds / You last that long in bed!\u201d And Corden came back with his own jab: \u201cWhen your endorsements dry up / Hey, you can call me / We always need more PAs to run and get me coffee!\u201d Good one, Corden, but in the end, the Olympic champion couldn\u2019t be beat.\n\nWinner: Usain Bolt\n\n6. James Corden vs. Riz Ahmed\n\nThe most recent matchup went down in April, with The Night Of star Riz Ahmed becoming the latest contestant to trade repartee with the British late night personality. Their jabs were both mean and topical, touching on Unites Airlines and Sean Spicer, but the best exchanges had to do with Ahmed in the Star Wars film Rogue One: \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s mean to say in Star Wars he stinks / He made me miss the days of Jar Jar Binks,\u201d taunted Corden. \u201cYeah, I did do Star Wars / I bet that made you mad / Too bad they weren\u2019t tryin\u2019 to cast Jabba the Hutt\u2019s dad,\u201d Ahmed rapped back. It was a pretty even match, but Ahmed swooped in with one last zinger: \u201cYour jokes on the mic are spent / I saw you at Coachella / You were the big white tent.\u201d\n\nWinner: Riz Ahmed", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/115096_0653b.jpg?crop=0px%2C182px%2C2700px%2C1418px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/115120-35.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/110588_0159b.jpg?crop=759px%2C40px%2C1142px%2C1141px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110302_0490b1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110302_0490b1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110302_0490b1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Heching"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/03/drop-mic-james-corden-videos/", "title": "Every time James Corden and stars have battled to 'Drop the Mic'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "James Corden, Riz Ahmed, Usain Bolt", "news_keywords": "James Corden, Riz Ahmed, Usain Bolt", "description": "The competition is stiff and the rhymes are harsh", "og": {"title": "Every Time James Corden and Stars Have Battled to 'Drop the Mic'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/03/drop-mic-james-corden-videos/", "description": "The competition is stiff and the rhymes are harsh", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110302_0490b1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/03/drop-mic-james-corden-videos/", "description": "The competition is stiff and the rhymes are harsh", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110302_0490b1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/05/03/drop-mic-james-corden-videos/", "title": "Every Time James Corden and Stars Have Battled to 'Drop the Mic'", "description": "The competition is stiff and the rhymes are harsh", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/110302_0490b1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MR2-vBYRjM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjCh1u8SQlE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/XfuTGjgDapw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Uh-f-eEudc", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQGgtVN0ZcI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MR2-vBYRjM"], "publish_date": 1493784000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
