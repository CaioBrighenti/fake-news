I like all the songs,\u201d she told local news outlet KSHB41 Action News.\n\nNot only does Stanaway love his music, but she also finds the singer to be very attractive. \u201cOh heavens, yes!\u201d Stanaway said after being asked if she thinks Bryan, 41, is handsome.\n\nFROM PEN: Learn The Process Behind Time Selecting The 100 Most Influential People\n\nStanaway \u2014 who wore a custom t-shirt that read \u201cShake It for Me, Luke!\u201d \u2014 was accompanied by her son, Vincent Sokolaski, his wife, Linda Sokolaski, and members of the Crossroads staff.\n\nRELATED: Celeb Quotes of the Day: Michelle Obama, Jessica Biel & More\n\n\u201cThis is probably the most excited she\u2019s been for six to seven months,\u201d explained Vincent Sokolaski.\n\n\u201cShe had the time of her life,\u201d her daughter-in-law Linda added.\n\nImage zoom LukeBryan.com\n\nImage zoom LukeBryan.com\n\nBryan\u2019s booty became so popular with fans, he\u2019s actually had to start a \u201cno touching\u201d policy at meet and greets.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll sneak one in on ya. It still happens \u2013 we\u2019ve learned to understand it,\u201d Bryan told Ellen DeGeneres back in September.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2019cause you see, like early on in your career, you don\u2019t want to tell your fans that they can\u2019t interact with you, so you let them get away with kisses on the cheek and all that,\u201d Bryan explained. \u201cSomeone will go, \u2018Can I grab your butt?\u2019 \u2026 and back then if it was a polite ask, we would oblige them. But then you got 90 others\u2026\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s country music. We make the fans happy.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/debbi-ryan.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630",
