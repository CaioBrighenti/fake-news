I\u2019m rehearing for the Super Bowl, rehearsing for the tour. I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t be there to kick off your birthday week,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know I\u2019d like to be there but I need to make sure we are great.\u201d\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not at all. The \u201cFilthy\u201d singer then serenaded DeGeneres\u2014with the help of his band The Tennessee Kids\u2014with a version of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and had a bouquet of pink peonies delivered to her.\n\nWatch the sweet moment below:\n\nWhile Timberlake did refuse to confirm any rumors about special guests at his Super Bowl performance, he also invited DeGeneres to join him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come out with me if you want,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re very good at dancing too.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres declined the offer, but did ask him to send her a secret sign during the performance.\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a lot going on but during the performance, could you give some kind of signal so I know you\u2019re thinking of me? Like a dance move and a rubbing of the stomach\u2026 ?\u201d\n\nLOL!\n\nHe agreed, saying, \u201cWell, you are my other girl. Although that feels creepy doesn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nAw, Justin, we sure do love your sense of humor!\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nAlthough seriously amazing, Timberlake wasn\u2019t even the only musical treat DeGeneres received for her birthday. Guest Kristen Bell gave the birthday girl a shirt with the saying \u201cIt took 60 years to look this good.\u201d\n\nBell then introduced her husband, Dax Shepard, who apparently wrote an original song about how DeGeneres made 60 look \u201cso sexy\u201d. The actor, all dressed up in a white tuxedo, sang: \u201cYou make 60 look so sexy. I know Portia\u2019s your girl, but if you were single and straight I\u2019d rock your world.\u201d\n\nOther lyrics included, \u201cIf I could be with you, I\u2019d be the luckiest guy then you could hook me up with a check from Shutterfly\u201d and \u201cYou get better with time, like a really fine wine and did I mention all your money?\u201d\n\nWe do have to point out that the voice doing the singing sounds an awful lot like John Legend, but we\u2019ll say it\u2019s totally Shepard because that makes it all the more hilarious.\n\nHappy Birthday, Ellen!", "images": ["https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AdobeStock_92377390-e1562949347795-150x150.jpeg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ic_scripps.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=621503737999996&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ellenjustin.jpg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/simplemost_logo550.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-_RZ5Sz8Yt-BUw.gif", "https://trc.taboola.com/1147555/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rip-Torn-Getty-1-2019-150x150.jpg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mit-150x150.png", "https://trc.taboola.com/1138740/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/simplemost_logo-s.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0c48e7600a420484dfbe2e6aa38131dc?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lm-1-e1562781844210-150x150.jpg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/bf0305f2-f88d-4d73-9c62-ef95c117c883-1-150x150.jpg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-452441638-e1562866603623-150x150.jpg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1045629912_meghan-markle-e1562012329568-150x150.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036471&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ellenjustin.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlin Gates"], "canonical_link": "https://www.simplemost.com/watch-justin-timberlake-surprise-ellen-degeneres-epic-birthday-gift/", "title": "Justin Timberlake's Birthday Surprise For Ellen", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "ellen degeneres, justin timberlake, the ellen degeneres show", "original-source": "https://www.simplemost.com/watch-justin-timberlake-surprise-ellen-degeneres-epic-birthday-gift/", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Justin Timberlake Surprise Ellen DeGeneres On Her Birthday", "description": "Anyone who has seen \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d knows DeGeneres love surprises\u2014and Justin Timberlake.
