The 36-year-old Honest Company CEO visited The Tonight Show on Wednesday where she opened up to host Jimmy Fallon about picking out a name for her third child.\n\nNoting that her children all have \u201cH\u201d names that are also words, Alba said, \u201cWe\u2019re super stoked. It\u2019s going to be a whole situation. [Cash] was like, \u2018We should name it Dick with a silent \u2018h.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut the former actress wasn\u2019t keen on the idea, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just awful. He thinks it\u2019s old school. I\u2019m like, \u2018No, it\u2019s not.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Fallon tried to reason with Warren\u2019s logic, saying, \u201cIt could be like an old timey detective,\u201d she jokingly replied, \u201cDon\u2019t encourage him.\u201d\n\nMORE: Jessica Alba Reveals Gender of Her Third Baby in Adorable Video -- See What She's Having\n\nAlba also opened up about her pregnancy cravings this time around, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was craving anything, until I realized I\u2019m craving Japanese food all the time. I actually dream about desserts, but I\u2019m trying not to gain too much weight with this baby, so I just dream about them. I want all the shaved ice with ice cream on the bottom.\u201d\n\nFallon decided to treat Alba to a taste of his top secret new Ben & Jerrys flavor, which doesn\u2019t come out until November.\n\nAfter she had a bite of the mystery ice cream, she declared, \u201cOh, it\u2019s really good. That\u2019s really dangerous. It\u2019s like Heaven.\u201d\n\nFor more from Alba, watch the clip below!\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jessica_alba_gettyimages_866403280.jpg?itok=PVzvzoD2", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1154906971.jpg?itok=sZoGPV7c&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-10/jessica_alba_gettyimages_866403280.jpg?itok=0jEODdOr&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-11/gettyimages-1063551938.jpg?itok=o7SIblB-&h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-06/gettyimages-958745538.jpg?itok=wlJ28kMj&h=87c7c3fc"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jessica_alba_gettyimages_866403280.jpg?itok=PVzvzoD2", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jessica-alba-says-hubby-cash-warren-wants-name-their-son-dick-silent-h-talks-pregnancy-cravings", "title": "Jessica Alba Says Hubby Cash Warren Wants to Name Their Son \u2018Dick With a Silent H,\u2019 Talks Pregnancy Cravings", "meta_data": {"title": "Jessica Alba Says Hubby Cash Warren Wants to Name Their Son \u2018Dick With a Silent H,\u2019 Talks Pregnancy Cravings | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jessica-alba-says-hubby-cash-warren-wants-name-their-son-dick-silent-h-talks-pregnancy-cravings", "title": "Jessica Alba Says Hubby Cash Warren Wants to Name Their Son \u2018Dick With a Silent H,\u2019 Talks Pregnancy Cravings", "description": "She visited \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 on Wednesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jessica_alba_gettyimages_866403280.jpg?itok=PVzvzoD2", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "She visited \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 on Wednesday.", "title": "Jessica Alba Says Hubby Cash Warren Wants to Name Their Son \u2018Dick With a Silent H,\u2019 Talks Pregnancy Cravings", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Rachel McRady\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jessica-alba-says-hubby-cash-warren-wants-name-their-son-dick-silent-h-talks-pregnancy-cravings", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jessica_alba_gettyimages_866403280.jpg?itok=PVzvzoD2"}, "description": "She visited \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 on Wednesday.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, TV, Jessica Alba, Pregnancies, Babies & Kids, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, TV, Jessica Alba, Pregnancies, Babies & Kids, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
