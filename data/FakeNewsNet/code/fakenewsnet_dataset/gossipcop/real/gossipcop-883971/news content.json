Well, they eventually decided to move forward with their divorce, Page Six reported in January.\n\nGolnesa gave an update on the status of her divorce from Shalom during a recent interview with ET. \u201cI think ideally, I have another two months, three months until the divorce is finalized,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s kind of where we are.\u201d\n\nThe two only communicate through lawyers now, and Golnesa said that she is \"100 percent\" certain that she will never get back together with Shalom. \u201cI made it very clear from the beginning, as I do every relationship, I'm not the one to fall in love,\u201d she told ET. \u201cI'm not the type to do these things. Don't expect me to coddle you or do these things, and he kept thinking he would change me, and he couldn't \u2026 You cannot tame the beast.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Golnesa said that Shalom is still close with one member of the Shahs squad \u2014 and she's not exactly happy about it, as we'll see in the upcoming season. \u201cMike [Shouhed] established a very, very close relationship with Shalom,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, it didn't stop, even when he was, you know, out to do negative things to me, Mike wasn't stopping being friends with him. So, people will see a little bit of that.\u201d\n\nNow Golnesa said that when it comes to dating, she really just wants someone to make a baby with. \u201cI'm looking for some very healthy sperm,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI mean, I'm looking for, ideally, a man who would like to be a parent and not be in a relationship with me. Because I know myself, and I can't be in a relationship with a person. So, a guy who's ready to be a dad, be involved and have that, just the way I am.\u201d\n\nCould new Shah Nema Vand be a candidate for Golnesa's baby daddy? We'll find out when Season 7 of Shahs of Sunset premieres Thursday, August 2 at 9/8c. But this sneak peek definitely has us wondering...", "images":
