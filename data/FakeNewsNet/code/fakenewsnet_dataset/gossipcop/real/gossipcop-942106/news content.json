So it's no surprise that he's also good at hosting late night television and slaying James Corden in a cover battle contest.\n\nShawn has been hanging out with James on The Late Late Show this past week; call it a takeover, call it guest-hosting, call it whatever you want \u2014 but we\u2019re calling it our new favorite TV show. The latest shenanigans Shawn and James got into was a cover battle, where they competed in a subway station (AKA a set dressed up to look like they were singing in the subway) to see who could do the most epic cover. Shawn took on Oasis\u2019s \u201cWonderwall,\u201d while James whipped out a literal piano and sparkly jacket to do \u201cGreat Balls of Fire,\u201d which definitely raised the stakes for Shawn.\n\nNot to be outdone, Shawn transformed himself into \u201cDJ Stitches,\u201d a nod to his first big hit, and blasted \u201cWe Found Love\u201d by Rihanna, complete with a light machine and sunglasses. James then masqueraded as all five Backstreet Boys by wearing puppets in white suits to perform \u201cEverybody.\u201d Their turf war finally ended when Shawn came down from the ceiling in a literal angel outfit to sing his own song, \u201cThere's Nothing Holdin' Me Back,\u201d alongside a gospel choir. You don\u2019t see that in a subway station every day, do you? In our opinion, DJ Stitches definitely won the cover battle.\n\nShawn and James shared more of their favorite music in an episode of Carpool Karaoke recently too. They sang some of Shawn\u2019s biggest hits, like \u201cTreat You Better\u201d and \u201cMercy,\u201d and Shawn even dressed up like Harry Potter to discuss his super-fandom of the book series. This week-long takeover of the Late Late Show has us thinking that Shawn could definitely have a career as a talk show host.\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.\n\nWant more from Teen Vogue?
