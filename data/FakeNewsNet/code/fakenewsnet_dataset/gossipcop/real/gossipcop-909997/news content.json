Outraged fans called out the injustice on Twitter. \"We champion women one award weekend & pull this shit the next,\" wrote Modern Family's Jesse Tyler Ferguson.\n\nWe champion women one award weekend & then pull this shit the next. @lorde should be singing from her genius album. #2stepsforward3stepsback https://t.co/UTGjOV2eQK \u2014 Jesse Tyler Ferguson (@jessetyler) January 29, 2018\n\n[Editor's Note: speaking after the broadcast Billboard Recording Academy President Neil Portnow and Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich explained the awkward situation. \"These shows are always a matter of choices, and we know we have a box and the box gets full and filled up,\u201d Ehrlich told reporters. \u201cShe had a great album, album of the year is a big honor, but there's no way we can really deal with everybody. Sometimes people get left out that shouldn't, but on the other hand, we did the best we can to make sure that it's a representative and balanced show.\"\n\nEarlier, Lorde reportedly declined an offer to perform as part of a of a group tribute to Tom Petty involving his song \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d though she did take the stage Friday night to cover Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cSilver Springs\u201d at the pre-Grammys MusiCares Person of the Year.]\n\nBut while Lorde didn't take the stage to share her message during the Grammys broadcast, the singer-songwriter still managed to make her voice heard once inside Madison Square Garden (she noticeably skipped the red carpet), affixing a poem by conceptual artist Jenny Holzer to the back of her fluffy tulle Valentino gown.\n\n\"My version of a white rose \u2014 THE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM \u2014 an excerpt from the greatest of all time, jenny holzer,\" wrote Lorde on Instagram, referencing the white roses worn by a handful of men and women on the carpet to show solidarity with the Time's Up movement. \"The old & correct must be laid to waste,\" reads the excerpt. \"Before the just can triumph. Contradiction will be heightened. The reckoning will be hastened by the staging of seed disturbances. The apocalypse will blossom.\"\n\nBut Lorde didn't let the controversy dampen her mood. Once inside the venue, she pulled a Rihanna, reaching for a flask that just happened to perfectly match the vibrant red hue of her gown. Because sometimes a little booze is needed to take the edge off the patriarchy.\n\nLorde's mother, the NZ poet Sonja Yelich, shared her thoughts on her daughter\u2019s apparent snub with a Twitter post, highlighting a New York Times article which addressed gender inequality among Grammy winners.\n\nthis says it all -@nytimes January 26, 2018 pic.twitter.com/R3YdHwieXf \u2014 Sonja Yelich (@sonjayelich1) January 26, 2018\n\nOf her nomination, Lorde told Billboard this month, \"It\u2019s crazy I\u2019m the only woman in my category, and I feel very proud of that. I\u2019m wearing that mantle for sure. But I\u2019m also stoked that I\u2019m in there with four incredible artists of color \u2014 it\u2019s a big moment for the Grammys. It\u2019s exciting when these institutions move in the right way. To me, that is a huge victory.\"\n\nRead the full excerpt from the poem below:\n\nRejoice! Our times are intolerable. Take courage, for the worst is a harbinger of the best. Only dire circumstance can precipitate the overthrow of oppressors. The old & correct must be laid to waste. Before the just can triumph. Contradiction will be heightened. The reckoning will be hastened by the staging of seed disturbances. The apocalypse will blossom.\n\nThis article originally appeared on THR.com.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/media/lorde-grammys-red-show-audience-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/lorde-grammys-red-show-audience-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/lorde-grammys-red-show-audience-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lorde-accessorizes-grammys-gown-poem-flask-1079524", "title": "Lorde Accessorized Her Grammys Gown with Feminist Poem & Flask", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Lorde Accessorized Her Grammys Gown with Feminist Poem & Flask", "description": "Lorde didn't perform, but she made a loud noise with Jenny Holzer's powerful poem sewn into her gown.", "og": {"title": "Lorde Accessorized Her Grammys Gown with Feminist Poem & Flask", "description": "Lorde didn't perform, but she made a loud noise with Jenny Holzer's powerful poem sewn into her gown.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/lorde-grammys-red-show-audience-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lorde-accessorizes-grammys-gown-poem-flask-1079524", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lorde-accessorizes-grammys-gown-poem-flask-1079524", "title": "Lorde Accessorized Her Grammys Gown with Feminist Poem & Flask", "description": "Lorde didn't perform, but she made a loud noise with Jenny Holzer's powerful poem sewn into her gown.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/lorde-grammys-red-show-audience-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
