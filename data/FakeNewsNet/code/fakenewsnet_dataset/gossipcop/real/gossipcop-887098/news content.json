In a statement, board members say they're sending a message that \"sexually predatory behavior ... in our industry is over.\" USA TODAY\n\nFILE - In this Nov. 23, 2011 file photo, producer Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of The Weinstein Company, appears during an interview in New York. Weinstein faces multiple allegations of sexual abuse and harassment from some of the biggest names in Hollywood. (AP Photo/John Carucci, File) ORG XMIT: NYET267 (Photo: John Carucci, AP)\n\nHarvey Weinstein, the embattled producer accused by some of Hollywood's leading actresses of sexual assault, was expelled Saturday by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences board.\n\nThe board reviewed Weinstein\u2019s membership during an emergency meeting and released a statement Saturday afternoon saying it \"voted well in excess of the required two-thirds majority to immediately expel him from the Academy.\"\n\nThe statement from the Academy said, \"We do so not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over. What\u2019s at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society. The Board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.\"\n\nA couple of famous members of the Academy tweeted in support of the board's decision.\n\nActress Mia Farrow, whose son Ronan recently published a New Yorker investigation with rape and sexual assault allegations against Weinstein's, wrote that she's proud of the Academy, and \"hopefully we are witnessing the end of an awful era.\"\n\nActor Ron Perlman also said he's \"proud of their decision to expel Harvey Weinstein.\"\n\nActress Marlee Matlin tweeted, \"Bravo\" to the Academy for \"highlighting willful ignorance and complicity.\u201d\n\nWeinstein becomes the second person ever to be kicked out of the Academy, after Godfather actor Carmine Caridi, who was removed in 2004 for illegally sharing Oscar screeners. Meanwhile, several Hollywood figures known for alleged sexual misconduct, including Roman Polanski and Bill Cosby, remain members.\n\nOver his career, Weinstein has cobbled together 341 Oscar nominations and 81 wins. His films include The King's Speech, The Artist and Shakespeare in Love, all of which won best picture.\n\nEarlier: Bob Weinstein speaks out\n\nFallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues more than a week after an explosive New York Times investigation detailed decades of sexual harassment accusations against Weinstein. The Weinstein Company, which he helped to found has fired him, and Weinstein's wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Saturday, Weinstein's brother Bob said he's living in \"a waking nightmare.\"\n\nBob Weinstein, co-founder of The Weinstein Company, said he knew that his brother was a philandering bully, but had no idea \"the type of predator\" his brother is accused of being. \"I want him to get the justice he deserves,\" Bob Weinstein said.\n\nMore: A timeline of Harvey Weinstein\n\nCLOSE Some 30 women spoke out this week to say Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or sexually assaulted them. A People magazine deputy editor talks about the case and how it's affecting Hollywood.
