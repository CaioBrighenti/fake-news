While the tabloids have been on bump watch since the couple announced their engagement, no-one really believed that Meghan would embark on a 16-day marathon tour with 76 engagements while pregnant. Even the UK royal watchers weren\u2019t in on this secret, which is saying something.\n\n\u201cOf course \u2018pregnant women works\u2019, is not the stuff of headlines, this is 2018 after all. But the royal couple weren\u2019t just touring Australia and New Zealand; Fiji and Tonga were an important part of the itinerary, nations beloved by Her Majesty who were aching for a royal visit, especially one from the House of Windsor\u2019s new super couple.\u201d", "images": ["https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2019-07-12.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/285x190/1037321_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/285x190/1037351_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1037467.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1037467.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kat Clementine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1037467/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-royal-news-new-zealand", "title": "Meghan's royal tour SUCCESS: How Duchess won over royal fans on her first tour", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "MEGHAN Markle has won over Royal fans during her whirlwind first tour packed full of \u201csurprises at every turn\u201d, according to an Australian royal expert.\nWith 76 engagements starting kicking off with the \u201cblind-siding\u201d announcement of the Duchess\u2019 pregnancy, this had been a Royal tour like no other.", "fb": {"pages": 129617873765147, "app_id": 823607694325129}, "og": {"title": "Meghan's royal tour SUCCESS: How Duchess won over royal fans on her first tour", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1037467/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-royal-news-new-zealand", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1037467.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "ctp_video,autoplay_video,Meghan Markle,Prince Harry,Australian tour", "section": "Royal", "description": "MEGHAN Markle has won over Royal fans during her whirlwind first tour packed full of \u201csurprises at every turn\u201d, according to an Australian royal expert.\nWith 76 engagements starting kicking off with the \u201cblind-siding\u201d announcement of the Duchess\u2019 pregnancy, this had been a Royal tour like no other."}, "news_keywords": "ctp_video,autoplay_video,Meghan Markle,Prince Harry,Australian tour", "article": {"tag": "Australian tour", "published_time": "2018-10-28T13:16:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-28T15:14:28+00:00", "expiration_time": "2018-11-27", "section": "Royal", "image_count": 5, "video_count": 2, "word_count": 757, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "author": "Kat Clementine", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1037467.jpg"}, "title": "Meghan's royal tour SUCCESS: How Duchess won over royal fans on her first tour", "description": "MEGHAN Markle has won over Royal fans during her whirlwind first tour packed full of \u201csurprises at every turn\u201d, according to an Australian royal expert.\nWith 76 engagements starting kicking off with the \u201cblind-siding\u201d announcement of the Duchess\u2019 pregnancy, this had been a Royal tour like no other."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Meghan's royal tour SUCCESS: How Duchess won over royal fans on her first tour", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir,all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1540732560.0, "source": "https://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
