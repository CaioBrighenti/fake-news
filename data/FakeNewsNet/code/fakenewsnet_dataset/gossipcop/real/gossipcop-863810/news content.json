HBO \"The Americans\" ended in May with an incredible finale that was the perfect end to one of the best TV series of all time. But not every series finale is as brilliant.\n\nA few of the best shows in TV history ended terribly, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"Girls.\" The worst series finales ignore the show's themes, or abandon some of its main characters to tell a detached story.\n\nIt's a daunting task to wrap up a series in just one episode, comedy or drama.
