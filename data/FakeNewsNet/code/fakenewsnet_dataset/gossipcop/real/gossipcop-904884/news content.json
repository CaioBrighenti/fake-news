But this year, many female celebrities are eschewing the typical brightly colored dresses and statement-making patterns on the red carpet for something more powerful\u2014all black.\n\nThe call to wear black comes from the ambitious Time\u2019s Up initiative, created by 300 actresses and female agents, writers, directors, and executives, including such power players as Eva Longoria , Shonda Rimes , and Reese Witherspoon . The goal of Time\u2019s Up is to combat inequality, sexual harassment, and sexual assault in the workplace; the movement already has a $14 million legal defense fund. Time\u2019s Up is a direct response to the #MeToo movement that has upended industries from politics to Hollywood to restaurants to journalism by exposing sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace\u2014and actually, miraculously, holding abusers accountable.\n\nThe all-black fashion statement could be classified as a silent protest, but the purpose is loud and clear: It\u2019s a powerful show of support for the many people who are speaking out against their powerful abusers. Longoria told The New York Times , \u201cThis is a moment of solidarity, not a fashion moment. For years, we\u2019ve sold these awards shows as women, with our gowns and colors and our beautiful faces and our glamour. This time the industry can\u2019t expect us to go up and twirl around. That\u2019s not what this moment is about.\u201d\n\nSee below for a growing list of the actresses who participated in the red carpet blackout at the Golden Globes.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5cf142bba0d8ce016afd0422/4:3/h_130/follain.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5cf564a2fa13d754cbd73186/4:3/h_130/redness.gif", "https://collector-PX69t0oUvr.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX69t0oUvr", "https://media.self.com/photos/5cf7ba612c4b76fb81fd5a6b/4:3/h_130/atheltic-shades.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a52c8923c2b2615013efc21/4:3/w_728/GettyImages-902351540.jpg", "https://www.self.com/images/self-starter-failsafe.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a52ba372937024202bdf217/2:1/pass/GettyImages-902337026.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5a52ba372937024202bdf217/2:1/pass/GettyImages-902337026.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Cruel", "January"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/gallery/celebrities-wearing-black-golden-globes", "title": "Golden Globes 2018: Black Dresses, Time\u2019s Up, and Fashion as Activism", "meta_data": {"generator": "autopilot-build-Sat Jul 13 2019 18:10:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "Jessica Cruel", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond&#233; Nast 2019", "description": "As part of the Time's Up campaign to combat sexual harassment, sexual assault, and gender inequality at work, celebrities will wear black to the Golden Globes.", "keywords": "golden globes,2018 golden globes,eva longoria,shonda rhimes,reese witherspoon,#metoo,time's up,sexual assault,sexual harassment", "news_keywords": "Beauty,Fashion,golden globes,2018 golden globes,eva longoria,shonda rhimes,reese witherspoon,#metoo,time's up,sexual assault,sexual harassment", "og": {"description": "Time's up.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5a52ba372937024202bdf217/2:1/pass/GettyImages-902337026.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "What You Should Know About the Black Dresses at the Golden Globes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/gallery/celebrities-wearing-black-golden-globes"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "Time's up.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.self.com/photos/5a52ba372937024202bdf217/2:1/pass/GettyImages-902337026.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "SELFmagazine", "title": "What You Should Know About the Black Dresses at the Golden Globes"}, "fb": {"pages": 8908243810, "admins": "1515690174,835972574,1301604672,505160,43600163"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
