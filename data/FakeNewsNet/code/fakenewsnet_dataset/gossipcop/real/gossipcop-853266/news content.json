{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Middleton", "text": "Philippa Charlotte Middleton (born 6 September 1983)[4][5] is an English socialite, author, and columnist. The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, she began receiving media attention with her appearance as the maid of honour at her sister's wedding to Prince William.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nPippa Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire, England. She is the second of three children born to Michael Middleton (born 1949), a former British Airways flight dispatcher, and Carole Middleton (n\u00e9e Goldsmith; born 1955), a former flight attendant.[6][7] She was christened at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire.[8]\n\nEducation [ edit ]\n\nIn 1995, her family moved to Bucklebury, Berkshire.[9][10] Like her sister, Middleton was first educated at St Andrew's School, a private boarding school in Pangbourne and then Downe House School, a girls' day and boarding school in Cold Ash. She was a boarder at Marlborough College, where she held a sports/all-rounder scholarship.[11][12] Middleton then graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an English literature degree,[13] where she shared a house with Lord Edward Innes-Ker, a son of the Duke of Roxburghe, and with Earl Percy, heir apparent of the Duke of Northumberland.[13]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nFollowing her graduation, Middleton briefly worked in 2008 at a public relations firm promoting luxury products. She then had an events management job with Table Talk, a company based in London that organises corporate events and parties.[11][14] Also in 2008, Tatler magazine named Middleton \"the Number 1 Society Singleton\", ahead of singer-songwriter James Blunt and Princess Eugenie of York,[15] although in the same Tatler article she was described as someone who \"goes to a lot of parties, but mainly as the caterer.\" Since then, she has often been described as a socialite.[16] As part of a duo with her elder sister, Middleton has received wide press coverage, focusing on her social life and her lifestyle. In April 2012, Time magazine listed Middleton as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[17]\n\nMiddleton has worked part-time for her parents' company Party Pieces, editing the web magazine Party Times.[11][18]\n\nPenguin Books paid Middleton a \u00a3400,000 advance for a book on party planning. The book, entitled Celebrate, was published in autumn 2012, and had lower than anticipated sales as many reviewers mocked it for the obviousness of its content.[19][20] In March 2013, Middleton parted from her literary agent.[21]\n\nThe 2016 ITV documentary, Our Queen At 90, revealed that a recipe which featured in Middleton's Celebrate book \u2013 Granny's Marrow Chutney \u2013 had been made by her sister, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who gave a jar of it as a Christmas gift to her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2011.[22]\n\nMiddleton is also a regular columnist for several publications. She has contributed articles to The Spectator magazine since December 2012[23] and began having a food column in the supermarket magazine Waitrose Kitchen beginning in spring 2013.[24] In June 2013 she was named a contributing editor of Vanity Fair writing a series of columns for the magazine.[25] Beginning in September 2013, Middleton also wrote a fortnightly sports and social column for The Sunday Telegraph.[26] She parted ways from The Telegraph in May 2014.\n\nIn May 2013, she became the sole director and shareholder of PXM Enterprises Limited.[27] The company is headquartered at 19 Portland Place in London.[27]\n\nIn September 2016, Middleton's iPhone was hacked. The Sun reported it had been approached by a hacker who claimed to have 3,000 images from Middleton's iCloud account and demanded \u00a350,000 for them. The hacker was arrested that same month.[28]\n\nRoyal wedding [ edit ]\n\nMiddleton stands with the Royal Family as maid of honour at the wedding of her sister and Prince William, as Prince Philip looks on\n\nThe official announcement of her sister's engagement came on 16 November 2010. Middleton served as the maid of honour.[29] At the wedding, Middleton's white figure-hugging dress, which, like the bride's, was created by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen, was highly praised in the media. Made of ivory cr\u00eape fabric, it was styled with a cowl at the front and organza-covered buttons at the back. Copies of the dress were soon available on the High Street[30][31] where there was a great demand for them.[32][33][34]\n\nPhilanthropy [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2013, Middleton became an ambassador to the Mary Hare School for deaf children in Berkshire.\n\nIn June 2014, Middleton became an ambassador to the British Heart Foundation (BHF).[35] That month, she took part in the Race Across America, a 3,000 mile cycling race across the United States, followed by the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Swimming Race, a 6.5 km swimming competition in Istanbul, as two fundraising opportunities for the BHF.[35] Her bicycle was also auctioned on eBay for the BHF.[35] She then attended the BHF's Roll out the Red Ball at the Park Lane Hotel on 10 February 2015.[36] She auctioned one of her L.K.Bennett dresses at the ball. She took part in the London to Brighton Bike Ride for the BHF on 21 June 2015. In September 2015, Middleton participated in a 47-mile swim-run competition in Sweden alongside her brother and James Matthews to raise money for the Michael Matthews Foundation, a charity found in honour of James Matthew's brother who lost his life on a mountain climbing trek.[37]\n\nIn September 2016, Middleton released her second book, Heartfelt, whose proceeds go to the British Heart Foundation.[38]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2016, Middleton became engaged to James Matthews, a former professional racing driver, now hedge fund manager. The couple married on 20 May 2017 at St Mark's Church, at Englefield Estate, Berkshire, near Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family home.[39] Her niece and nephew Princess Charlotte and Prince George of Cambridge were amongst the bride's attendants.\n\nMatthews became a City of London trader in 1995 and in 2001 was co-founder of Eden Rock Capital Management (named after his father's Eden Rock hotel in St Barts), of which he is now Chief Executive. His father is Laird of Glen Affric, a 10,000 acre estate in Scotland. If Matthews inherits the lairdship, then Middleton may be accorded the courtesy title of Lady Glen Affric.[40][41][42][43]\n\nIn June 2018, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child.[44][45][46] Their son was born on 15 October 2018 at St Mary's Hospital, London.[47][48][49]\n\nArms [ edit ]\n\nCoat of arms of Pippa Middleton Notes Middleton bears her father's arms on a lozenge.
