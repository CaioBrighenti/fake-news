William was reportedly not happy when Harry was given the role of youth ambassador for the Commonwealth.\n\nFrom being young boys united in grief to building Britain\u2019s modern monarchy together, the brothers could not have been closer \u2014 until now.\n\nRoyal insiders still blame Meghan, claiming the problems between the two date back to when the former Suits actress, 37, appeared on the scene.\n\nMeghan reportedly felt rejected by Kate when she tried to befriend her sister-in-law and Harry\u2019s overprotectiveness of his wife \u2014 and refusal to see reason \u2014 is the main cause of the chasm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my opinion that Harry feels he couldn\u2019t protect his mother, so he\u2019s going all out to protect his wife. This is his way of atoning,\u201d a source told The Sun.\n\n\u201cHe will brook absolutely no criticism of Meghan \u2014 and he is so sensitive he often sees criticism or negativity where there isn\u2019t any.\u201d\n\nOf course, like any family, the brothers have locked horns before.\n\nWilliam, 36, was said to be furious with Harry, 34, for getting caught on camera stripping in a Las Vegas hotel room six years ago.\n\nAnd their teasing about everything from who\u2019s the most bald to the better soldier has always been rife.\n\nBut they always turned to each other when times were tough.\n\nThe first hint of friction came after William was introduced to Meghan, 37, when she was staying at Kensington Palace.\n\nOnce she\u2019d returned home to Canada, William reportedly sat Harry down for a chat, meant as brotherly advice.\n\nHe knew Harry was already head-over-heels for the US actress but wanted him to take it slowly.\n\n\u201cWilliam told his brother they knew nothing about her background, her intentions, what she was really like,\u201d a source said.\n\n\u201cHe just wanted to stress that becoming part of the Royal Family is a massive undertaking and the pressure and scrutiny is unrelenting. Was Meghan the right one?\u201d\n\nThe chat apparently did not go down well.\n\n\u201cHarry went mental,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cHe accused his brother of trying to finish his romance before it had begun. The brothers\u2019 relationship has not really recovered.\u201d\n\nThe Sun understands other senior members of the family also \u201chad concerns\u201d and voiced them to Harry.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in the family objected. Who really knows what the concerns were? Was it Meghan\u2019s background? Her father and dreadful half-sister? Because she was an outspoken American? Divorced?\u201d another source told the publication.\n\n\u201cHarry stood up for Meghan very forcibly. He really loves her.\u201d\n\nMeghan also faced some opposition from the Middleton family, who didn\u2019t want to invite her to Pippa\u2019s wedding last May. They feared Meghan\u2019s first public appearance with Prince Harry would overshadow the bride\u2019s big day.\n\nEventually she was asked but chose only to go to the evening celebration.\n\nSo it was no surprise that when she moved to London last November \u2014 and her engagement to Harry was announced \u2014 she was desperate to make things work.\n\nShe hoped that in Kate, another \u201coutsider\u201d who had navigated the choppy waters with aplomb, she would find a natural best friend.\n\nBut Kate, 36, was recovering from terrible morning sickness in her pregnancy with Prince Louis and was busy with George, 5, and Charlotte, 3.\n\n\u201cMeghan hoped Kate would show her the ropes. But, equally understandably, Kate was busy. She didn\u2019t have as much time for her as Meghan would have liked. They were at very different places in their lives,\u201d a source explained.\n\n\u201cMeghan felt quite let down. She had really tried but felt rebuffed, and so just stopped trying.\u201d\n\nHarry did not take this lightly and spoke to William about making Meghan feel welcome.\n\nIn February, the two couples appeared on stage together for the first time to talk about their Royal Foundation charitable work, where host Tina Daheley asked them if working together as a family caused any \u201cdisagreements\u201d.\n\nMeghan looked down, Kate fiddled with her hair and they left it to William, who answered with a very direct: \u201cOh yes.\u201d\n\nHarry then joked that there are so many clashes that \u201cthey come so thick and fast.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if they\u2019d been \u201cresolved\u201d, William jokingly replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nAnother point of contention between the two couples is Meghan\u2019s father Thomas Markle.\n\nMr Markle pulled out of walking his daughter down the aisle after it was revealed he had posed for paparazzi pictures. Calm but collected, Meghan decided her team should say nothing publicly and cut him off.\n\nHowever, William \u2014 having lost his mum \u2014 couldn\u2019t understand ignoring a parent, whatever they\u2019d done. He thought Meghan was making a mistake.\n\nMeghan is said to be far less intimidated by the royals than might be supposed. At a recent gathering of senior family members, including Meghan, one well-placed aide remarked: \u201cAll their IQs put together would not equal hers,\u201d according to The Sun.\n\nShe and Harry have started spending less time at Kensington Palace after taking possession of a Cotswold farmhouse in the spring.\n\nThe bolthole is used to entertain friends like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, Serena Williams, and George and Amal Clooney.\n\nWilliam and Kate also swerved a board meeting of the Royal Foundation this week, leaving Harry and Meghan to go alone.\n\nThey also missed the Christmas Party, with one insider saying: \u201cit \u2018was a shame\u2019 they didn\u2019t attend.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only were Harry and Meghan there, but they went to the staff Christmas party afterwards.\n\n\u201cIt was a very jolly affair. It\u2019s a shame that William and Catherine did not turn up.\u201d\n\nNext year the brothers are splitting their household, with staff choosing which prince to work for.\n\nThis article originally
