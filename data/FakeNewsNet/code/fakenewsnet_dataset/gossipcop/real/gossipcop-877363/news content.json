Most recently, he\u2019s helped his father overcome one of his biggest fears: flying.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t flown in 10 years. In 10 years!\u201d the 41-year-old producer said in a recent Instagram of himself on a jet with the 10-month-old perched on his lap. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I had was fear of flying. Asahd made me overcome my fear of flying.\u201d\n\nHe then turned to the little boy and said, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nKhaled and his longtime love, Nicole Tuck, welcomed their son in October 2016. Naturally, Khaled documented the entire process on his favorite app, Snapchat.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

He has great energy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the glow of a young mogul \u2014 the glow of a young icon. He\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nTwins!
