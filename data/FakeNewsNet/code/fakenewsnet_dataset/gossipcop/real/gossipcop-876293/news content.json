Taylor Swift may have just revealed who is still in her squad. In the singer\u2019s latest music video, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the star wears a T-shirt that features the names of several of her famous pals.\n\nIn the video, which MTV debuted during the Video Music Awards on Sunday, August 27, Swift, 26, recreated the \u201cJunior Jewels\u201d top that she wore during her 2008 \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d music video.\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s Red Carpet Style Evolution\n\nSo, who made the cut? BFF Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid and Lena Dunham\u2019s names were given prominent spots in the front. Other names written in marker included Ed Sheeran, Patrick Stewart, Abigail Anderson, Martha Hunt, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds (Blake & Ryan), Todrick Hall, Claire Kislinger and Haim sisters Este, Alana and Danielle.\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s Celebrity BFFs!\n\nFans were quick to notice who appeared to be left out \u2014 Karlie Kloss, Lorde, Ruby Rose and Hailee Steinfeld. In June, Lorde apologized for comparing her friendship with Swift to an \u201cautoimmune disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a friend with very specific allergies. There are certain places you can\u2019t go together. Certain things you can\u2019t do. There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship,\u201d Lorde told The Guardian. She later tweeted: \u201cDidn\u2019t mention taylor, but regardless, i f\u2013ked up & that was really insensitive.\u201d\n\n\n\nCelebrity BFFs\n\nSteinfeld, meanwhile, revealed in August 2016 that she wasn\u2019t very close with Swift, despite being featured in her \u201cBad Blood\u201d music video.\n\n\u201cI think people think we spend a lot more time together than we actually do!\u201d the Pitch Perfect 2 actress told Seventeen magazine at the time. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing though.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
