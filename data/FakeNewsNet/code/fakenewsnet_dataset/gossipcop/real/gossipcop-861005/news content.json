Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production. As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.\u201d\n\nThe statement officially confirms Olympios as the contestant in question, following a wildfire of unconfirmed tabloid reports that allege she was reportedly heavily under the influence of alcohol and involved in a sexual situation with a male co-star (which Variety has opted not to name, until he speaks out), while \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d cameras were rolling. Since the production shut down, the tabloid press has played out as a he-said-she-said saga with numerous conflicting reports over the past 48 hours.\n\nThis past Sunday, Warner Bros. Television, which produces \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d for ABC, announced production had been shut down due to \u201callegations of misconduct,\u201d though the studio did not offer any further details on the matter. A formal investigation, led by Warner Bros. TV, is currently underway. ABC has declined to comment on the future of the series, which Variety reported Tuesday is nearing an official cancellation.\n\nAs for Olympios\u2019 lawyer, Singer of Lavely & Singer is a pit bull attorney who is known for sending ferocious legal threats and representing many troubled A-listers. He reps Charlie Sheen, and his clients have included Arnold Schwarzenegger, Quentin Tarantino, Bryan Singer, Sharon Stone, and John Travolta. He represented Bill Cosby for years until late 2015 during his ongoing sex-abuse lawsuit. This is not Singer\u2019s first battle with Warner Bros. TV \u2014 back in 2011, he sued the studio for $100 million on behalf of his client Sheen when he was fired from \u201cTwo and a Half Men.\u201d\n\nVariety has learned Olympios has previously been represented by Melanie Cook, a partner at the entertainment firm Ziffren Brittenham, which specializes in transactional law, rather than litigation like Singer. Ziffren confirmed that they still represent Olympios, likely just for contract work, but the company declined to elaborate further on the matter. An insider says Cook referred her client, Olympios, to Singer in light of the recent events.\n\nOlympios is beefing up her team big time \u2014 in addition to hiring Singer to take on her case, as of today, the reality star has also started working with veteran Hollywood publicist Stan Rosenfield.", "images":
