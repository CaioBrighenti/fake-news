I also asked why this information was being withheld, and why, according to standard theatre practice the issue had not been raised with me during the production via stage management, the director, my fellow actors or anyone at management level. However, no response was forthcoming,\u201d he added.\n\nA Sydney Theatre Company spokeswoman reportedly said that they had \u201creceived a complaint alleging that Mr Geoffrey Rush had engaged in inappropriate behavior\u201d after his \u201cengagement with the company had ended,\u201d but did not elaborate on the nature of the complaint.\n\nRELATED: Matt Lauer Allegedly Harassed Multiple Women, Exposed Himself: Reports\n\n\u201cThe complainant has requested that their identity be withheld,\u201d the STC spokeswoman reportedly said, adding, \u201cSTC respects that request and for privacy reasons, will not be making any further comments.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE has reached out for further comment from both the STC and Rush\u2019s representatives but has yet to receive a response.\n\nRush, 66, recently performed in a production of Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear between November 2015 and January 2016 at the STC.\n\n\u201cIt is a great disappointment to Mr Rush the STC has chosen to smear his name and unjustifiably damage his reputation in this way,\u201d a representative for Rush said in a statement.\n\nThe Australian actor is known for his recurring role as Captain Barbossa in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and is among a small group of acclaimed actors who have won an Academy Award, Primetime Emmy Award and a Tony Award.", "images":
