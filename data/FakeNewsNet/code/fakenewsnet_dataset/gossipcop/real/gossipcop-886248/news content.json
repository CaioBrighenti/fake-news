Many folks in Hollywood have come out against his alleged actions, including A-listers such as Jennifer Lawrence, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Meryl Streep, and more. However, others are willing to either hold back judgment or outright defend him. Apparently, Lindsay Lohan falls in the latter camp.\n\nIn a recent Instagram story (that was deleted almost as quickly as it was posted), Lindsay recorded herself saying, \"I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now. I don't think it's right what's going on.\" In the video, she put an angel emoji under the name Harvey, a strange choice regardless of circumstance. Notably, the video was posted shortly after news broke that Weinstein's wife, Georgina Chapman, is leaving him, which Lindsay also commented on.\n\n\"I think Georgina needs to take a stand and be there for her husband,\" she said. \"He's never harmed me or done anything wrong to me. We've done several movies together and so I think everyone needs to stop, I think it's wrong. So stand up.\"\n\nTwitter was having none of Lindsay's defense of the former studio head, who has been accused of rape by at least three women, The New Yorker reported on October 10. That same day, the New York Times reported that Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and other women alleged that Weinstein had sexually harassed them.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Weinstein has denied the sexual assault allegations, as well as any allegations of sexual harrassment.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5d02741cec86fe22b708f421/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/space-nk-new.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03c0adf1007c2917fdcdac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-baby-phat-forever-21.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d07a421ab0933024a53a537/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/selma-blair-haircut.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03ccf0f1007cddbcfdcdb0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/poli.png", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Asia Milia Ware", "Kaleigh Fasanella", "Zachary Zane", "Rosemary Donahu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/lindsay-lohan-defends-harvey-weinstein-criticizes-georgina-chapman", "title": "Lindsay Lohan Defends Harvey Weinstein, Says Georgina Chapman Should &quot;Be There for Her Husband&quot;", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Lindsey Lohan just took to Instagram to defend Harvey Weinstein in the wake of a slew of sexual harassment and assault accusations against him.", "keywords": "harvey weinstein,lindsey lohan,sexual harassment,sexual assault", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "\"I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now.\"", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Lindsay Lohan Just Criticized Harvey Weinstein's Wife for Leaving Him After Assault Allegations", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/lindsay-lohan-defends-harvey-weinstein-criticizes-georgina-chapman"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now.\"", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Lindsay Lohan Just Criticized Harvey Weinstein's Wife for Leaving Him After Assault Allegations"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
