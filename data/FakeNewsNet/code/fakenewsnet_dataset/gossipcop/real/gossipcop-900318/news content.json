Thursday, December 14, 2017, shall henceforth be known as the day that Will Smith, famous actor, father of Jaden and Willow , husband of Jada, finally made an Instagram . And he's a natural, as it turns out. Since posting the inaugural photo (a duck-face selfie, naturally) a day ago, the actor has amassed more than a million followers, gotten verified, and posted seven photos. In terms of social media savvy, Will Smith is a veritable Selena Gomez .\n\nBut along the way, Smith got some advice from a couple of famous friends. The first, Ellen DeGeneres, queen of the celebrity selfie, gave Smith a comprehensive Instagram tutorial during her show on Thursday. After the actor announced he's \"finally going on Instagram,\" DeGeneres helped him take a series of trendy portraits for the 'gram. They ran through duck-lips, a mirror selfie, a photo with a baby as a prop, a photo with vegetables as a prop, and a #TBT, all of which has since been uploaded onto Smith's Instagram. The most popular is, of course, the #TBT, a photo of Smith and DeGeneres recreating a still from the Fresh Prince of Bel-air opening credits that's gotten more than 366,000 likes.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nShortly after, Justin Timberlake became the first famous person to welcome Smith to Instagram. He posted a #TBT as well, along with some dad-friendly instructions.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\n\"Welcome to Instagram @willsmith,\" he wrote in the caption. \"This is called a #TBT. Which means Throwback Thursday. Which is a photo you post on Thursdays that you like, that was taken in the past. I like this photo because it\u2019s a photo of you and me. And we look like we are having a serious conversation about something very important. And that makes me feel important.\"\n\nSmith, however, is doing just fine on his own. He has posted his own #TBT, a vintage photo of the actor as a young baby. \"Ya\u2019ll ain\u2019t got no filters like this,\" he wrote in the caption. All hail the Fresh Prince of Instagram.", "images": ["https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f1864cc1eac746f6e754b/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Beyonce.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a804027c40d5040fb1/master/h_320,c_limit/2010.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a404027c40d5040fad/master/h_320,c_limit/1996.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2af7ea0a86c03b8be8b/master/h_320,c_limit/2017.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a404027c40d5040fac/master/h_320,c_limit/2005.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2ab4e24360ddd552de6/master/h_320,c_limit/2014.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5a33f265f46871653c88d740/2:1/w_790,c_limit/justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a17ea0a86c03b8be7d/master/h_320,c_limit/016.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2ac04027c40d5040fb3/master/h_320,c_limit/2015.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f0706802c577242df3ef1/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Michelle_Obama_Face.png", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a27ea0a86c03b8be81/master/h_320,c_limit/1999.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2ac4e24360ddd552de8/master/h_320,c_limit/2016.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5a33f265f46871653c88d740/3:2/w_640/justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f188ecc1eac746f6e754d/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Rihanna.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a604027c40d5040faf/master/h_320,c_limit/2007.jpg", "https://www.wmagazine.com/images/w_logo.svg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a87ea0a86c03b8be85/master/h_320,c_limit/2012.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a17ea0a86c03b8be7f/master/h_320,c_limit/1995.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a74e24360ddd552de4/master/h_320,c_limit/2011.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2ad04027c40d5040fb5/master/h_320,c_limit/2016*.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597dc2a67ea0a86c03b8be83/master/h_320,c_limit/2009.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5a33f265f46871653c88d740/2:1/w_790,c_limit/justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evelyn Wang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/will-smith-instagram-justin-timberlake", "title": "Will Smith Is Welcomed to Instagram by Justin Timberlake", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "author": "Evelyn Wang", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Will Smith made an Instagram account with the help of Ellen DeGeneres, and got a helpful tutorial on what a \"#TBT\" is from Justin Timberlake.", "publishDate": "2017-12-15T16:40:18Z", "keywords": "Justin Timberlake,ellen degeneres,news,will smith,snd", "fb": {"app_id": 230068530489385, "admins": 108943, "pages": 40621875003}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "title": "Will Smith Finally Joins Instagram (With Some Help From Justin Timberlake)", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/will-smith-instagram-justin-timberlake", "description": "The actor is new to #TBTs.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5a33f265f46871653c88d740/2:1/w_790,c_limit/justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "wmag", "title": "Will Smith Finally Joins Instagram (With Some Help From Justin Timberlake)", "description": "The actor is new to #TBTs.", "image": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5a33f265f46871653c88d740/2:1/w_790,c_limit/justin-timberlake-will-smith-instagram.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "domain": "wmagazine.com"}, "version": "2.0.0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/txw965bK_lQ"], "publish_date": 1513356018.0, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
