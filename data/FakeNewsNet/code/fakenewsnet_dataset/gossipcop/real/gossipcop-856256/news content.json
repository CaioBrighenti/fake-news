During that time, he and Seaborn \u2014 who spent Labor Day weekend 2015 in Las Vegas with Swift\u2019s then-boyfriend Calvin Harris \u2014 built a strong foundation for their relationship.\n\n\u201c\u201cIt\u2019s quite weird being a touring \u2018celebrity\u2019 because people assume you\u2019re living the best f\u2014ing life in the world, but you don\u2019t really get to live any life because you work the whole time. I got to the end of [my last tour], and I was like \u2018F\u2014, I\u2019m 25 and haven\u2019t really lived.\u2019 I needed to have a year off and spend it with friends and family and Cherry and actually become a human being rather than a touring celebrity,\u201d Sheeran told PEOPLE in August 2018.\n\n\u201cThis has been the first time I\u2019ve actually had the time to fall in love properly,\u201d Sheeran told Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio last year.\n\n\u201cSo the catalyst of taking a year off was also the fact that my partner quit her job in New York \u2014 which she\u2019s now got back in London, which is really cool \u2014 but we were just basically like, let\u2019s quit our jobs and have a year of forming a tight bond. So we went traveling and spent every day for a year together,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably had three days apart from her in the last year\u2026but we\u2019re very, very strong. I\u2019ve never been happier. I\u2019ve never been more comfortable. I\u2019ve never been more inspired. I feel like everything\u2019s fallen into place, and it\u2019s fallen into place because I\u2019ve given it the time to fall into place,\u201d he added.", "images":
