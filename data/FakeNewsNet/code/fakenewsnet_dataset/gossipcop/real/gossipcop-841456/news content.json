Berkshire is located about an hour out of London and is where Pippa and Kate's parents, Carole Middleton and Michael Middleton live. St Mark's Resident priest Rev Nick Wynne-Jones will officiate the ceremony, a spokeswoman at the church has told The Telegraph.\n\nThe reception location\n\nThe reception will also be an intimate affair, held in the Middleton\u2019s back garden. According to A giant glass marquee has now been erected at the back of Pippa Middleton\u2019s family home in the lead up to her wedding, fit to host 350 guests.\n\nThe Bachelorette party\n\nIt happened back in March: here.\n\nThe wedding party\n\nThe Middleton\u2019s 27-year-old brother James Middleton is set to join Pippa's fianc\u00e9's three siblings to form the groomsmen, according to E!. There is no confirmation yet as to who will join Pippa. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are going to be taking on the roles of pageboy and bridesmaid respectively.\n\nThe role of royal author, Judy Wade weighed in on the nuptials saying Kate will most likely not be playing any formal part in the wedding, as it would detract from her sister. Kate's name has been omitted from a list of official duties for the wedding released by Kensington Palace, which details Prince George and Princess Charlotte's roles. Royal experts are suggesting she will still play a smaller role, perhaps by giving a reading during the ceremony.\n\nThe guests\n\nThe couple has settled on 150 guests. Prince Harry is definitely attending and is bringing Meghan Markle. Pippa and Kate\u2019s business entrepreneur brother James Middleton is attending and bringing his partner Donna Air. The groom\u2019s reality television star brother, Spencer Matthews, who stars on Made In Chelsea, is coming, along with sister Nina Mackie. Spencer will also serve as the groom\u2019s best man at the nuptials. Spencer\u2019s girlfriend however, Vogue Williams, did not receive an invite. According to The Mirror, tennis star Roger Federer has confirmed he is attending the relaxed nuptials.

Middleton is requesting her guests pack one outfit for the ceremony, set to take place at St Mark\u2019s church, Englefield, Berkshire, and another outfit for the reception, which is reported to be taking place at her parents\u2019 home.\n\nThe arrival\n\nThe Sun has reported Pippa Middleton will arrive at her wedding in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\nThe dress\n\nGiles Deacon is the favorite after he was spotted meeting Pippa and her mother last November. \u201cI can never really comment on rumours,\u201d he told here.\n\nThe beauty look\n\nJust four days before Pippa Middleton\u2019s wedding, Kate Middleton's hair stylist Amanda Cook Tucker has been spotted wheeling a suitcase into Pippa's Kensington home. According to The Daily Mail, Cook Tucker has spent time inside Pippa and James's home, likely creating a wedding day look for Pippa.
