She transformed from 80\u2019s ingenue to a full-fledged movie star in the 90s. At a certain point in her career, she was the highest paid actress. She\u2019s been in blockbuster after blockbuster and even some cult classics.\n\nIn honor of her milestone birthday, she is the cover girl on InStyle where she gets candid about specific aspects of joy. Roberts has been married to her husband, Danny Moder for 15 years and they have three children together, Phinnaeus, Henry, and Hazel.\n\nDuring the interview, she admitted three keys to joy she\u2019s fortunate to have: \u201cMarry the right person, give birth to a redhead, and have great girlfriends.\u201d\n\nThe redhead is oldest son Phinneaus, who is called Finn. He and twin sister Hazel are 12 years old.\n\nRoberts is also transitioning from the big screen to television as she\u2019s producing and starring in Amazon\u2019s upcoming project Homecoming, which is based on the popular podcast by the same name. She admits to being nervous about the differences as she\u2019s never done television before. She talks about how the quality of television has almost surpassed film in many ways: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go against my peoples, but it sort of is. There\u2019s a lot of really good content and a lot of diversity.\u201d The series begins filming next year.\n\nAs a woman in this industry, she does feel an interesting bit of introspection about the fact that everyone seems to be asking her about turning 50. Despite loving her birthday and the blessings of a new year, she can\u2019t help but think so many people are making a big deal out of it because she is a woman.\n\n\u201cDid anyone ever go over this with George Clooney or Brad [Pitt] before their 50th birthdays?\u201d She joked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt turns out that they do. The Today Show made a big deal of Pitt\u2019s 50th back in 2013.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Julia-Roberts-Star-on-Hollywood-Walk-of-Fame-700x466.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/avatar_user_39_1503571085-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/julia-roberts-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Beyonce-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/julia-roberts-pretty-woman-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maxresdefault-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/olivia-munn-1-300x218.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Julia-Roberts.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a16217805147eb643d80669362688d3e?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-3-300x187.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cassie-Ventura-Alex-Fine-Diddy-300x244.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Julia-Roberts.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Serene Hughes", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/julia-roberts-just-turned-50-and-says-the-key-to-joy-is-to-marry-the-right-person-81362/", "title": "Julia Roberts Just Turned 50 And Says The Key To Joy Is To \u201cMarry The Right Person\u201d", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Serene Hughes", "news_keywords": "julia roberts,", "keywords": "celebrity news, julia roberts,", "description": "One of the most popular movie stars in the world just celebrated a birthday and as an ode to her 30-year career, she's giving out life and career", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Julia Roberts Just Turned 50 And Says The Key To Joy Is To \u201cMarry The Right Person\u201d", "description": "One of the most popular movie stars in the world just celebrated a birthday and as an ode to her 30-year career, she's giving out life and career", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/julia-roberts-just-turned-50-and-says-the-key-to-joy-is-to-marry-the-right-person-81362/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Julia-Roberts.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-01", "modified_time": "2017-11-01", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/serenehughes/", "section": "Hollywood", "tag": "julia roberts"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509508800.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
