The plan is for Remini to develop a range of documentary content, beyond the subject of Scientology, for A&E, Lifetime, History and other in-house A+E platforms.\n\n\u201cI am so incredibly proud of this show and the movement that has started around it which continues to grow each and every day,\u201d said Remini. \u201cI\u2019m honored to have a home at A+E Networks and am grateful and humbled to have the opportunity to expand our relationship telling brave stories and bringing truth to light, no matter the obstacles.\u201d\n\n\u201cScientology and the Aftermath\u201d won the Emmy for informational series last year. The veteran actress\u2019 expose of the organization birthed by L. Ron Hubbard is one of a handful of docu-series successes (notably \u201c60 Days In\u201d and \u201cLive P.D.\u201d) that have generated renewed momentum for A&E, which had been struggling with double-digit viewership losses.\n\nA+E Originals was crafted by Paul Buccieri, president of A+E Networks Portfolio Group & A+E Studios, and a former unscripted producer. He\u2019s also serving as interim steward, with COO/CFO David Granville-Smith, of the entire A+E group as parent companies Hearst and Disney look for a CEO successor for Nancy Dubuc, who exited last month to become CEO of Vice. Former History exec Steve Ascher is leading the day-to-day charge at A+E Originals as VP.\n\n\u201cLeah is an incredible talent and collaborator with a unique point of view and we are looking forward to developing her brand of brave storytelling to new topics,\u201d said Buccieri. \u201cThe creation of A+E Originals provides the opportunity for us to partner directly with the industry\u2019s best nonfiction storytellers like Leah, both in front of and behind the camera, to bring their ideas to audiences around the world.\u201d\n\nThe unit expects to order at least 50 hours of programming this year. \u201cScientology\u201d has been renewed for eight hourlong episodes, plus five specials. \u201cScientology and the Aftermath\u201d is produced for A&E Network by the Intellectual Property Corporation.
