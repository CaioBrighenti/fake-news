The actor replied to a tweet which read, \"Woman who had sex with 20 ghosts is now engaged to a spirit\" with, \"THIS is how I find out?\"\n\nOf course the actor did the only thing he knew how when he stumbled across an article about a woman claiming to have sex with ghosts: pretend it's your wife. Now that he mentions it, though, the woman does look a bit like Blake. ~Suspicious~\n\nHere are all the other times Blake has trolled Ryan, and Ryan has trolled Blake.\n\n\n\nMarch 28, 2015 - Blake trolls Ryan\n\nBlake kicked the playful trolling off ahead of the first Deadpool movie, making fun of Ryan's pose.

The best man I know... you deserve this @time100 honor ... If only my husband wasn't blocking you in this shot. I'm so sorry @johnlegend\", she wrote.\n\nUnfortunately the photo has since been deleted, but you get the idea.\n\nAugust 25, 2017 - Ryan hits back on Blake's birthday\n\nRyan posted a picture of the two of them with half of Blake's face cut off with the caption, \"Happy Birthday to my amazing wife.\"\n\n\n\nOctober 19, 2017 - Blake trolls Ryan's fashion choices\n\nAfter changing five times(!) in one day, Blake reckons Ryan's getting a little complacent in his fashion choices, sharing a photo with the caption, \"@vancityreynolds didn\u2019t even do one outfit change from the sidewalk to the inside. (Lazy)\"\n\nOctober 23, 2017 - Blake gets revenge on Ryan's birthday\n\nThis is a personal favourite, after Blake shared a photo of half of her husband with Ryan Gosling, along with the caption, \"Happy Birthday, baby.\" Amazing.\n\n\n\nNovember 6, 2017 - Ryan trolls Blake's latest movie look\n\nRyan gets his own back (again), sharing a picture of Blake on set filming The Rhythm Section along with the caption, \"#nofilter\".

I could use a little \u201cme time\u201d. https://t.co/S6kXFsWaMe \u2014 Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) March 31, 2018\n\nThe actor managed to turn a rumour about their marriage breaking down into a hilarious way to troll his wife, quote tweeting \"Deadpool Ryan Reynolds and wife Blake Lively struggling to spend 'quality time'\" with, \"I wish. I could use a little 'me time'.\"\n\nApril 8, 2018 - Blake's more proud of her hair than her husband\n\n\"If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m infinitely proud of in this picture, it\u2019s the incredible hair styling that I did on myself\" she wrote, alongside a picture with Ryan at A Quiet Place premiere.\n\nMay 18, 2018 - Blake's back at it again in Ryan's Instagram comments\n\n'Is the extra distance between you supposed to convince me that you DON\u2019T love him more than me??

You once drove me to the hospital when you were giving birth. So\u2026 what the f*ck happened to Emily?\"\n\n\n\nYou can tell me. We\u2019re married. You once drove me to the hospital when you were giving birth.
