I think we overdo it with weddings in general and talking about it.\n\n\u201cI understand why people do it. It's a beautiful celebration of love and the meaningful experience of doing it in front of your friends and family,\u201d she said.\n\nMeghan and Ben\u2019s wedding comes at a sad time for the former Fox News host because her father is currently battling stage 4 brain cancer.\n\nMeghan spoke about getting married following her father Senator John McCain's cancer diagnosis.
