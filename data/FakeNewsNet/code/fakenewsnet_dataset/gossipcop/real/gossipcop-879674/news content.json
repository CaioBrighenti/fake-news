Polls have frequently cited the public view that she is not trusted, while Trump has rallied his supporters with the \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d epithet.\n\nHer links to Wall Street, her missing emails and her supposed responsibility for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the Benghazi consulate are the ostensible reasons for some deeply personal attacks in 2016. But the roots of hostility towards her go much deeper.\n\nCraig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a conservative political consultant, said that, when Hillary Clinton arrived in Washington DC as first lady, \u201cshe came from Little Rock with a reputation already established\u201d as \u201csuch a militant feminist, difficult to deal with\u201d.\n\nHe noted that she faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill Clinton was first elected governor, because she kept her maiden name.\u201cHere she comes, the feminist from Wellesley and Yale,\u201d Shirley explained of the supposedly prevailing attitude of the time, \u201cdown to Little Rock and brings her attitudes with her\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people Craig Shirley, conservative political consultant\n\nSo by the time she arrived on the national stage in 1991, during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the then-still-mostly-male press corps already had an idea of who they understood Hillary Clinton to be \u2013 a potential liability to her husband\u2019s political career whose feminism and ambition were a bit unseemly.\n\n\n\nAnd, as she noted in her first autobiography, she gave them plenty of material with which to support that narrative. First, there was her much-maligned \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette\u201d comment in response to a reporter\u2019s assertion that she and her husband had \u201csome sort of understanding and arrangement\u201d about his infidelity.\n\nThen, her out-of-context \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies\u201d comment, which came in response to attacks, which the Clintons denied, by now-California governor Jerry Brown that she had only been a successful lawyer because her husband had steered business to her firm, implying that she should have confined herself to being a ceremonial first lady.\n\nAnd then, of course, came the scandals in which she was involved: Whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which she\u2019d invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment illegally; and Travelgate, in which she \u2013 contrary to the then-normal practice of leaving the business of the White House to the president\u2019s staff \u2013 was said to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office, who coincidentally was popular with the mostly-male White House press corps whose travel he arranged.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest President Bill Clinton takes his oath of office, accompanied by Hillary Rodham Clinton, in 1993.

The Starr investigation, which eventually resulted in Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment, found that she had not, but by that time her reputation was established as someone unfriendly to the media who also maybe did not do the right thing.\n\nThis business of people \u2018not liking\u2019 her is shaped ... by what we think people in authority ought to look like Elaine Kamarck, Brookings Institution fellow\n\nShirley conceded that \u201cthe press pounded on her\u201d first in Arkansas and then in Washington, but did not believe that affected her relationship with the media, or that it was a driving factor in people\u2019s attitudes towards her. \u201cThere\u2019s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like to be talked down to, and she has a terrible habit of talking down to people, with that smirk.\u201d\n\nHowever, Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, said she did not think that people\u2019s dislike of Hillary Clinton is her own fault. \u201cThis business of people \u2018not liking\u2019 her is shaped by expectations, by television, by what we think people in authority ought to look like, and not who she actually is,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe is absolutely as likable, or more likable, than many male politicians,\u201d she said. But while it is rare that people will compare a male politician they do not like to their fathers Kamarck noted that Clinton \u201creminds people of their mothers, or the schoolteacher they didn\u2019t like.\u201d (References to a \u201cnagging wife\u201d and \u201cbitchy wife\u201d are also common.)\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s some misogyny in that,\u201d said Kamarck, noting that it\u2019s exceedingly common for men who don\u2019t hew to conventional standards of attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are more likely to be granted that visibility when they are younger and if they meet traditional beauty standards.\n\n\u201cWe will overcome this but, right now, the world is accustomed to saying old men are fine, they\u2019re strong, they\u2019re wise,\u201d she added. \u201cOld women, we\u2019re not so sure.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76db89a96aa5d27b9601044fb4d99ceab3365a35/154_409_4319_2591/master/4319.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c955ece6c11d1bb4f3f8136267a7c442", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1730dcf51637b7ecd2cb110469e0b4b3e5eee999/0_79_2544_1528/master/2544.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0aadbdbe77347069c169403c1635d6c5", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Hillary+Clinton%2CUS+elections+2016%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CBill+Clinton", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/971225648/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76db89a96aa5d27b9601044fb4d99ceab3365a35/154_409_4319_2591/master/4319.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fad4827ad02827d94e7c83887811dfea"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76db89a96aa5d27b9601044fb4d99ceab3365a35/154_409_4319_2591/master/4319.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fad4827ad02827d94e7c83887811dfea", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Carpentier"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/18/hillary-clinton-why-hate-unlikeable-us-election", "title": "Why do people dislike Hillary Clinton?
