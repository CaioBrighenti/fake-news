Its first big-budget movie, Bright, starring Will Smith and available on December 22, hasn\u2019t exactly been embraced by critics, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the director from embracing the reviews.\n\nIn a review on Indiewire, writer David Ehrlich said the film was the worst of 2017. He called it \u201cprofoundly awful,\u201d further describing the sci-fi cop flick as \u201cpainfully derivative\u201d and downright \u201cdull.\u201d They\u2019re harsh criticisms, for sure, but when director David Ayer read the review, he reacted in the most positive way possible.\n\n\u201cThis is going on my fridge. Highest compliment is a strong reaction either way,\u201d he tweeted at the writer. But it didn\u2019t stop there \u2014 the director also took the time to note Ehrlich\u2019s writing skills. \u201cThis is a f*cking epic review. It\u2019s a big fun movie. You can sure string words together, Mr. Ehrlich. I\u2019d love to read any script you\u2019ve written.\u201d\n\nTalk about a lesson in taking criticism well! The writer responded with much nicer words this time around, praising the director for his kindess and letting him know it was nothing personal.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Mr. Ayer,\u201d Ehrlich wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting with fresh eyes for whatever comes next.\u201d\n\nyou\u2019re a good man, mr. Ayer. i'll be waiting with fresh eyes for whatever comes next. \u2014 david ehrlich (@davidehrlich) December 21, 2017\n\nAyer replied earnestly, writing, \u201cI really appreciate that. Every movie is a labor of love for me. I\u2019ve never chased the audience, and I know my work can be polarizing. I\u2019ve lived a crazy love and I guess my movies reflect that.\u201d\n\nIn a time when online discourse seems to descend too frequently into anger and arguments, it\u2019s refreshing to see two people be respectful of each other \u2014 especially when someone\u2019s feelings are very much at stake. The best part? It actually made us want to watch Bright even more.\n\nWhat did you think of the director\u2019s reaction? Let us know @BritandCo!\n\n(photos via Netflix + John Phillips/Getty Images)", "images": ["https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/relationships_header.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://bourbon.britcdn.com/assets/menu-icon.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Style_Content-Hub_1920x260_v4_lighter-version.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/David-Ayer.jpg?auto=format&q=50", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Issues_header_1920x5001.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://components.britcdn.com/assets/images/logo.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/beauty_1024.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://components.britcdn.com/assets/images/logo_condensed.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/food_header.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bright-US.jpg?auto=format&q=50", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/home_header_1920x500.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://bourbon.britcdn.com/assets/x-icon.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/David-Ayer.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/David-Ayer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Villeneuve", "Nicole Is An Entertainment", "Lifestyle Writer Covering Pop Culture", "News", "Cool Women Doing Cool Things.
