But he did know the words to Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Are the Champions,\u201d which they launched into next.\n\n\u201cDID YOU KNOW: @GatenM123 of #StrangerThings has an awesome voice?\u201d Clarkson wrote alongside the clip, which she shared on social media. \u201cSee us and more awesome people on the #WEday special\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch the kids of Stranger Things try to explain the show in 30 seconds\n\nMatarazzo also shared the clip on his Instagram account, saying \u201cWhen you hear the epic performance from @KellyClarkson on the #WEday special tomorrow at 7pm, you\u2019ll know who to thank! Check it out on CTV!\u201d\n\nLast year, Selena Gomez hosted the third annual We Day Special, which featured special appearances by Demi Lovato, Tyrese Gibson, Alicia Keys, Alessia Cara with STOMP, Josh Gad and DJ Khaled.\n\nThe WE Day special airs Nov. 25 at 7 p.m. on CTV.", "images":
