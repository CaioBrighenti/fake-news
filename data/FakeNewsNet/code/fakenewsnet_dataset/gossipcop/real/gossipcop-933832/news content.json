And it pissed me off in the end, because it was like, 'You could have been this guy, but you chose to do this,'\" the 24-year-old star explained in the cover story. \"Nobody really knew anything about me. I put on a front that wasn't really me. But now that I\u2019ve had my time away, you slowly, naturally become the person you were before you started, but with a lot more knowledge. So I feel a lot more myself than I ever did before, rather than being a part of something and having a part to play or treading on eggshells around someone.\"\n\nPayne also recalled the day that the group completed all their obligations, admitting that he was quite ready to take a breather from things. \"I remember the day we finished, because of the place I was in, I was quite happy that we had a break. I said to the person with me at the time, 'Thank god I don\u2019t have to play that person again for a long time.' It was exhausting and I couldn\u2019t keep up with myself,'\" the singer explained.\n\nIt was a transition that helped him grow alongside his former bandmates and he'll always be thankful for that. \"I went away and the person I was in the band, I'm not him now. It was all right to be that person then, but now, I need to be something totally different,\" he continued. \"Even going to see Louis the other day \u2013 it\u2019s nice to meet people and have them see how you are now, because you can understand all the things you might have done wrong or the things you might have regretted doing. You can say, 'I'm different now, so whatever that was in the past, we were different people.\u2019 We got on well in One Direction, but there were times when we didn\u2019t. Certain members fell out with each other sometimes, but it would always come back round. So, I don\u2019t ever think that I won\u2019t be friends with these people for life. But I think it\u2019s important in anything that you can think about everything you would have liked to change about yourself and then grow.\"", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a86f72b7fbdef7fdf06f377?ops=contain(740,0)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a86f72b7fbdef7fdf06f377", "https://www.iheart.com/aclogo.7c8e56771c2208dff83e6123e794ef10.png"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a86f72b7fbdef7fdf06f377", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Dinh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-05-09-liam-payne-says-one-directions-fame-made-him-a-little-bit-nuts/", "title": "Liam Payne Says One Direction's Fame Made Him 'A Little Bit Nuts'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#C6002B", "description": "Payne said that he put on a front while he was in the pop collective | iHeartRadio", "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831, "pages": 55354819171}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a86f72b7fbdef7fdf06f377", "description": "Payne said that he put on a front while he was in the pop collective | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-05-09-liam-payne-says-one-directions-fame-made-him-a-little-bit-nuts/", "site_name": "iHeartRadio", "title": "Liam Payne Says One Direction's Fame Made Him 'A Little Bit Nuts' | iHeartRadio"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a86f72b7fbdef7fdf06f377", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a86f72b7fbdef7fdf06f377", "src": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a86f72b7fbdef7fdf06f377"}, "description": "Payne said that he put on a front while he was in the pop collective | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-05-09-liam-payne-says-one-directions-fame-made-him-a-little-bit-nuts/", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "iHeartRadio", "ipad": "iHeartRadio", "googleplay": "iHeartRadio"}, "id": {"iphone": 290638154, "ipad": 290638154, "googleplay": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}}, "creator": "@iHeartRadio", "site": "@iHeartRadio", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "iheart.com", "title": "Liam Payne Says One Direction's Fame Made Him 'A Little Bit Nuts' | iHeartRadio"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "package": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}, "ios": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "app_store_id": 290638154}}, "keywords": "Liam Payne Says One Direction's Fame Made Him 'A Little Bit Nuts', liam, payne, says, one, direction's, fame, made, him, 'a, little, bit, nuts'", "parsely-author": "James Dinh", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a86f72b7fbdef7fdf06f377", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-05-09-liam-payne-says-one-directions-fame-made-him-a-little-bit-nuts/", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-05-09T17:30:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "iheartradio-music-news", "parsely-tags": "Liam Payne (31597487),One Direction (687496)", "parsely-title": "Liam Payne Says One Direction's Fame Made Him 'A Little Bit Nuts'", "parsely-type": "post"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525838400.0, "source": "https://www.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
