Of course, it\u2019s hard not to look at the sight of Kim\u2014and her famously curvaceous figure\u2014in little more than a few strips of Lycra. But being the reality star she is, she soon shrugged it off. \u201cI realized I felt good. I wasn\u2019t as insecure as I\u2019ve always been,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable in my own skin.\u201d\n\nBelieve it or not, arriving at this bikini photo op has taken a long time for Kardashian, 28. The second of four children, she recalls bypassing her older sister Kourtney on the puberty fast lane, developing \u201chuge boobs and a butt\u201d by age 11. In 2006 she found fame as Paris Hilton\u2018s BFF and Nick Lachey\u2018s blink-and-you-missed-it love interest. But the spotlight brought a harsh glare: She quickly earned the nickname The Tush from bloggers who scrutinized her weight. \u201cI wasn\u2019t heavy, but I was being criticized left and right,\u201d she says now. \u201cIt really brought me down.\u201d\n\nAs Kim\u2019s stardom grew, thanks in part to the hit E! reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, her confidence sagged. Despite a shape most women would kill for\u2014with 128 lbs. on her 5\u20193\u2033 frame, she was a size 6, she says\u2014Kim wouldn\u2019t walk on the beach without a cover-up. \u201cI\u2019m most self-conscious about my thighs,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone talks about this great butt I had, but I was so unhappy about it.\u201d\n\nEach year she\u2019d vow, \u201cI will have my perfect body by summer,\u201d but gave up by Memorial Day. Then she opted to be more realistic. \u201cI wanted to be comfortable, fit and toned,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear Spanx all the time.\u201d\n\nSo, after \u201ccountless\u201d failed attempts at her dream body, Kardashian began daily hour-long workouts in late 2008 and now enlists celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson (see sidebar). \u201cI\u2019d always work out a day or two but lose motivation,\u201d she says. \u201cI finally realized you have to be consistent. I needed a workout buddy or a trainer to meet.\u201d\n\nShe also began using QuickTrim, a dietary supplement and cleanser that she and younger sister Khlo\u00e9 just launched with GNC. \u201cI needed something to kick loose those last 5 or 10 lbs.,\u201d she says. Recently she reached a trim 113 lbs. and now is a size 2. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s finally all clicked.\u201d\n\nKim also tackled her lifelong love affair with junk food. Instead of eating burgers and fries, she sticks to salads and grilled chicken and limits sweets. \u201cI can\u2019t lose focus,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard to get here.\u201d\n\nStill, she says she\u2019s a work in progress. \u201cI love my curves, but let\u2019s be honest: Cellulite isn\u2019t cute. Would I rather not have any? Of course! But I\u2019m proud of my body,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there is something you\u2019re not happy about, you can\u2019t just sit there. You have to put all your effort into fixing it.\u201d\n\nSuch a proactive approach has gotten Kardashian through her public love life. Her marriage of more than three years to music producer Damon Thomas ended in 2003; a few years later a private sex tape she made with R&B singer Ray J, her then-boyfriend, leaked onto the Internet. \u201cNo one should be judged by one mistake,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s how you handle yourself after the mistake. You have to learn from things.\u201d And in July she ended her two-year relationship with NFL running back Reggie Bush, 24. \u201cThat was really hard,\u201d Kim says. \u201cWe both have a lot of love and respect for each other,\u201d hinting that the door might still be open down the line for a reconciliation (in fact, the two were spotted spending time together last month in New Orleans, though they remain split for now). \u201cSometimes people need a break to put things in perspective. Everything was amicable; it just wasn\u2019t working right now. But you never know what will happen.\u201d\n\nThough boyfriendless at the moment, Kardashian doesn\u2019t long for company. Her close-knit clan\u2014sisters Kourtney, 30 (who recently announced that she is having a baby with boyfriend Scott Disick, 26, around Christmas [\u201dI\u2019m so excited to be an auntie,\u201d says Kim. \u201cI will spoil this baby so much\u201d]), and Khlo\u00e9, 25, brother Robert, 22, mom Kris Jenner, 53, stepfather Bruce Jenner, 59, and half sisters Kylie, 12, and Kendall, 13\u2014is never far away and always in touch. \u201cAs many things as I\u2019ve been through, my family has made my life what it is,\u201d says Kim, who also credits her father, Robert Kardashian (the famed O.J. Simpson attorney who died of cancer in 2003) with teaching her to believe in herself. \u201cHis decision to stick up for his friends when everyone told him not to taught me to do what you believe in,\u201d she says.\n\nHaving been raised with such a strong sense of family, she definitely wants one of her own someday. \u201cI want to be married and have four kids. But right now life is moving very fast.\u201d So fast, she barely has time to soak up the sun in the bikini body she worked so hard to flaunt. \u201cI finally feel like I\u2019m in the best shape of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is who I am. And I\u2019m loving it!\u201d\n\nFOR THE LATEST ON KIM, GO TO PEOPLE.COM/KIM_KARDASHIAN", "images":
