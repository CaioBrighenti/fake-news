They wanted us both to do it \u2014 they wanted Drew and I to go head-to-head.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t count Jonathan out just yet. He teases that he and his fraternal twin brother, 39, may pull one a classic prank on the panel of judges this season.\n\n\u201cWe may have discussed that if Drew gets injured, we just swap costumes, I step in and win the whole thing for him,\u201d Jonathan says. \u201cI wonder if the judges would even notice \u2014 we should try it! Not even for the real competition, we should see if I walked out in the costume if the judges could even tell the difference.\u201d\n\nWATCH: The Scott Brothers Reveal the Time They Got Out of a Traffic Ticket Because They\u2019re the \u2018Property Brothers\u2019\n\nJonathan also admits that he\u2019s enjoying watching Drew go through the \u201cawkward\u201d phase of learning how to dance with pro partner and season 24 champ Emma Slater.\n\n\u201cDrew is very analytical\u2026so I said to him, \u2018You have to practice smiling!\u2019 Because Drew is very serious,\u201d Jonathan says. \u201cHe\u2019s very competitive, so he\u2019ll do well. If anyone can whip him into shape, it will be Emma. She just makes it fun and she knows how to win, so let\u2019s go for two Mirror Balls in a row!\u201d\n\nProperty Brothers airs on HGTV while season 25 of ABC\u2019s Dancing with the Stars kicks off
