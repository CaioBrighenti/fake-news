{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Modern_Family_characters", "text": "Modern Family is an American TV comedy series revolving around three families that are interrelated through Jay Pritchett, his son Mitchell Pritchett, and his daughter Claire Dunphy. The families meet for family functions (usually around their three neighborhoods or while traveling during vacations) and cross-family bonding.\n\nMain Cast [ edit ]\n\nThe Dunphy family [ edit ]\n\nPhil Dunphy [ edit ]\n\nPhil Dunphy First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Ty Burrell Information Gender Male Occupation Realtor and magic store owner Family Frank Dunphy (father)\n\nGrace Dunphy (mother; deceased)\n\nLorraine Dunphy (step-mother)\n\nRay (step-brother) Spouse Claire Dunphy ( m. 1993) Children Haley Marshall (daughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (daughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (son) Relatives Jay Pritchett (father-in-law)\n\nDeDe Pritchett (mother-in-law; deceased)\n\nGloria Pritchett (step-mother-in-law)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (brother-in-law)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half-brother-in-law)\n\nManny Delgado (step-brother-in-law)\n\nCameron Tucker (brother-in-law)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive niece by marriage)\n\nDylan Marshall (son-in-law)\n\nPhilip Humphrey \"Phil\" Dunphy (Ty Burrell) is Claire's husband of 25 years who sees himself as the \"cool dad\".[1] He dotes on his wife Claire and constantly tries to find ways to bond with his three kids.[1] He is seen as very competitive, one example being his nature of always beating his son at basketball. He has a very juvenile attitude, and is referred to by Claire as the \"kid [she's] married to\". He uses a parenting method that he calls \"peerenting\", which is a combination of talking like a peer but acting like a parent.[1]\n\nTy Burrell portrays Phil Dunphy, the father of three children and Claire's husband\n\nPhil is a real estate agent who is very confident in his work, once saying \"I could sell a fur coat to an Eskimo.\"[1] Phil has a severe case of coulrophobia, which is first revealed when despite Mitchell's objection, Cameron comes to Luke's party dressed as a clown. This may stem from Phil's having found a dead clown in the woods when he was a child. Phil appears to love home repair yet never seems to get around to any of the jobs requested by Claire. Throughout season 1, his ongoing project is fixing the step. He at times shows a sort of crush-like affection for Gloria. However, he says he \"would never stray from Claire,\" although Gloria did kiss him during a \"kisscam\" segment at a basketball game in the final episode of season 1, \"Family Portrait\". He is also staring at her when she does something that makes Phil think she is sexy.[1] In college, he was a cheerleader at Fresno State and his birthday is on April 3.[2]\n\nPhil seems oblivious as to what he says by miscalculating (if at all) the consequences of his expressions, such as \"Phil Dunphy is no straight guy\" (when he is referring to not being a straight man)[3] or \"If you ain't white, you ain't right\" (referring to the color of a team that he was playing on).[4] He is often looking for approval from Jay because Jay generally does not openly show approval of anyone, often causing Phil to fear for his approval in Jay's eyes. Phil is always reminding Jay of when he fixed his wireless printer, trying to show Jay that he can be manly. In the Season 3 episode \"Dude Ranch\", Phil shows considerable skill both on horseback and with a shotgun.\n\nIn moments of acute adversity or shock in which most people would curse or swear, Phil utters humorous exclamations: references to food such as, \"Sweet Potato Fries!\" or \"Chicken in a basket!\", etc. or he might make a historical reference such as \"John Philip Sousa!\". It is revealed in \"Tableau Vivant\" that Phil had once tried to break up with Claire but didn't have the courage to do so.\n\nA running gag in the show has Phil is running up the stairs (often when carrying an object) and tripping on a loose step, which causes him to quickly and hastily say: \"Gotta fix that step!\"\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nTy Burrell had received many positive reviews for his performance. Hank Stuever from the Washington Post wrote, \"A standout performance from Ty Burrell's new twist on the doofus-dad stereotype.\"[5] Paige Wiser, a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times, wrote, \"Ty Burrell is a genius as a dad who stays hip by keeping up with the numbers from High School Musical.\"[6] Robert Canning of IGN in a review of the season loved Ty Burrell's performance of Phil Dunphy and named him one of two characters that stood out to him saying \"actor Ty Burrell owned this part, and his well-intended faux pas throughout the season were stellar.\"[7]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nIn 2010, Ty Burrell received a nomination for the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy, winning in 2011. In 2011 and 2014, Burrell won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, also receiving nominations in 2010, 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Burrell won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. In 2014, Burrell won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series, receiving nominations in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016. In 2010 and 2011, Burrell was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film.\n\nOther appearances [ edit ]\n\nOn May 4, 2016, Phil appeared in the first commercials for the National Association of Realtors telling about his \"Phil's-osophies\". Arnold Worldwide executive creative director Sean McBride said Phil was written as a Realtor on his show and \"embodies many of the attributes that are important in a Realtor: He's honest, he's helpful, he's sincere.\"[8]\n\nClaire Dunphy [ edit ]\n\nClaire Dunphy First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Julie Bowen Information Gender Female Occupation President of Prichett Closets and Blinds.

She is often exhausted from stress created by her family but is still a loving mother.[9] When it comes to her kids she has difficulty controlling Haley's independence and irresponsibility, Alex's manipulative nature, and Luke's lack of common sense.[9] She also gets annoyed with her husband, Phil, constantly.\n\nJulie Bowen portrays Claire Dunphy, the mother of three and Phil's wife\n\nClaire is very competitive especially in her obsession of being right, and has a brittle personality that causes her to get angry, paranoid, and freak out easily. She is very strict about a clean house. She is seen as an experienced parent by Cameron and Mitchell, so she is called upon for her parenting advice. She enjoys running and reading. She is also very attached to Halloween and describes it as her \"crazy lady holiday\". In the episode \"Open House of Horrors\", it is revealed that the neighbors are frightened of Claire's very graphic and realistic decorations around the house. Claire is also the most active family member when organizing family get-togethers. When a former co-worker (Minnie Driver) visits, it is revealed that Claire had a successful job in hospitality management but left her job and married Phil a few months after she became pregnant with Haley. She shows resentment towards the abandonment of her working career due to seeing the success of one of her former peers, but later realizes her family is more important.[10]\n\nClaire is a perfectionist; according to Phil, \"when everybody else sees something beautiful, all she sees is the teeny-tiny flaw.\" She is also terrible at giving gifts. As her husband Phil once bought her a bracelet for their anniversary, she made him coupons for five free hugs which she was very proud of.\n\nHer step-brother is Manny Delgado. Claire received another sibling through Jay's second wife Gloria \u2013 Fulgencio \"Joe\". She often despises the attention that Gloria gets for her voluptuous figure, and was thrilled to learn that Gloria was pregnant because of all the weight that Gloria would be gaining.\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nJulie Bowen's performance was praised by Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly who said, \"Bowen's Claire could have been a blank blonde cipher. Far from it: Bowen's wide array of silent gazes at the camera, her slow-burns at her clan's bad behavior, and her ability to freak out without seeming nutso crazy makes her an essential, stand-out part of TV's best freshman ensemble cast.\"[11]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nIn 2011 and 2012, Julie Bowen won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, receiving nominations in 2010 and 2013. In 2012, Bowen won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She has also been nominated twice for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series in 2012 and 2014. In 2009, Bowen was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy, and then for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries, or Television Film in 2010.\n\nHaley Marshall [ edit ]\n\nHaley Marshall First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Sarah Hyland Information Gender Female Occupation Assistant Fashion Designer at Gavin Sinclair\n\nStyle editor for Nerp Family Phil Dunphy (father)\n\nClaire Dunphy (mother)\n\nAlex Dunphy (sister)\n\nLuke Dunphy (brother)\n\nFarrah Marshall (mother-in-law)\n\nMr. Marshall (father-in-law) Spouse Dylan Marshall ( m. 2019) Significant other Andy Bailey (ex-boyfriend)\n\nRainer Shine (ex-boyfriend)\n\nDr. Arvin Fennerman (ex-boyfriend) Children 2 (with Dylan Marshall) Relatives Frank Dunphy (paternal grandfather)\n\nGrace Dunphy (paternal grandmother; deceased)\n\nJay Pritchett (maternal grandfather)\n\nDeDe Pritchett (maternal grandmother; deceased)\n\nLorraine Dunphy (paternal step-grandmother)\n\nRay (paternal step-uncle)\n\nGloria Pritchett (maternal step-grandmother)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (maternal uncle)\n\nJoe Pritchett (maternal half-uncle)\n\nManny Delgado (maternal step-uncle)\n\nCameron Tucker (maternal uncle by marriage)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (maternal adoptive cousin)\n\nHaley Gwendolyn Marshall (nee Dunphy) (Sarah Hyland) is the eldest daughter of Claire and Phil, who is portrayed as the stereotypical teenager.[12] Haley was born on December 10, 1993.[13] At the start of the series, Haley is a high school sophomore. Haley is depicted as being rather a flirt, who focuses more on social status than studies. She is a little naive, especially when it comes to arguing with her parents.[12] However, she is at times surprisingly cunning, such as when she carves a cell phone out of soap to win a contest to see who can go the longest without using technology.\n\nSarah Hyland portrays Haley Marshall, one of the daughters\n\nHaley is embarrassed by her dad, especially when he tries to be friends with her boyfriend Dylan (to whom she lost her virginity, as revealed in Season 3).[12] She is concerned about her popularity at school, as well as her social and sexual life, which contributes to her being embarrassed by her parents. Haley contemplated moving in with Dylan before learning that she got into college in the final episode of the third season. After a run-in with the law on campus in Season 4, she is expelled from college and moves back into the Dunphy home. She begins a fashion blog and goes to community college to study business and photography, eventually showing her photos in an exhibit at which she sells them. In Season 6, she gets a job working for fashion designer Gavin Sinclair as his assistant, doing some of her own design work. In season 9 episode 13, she starts working at lifestyle company Nerp.\n\nThroughout Season 6, Haley develops feelings for Andy (Jay and Gloria's hired nanny) and they begin hanging out often. In the episode \"White Christmas\", Andy and Haley begin a relationship. At the end of Season 7, Andy is offered a job in his hometown in Utah and initially turns it down, but Haley encourages him to pursue it, insisting that they will figure out a way to be together. As they say goodbye at the airport, she admits that Andy is the first man she has ever really loved. As of \"Weathering Heights\", she is dating weatherman Rainer Shine. Although they broke up later in the season after he proposed and they both realized they weren't ready. In thirteen episode of season 9, \"In Your Head\", she starts dating Dr. Arvin Fennerman, Alex's astrophysics teacher at Caltech. However, a divorced Dylan reappears in the season 10 premiere and confesses he's still in love with her and wants to be worthy of her. They sleep together, and Haley finds herself in love with both men. In the fourth episode of the season, \"Torn Between Two Lovers\", she finally decides Dylan is \"the one\" and breaks up with Arvin.\n\nIn the episode \"Did the Chicken Cross the Road?\", she finds out she is pregnant. In the episode \"Can't Elope\", she marries Dylan. In the episode \"A Year of Birthdays\", she gives birth to twins, a boy and girl.\n\nAlex Dunphy [ edit ]\n\nAlex Dunphy First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Ariel Winter Information Gender Female Occupation Student Family Phil Dunphy (father)\n\nClaire Dunphy (mother)\n\nHaley Marshall (sister)\n\nLuke Dunphy (brother) Significant other Sanjay Patel (ex-boyfriend)\n\nBen (ex-boyfriend) Relatives Frank Dunphy (paternal grandfather)\n\nGrace Dunphy (paternal grandmother; deceased)\n\nJay Pritchett (maternal grandfather)\n\nDeDe Pritchett (maternal grandmother; deceased)\n\nLorraine Dunphy (paternal step-grandmother)\n\nRay (paternal step-uncle)\n\nGloria Pritchett (maternal step-grandmother)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (maternal uncle)\n\nJoe Pritchett (maternal half-uncle)\n\nManny Delgado (maternal step-uncle)\n\nCameron Tucker (maternal uncle by marriage)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (maternal adoptive cousin)\n\nDylan Marshall (brother-in-law)\n\nAlexandra Anastasia \"Alex\" Dunphy (Ariel Winter) (born March 15, 1998) begins as the almost 13-year-old daughter of Claire and Phil and turns 17 in season five. Characteristically nerdy but still cute nonetheless, Alex is the most intelligent of the three siblings and a polar opposite of Haley. She is very bright and cares much more about her studies than friends/social life and boys.[14] As the middle child to a shallow big sister and a goofy younger brother, she enjoys messing with them.[14] Often taking advantage of their na\u00efvet\u00e9 by fooling them into believing unrealistic things, she at one time convinced Haley and Luke that they could charge electronics by rubbing the battery on their heads (Haley) and putting it in their mouths (Luke).[12] She also convinced Luke that he was actually Phil's old girlfriend's son and that Jay was dying.\n\nAriel Winter portrays Alex Dunphy, one of the daughters\n\nAs a stereotypical precocious kid, Alex displays a sense of superiority due to her intelligence, constantly putting her accomplishments on display and demanding recognition for them. An overachiever, she plays the cello; she chose to play the cello because she would have a better chance at being in a university orchestra than if she played the violin as cellos are more in demand. While she has sometimes felt isolated from her peers (once sadly telling her parents \"I have no friends\"), she has a group of nerdy fans at school who idolize her. Haley sincerely tells Alex at one point she is smart and attractive in a successful effort to get her to give a light-hearted graduation speech instead of a harsh one (it worked well enough that her classmates invited her to a post-ceremony party). At the beginning of Season 3, she was in a long-distance relationship with a boy she met in Wyoming. Later in the season, she went to her prom with a classmate who everyone but himself knows is gay.\n\nIt was established in the episode \"Tableau Vivant\" that Alex is a light sleeper, as she was surprisingly energetic when staying awake nearly a whole night thinking about her upcoming art project. The episode \"Heart Broken\" reveals that Alex suffers from hemophobia. In the second episode of Season 5 onwards, she started wearing new glasses. In Season 6, Alex is currently seeking the best college to enroll in and have a thought about getting away from her family for a while. While Alex was not accepted into Harvard, she was accepted into Caltech, where she has been attending since the start of Season 7. She had to leave for a little due to getting mono. She was seen to be dating Sanjay Patel until he broke up with her in \"The Closet Case\".\n\nIn season 8, she has a relationship with Ben, who works at Pritchett's Closets & Blinds, but later breaks up with him. As of the season 9 episode \"Royal Visit\", she's dating Bill, a firefighter who rescued her when she burned a bagel in her room's microwave. Though he is handsome and muscular, Alex is a bit ashamed because he is not very smart.\n\nLuke Dunphy [ edit ]\n\nLuke Dunphy First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Nolan Gould Information Gender Male Occupation Student Family Phil Dunphy (father)\n\nClaire Dunphy (mother)\n\nHaley Marshall (sister)\n\nAlex Dunphy (sister) Relatives Frank Dunphy (paternal grandfather)\n\nGrace Dunphy (paternal grandmother; deceased)\n\nJay Pritchett (maternal grandfather)\n\nDeDe Pritchett (maternal grandmother; deceased)\n\nLorraine Dunphy (paternal step-grandmother)\n\nRay (paternal step-uncle)\n\nGloria Pritchett (maternal step-grandmother)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (maternal uncle)\n\nJoe Pritchett (maternal half-uncle)\n\nManny Delgado (maternal step-uncle)\n\nCameron Tucker (maternal uncle by marriage)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (maternal adoptive cousin)\n\nDylan Marshall (brother-in-law)\n\nLucas Philip \"Luke\" Dunphy (Nolan Gould) is Claire and Phil's rambunctious son, who is often doing his own thing.[15] He was named after his great-grandfather, Lucas (DeDe's father). At times, he can be a troublemaker, once shooting his sister with a toy gun and getting into a fight with Manny at school. Luke is playful, very innocent and does not always understand the repercussions of his actions, like most children; he once announced at a family gathering that his mom thought her dad's new wife was a \"gold digger\", although he had misheard it as \"coal digger\".[15]\n\nNolan Gould portrays Lucas Dunphy, the son\n\nLuke is also thought to be rather vacuous because of many questionable actions, such as getting his head stuck in the banister and jumping on the trampoline wearing only underwear and a box on his head.[15] Both parents agree that they \"dropped the ball\" in regard to raising Luke; Phil once tells Claire that he considers Luke to be their dumbest child (although he conceded to Claire's assertion that Haley was, in fact, dumber than Luke). A psychologist who evaluated him said his type of behavior was normal for someone with above-average intelligence; afterwards, Phil and Claire accidentally left a wandering Luke behind when they left the psychologist's office, but they ended up being impressed by how calmly he made his way back home (in a limo) and decided he would do just fine in life. Subsequent events have borne this out, as he only got into one college he applied to (and did so because Phil gave up some magic secrets to his former rival-turned-Dean of Admissions) but has become a well-paid social fixture at Jay's country club and shows he can use his connections to help his family. He is frequently seen playing a Nintendo 3DS. Throughout the series, he is often seen playing with Manny. Often, they do not just play, but develop plans, plots, and ploys. Being that Luke's birthday is November 28, it usually coincides with Thanksgiving.[17]\n\nThe Pritchett-Delgado family [ edit ]\n\nJay Pritchett [ edit ]\n\nJay Pritchett First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Ed O'Neill Information Gender Male Occupation Retired business owner Family Mr. Pritchett (father; deceased)\n\nMrs. Pritchett (mother; deceased)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (brother)\n\nBecky Pritchett (sister) Spouse DeDe Pritchett\n\n( m. 1968; div. 2003) [note 1]\n\nGloria Pritchett ( m. 2009) Children Claire Dunphy (daughter)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (son)\n\nManny Delgado (step-son)\n\nJoe Pritchett (son) Relatives Irene Pritchett (sister-in-law)\n\nMichael Pritchett (nephew)\n\nMelanie Pritchett (great-niece)\n\nPhil Dunphy (son-in-law)\n\nCameron Tucker (son-in-law)\n\nHaley Marshall (granddaughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (grandson)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive granddaughter)\n\nLucas Williams (ex-father-in-law; deceased)\n\nMrs. Williams (ex-mother-in-law; deceased)\n\nBeBe Williams (ex-sister-in-law)\n\nCeCe Williams (ex-sister-in-law)\n\nDylan Marshall (grandson-in-law)\n\nJay Francis Pritchett (Ed O'Neill) is the father of Claire, Mitchell and Joe; husband of Gloria; maternal grandfather of Haley, Alex and Luke; adoptive grandfather of Lily; father-in-law of Phil and Cam; and step-father of Manny. He is the owner of a closet company and is presumably the wealthiest family member as well occasionally the chieftain of the family in many situations. Jay has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor. Like his son and daughter, Jay is generally more realistic, mild-mannered, and sensible than his partner, Gloria, who is unashamed of the fact Jay is many years her senior. A recurring plot involves Jay's relationship with his son Mitchell, which became more complicated due to Jay's reaction to Mitchell's sexual orientation. Humor and plot points are also derived from Jay's relationship with his son-in-law Phil; Jay often mistreats and antagonizes him despite Phil's constant attempts to gain Jay's approval. Nevertheless, Jay thinks very highly of Phil, despite their differences, and said so in Season 3.\n\nEd O'Neill portrays Jay Pritchett, the father of three, husband of his second wife Gloria, and step-father of one\n\nJay has several masculine character attributes including fondness for sports and model airplanes. Jay is shown also to occasionally be compassionate, showing affection for members of the extended family particularly to Manny, his step-son; their relationship seems to become more positive as the series progresses, eventually becoming a typical father-son relationship. In the finale of the third season, it is revealed that Gloria is pregnant, but Jay does not know yet. In the first episode of the fourth season, Gloria tells Jay and he tells her that it's the greatest news he has heard. The baby was male, which relieved Jay because it says in the episode \"Snip\" that he was afraid of having a girl. Jay is a dog-lover. He sometimes goes overboard in treating his dog Stella as his favorite member of the family much to Gloria's chagrin, and Jay was extremely happy when he realized that Joe was not allergic to Stella, but to Gloria's face cream, in the episode \"Rash Decisions\". Jay is farsighted (hyperopia). Jay evidently served in the United States Navy during the Vietnam War. His birthday is April 1, as shown in the episode \"Grill, Interrupted\".\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nO'Neill was consecutively nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2011, 2012 and 2013. In 2011, he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series and Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.[18]\n\nGloria Pritchett [ edit ]\n\nGloria Pritchett First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Sof\u00eda Vergara Information Gender Female Occupation Hairdresser (formerly)\n\nTaxi driver (formerly)\n\nHousewife Family Fulgencio Ram\u00edrez (father; deceased)\n\nPilar Ram\u00edrez (mother)\n\nSonia Ram\u00edrez (sister)\n\n2 unnamed brothers Spouse Javier Delgado\n\n( m. 1995; div. 2006)\n\nJay Pritchett ( m. 2009) Children Manny Delgado (son)\n\nClaire Dunphy (step-daughter)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (step-son)\n\nJoe Pritchett (son) Religion Roman Catholic Nationality Colombian/American\n\nGloria Maria Ram\u00edrez-Pritchett (Sof\u00eda Vergara), formerly Delgado and n\u00e9e Ram\u00edrez, is Jay's second wife and mother to Manny and Joe. She is from Barranquilla, a city in Colombia (as is Sof\u00eda Vergara herself). She is a very loving wife and mother.[19] At first, the family (specifically Claire) does not accept her because of her age difference to Jay. In the episode \"Coal Digger\", Luke calls her a coal digger which is mocking when Claire called her a gold digger. The most frequent running gag involving the character is her mispronunciation of common English words and phrases, and Vergara confirmed that many of these mispronunciations are improvised.[20]\n\nSof\u00eda Vergara portrays Gloria Ram\u00edrez-Pritchett, wife of her second husband Jay, mother of two, and step-mother of two\n\nGloria often supports Manny when Jay tries to tell him to be less sensitive or hide his cultural background. However, she does occasionally display some odd parenting techniques. For example, when Manny was first born, she had wanted a daughter, and therefore for the first year of his life dressed him like one and told all her friends he was a girl. She later told Manny (after he found the pictures of himself like this) that the child in question was his \"twin sister who died at the age of one.\" In the sixth episode of Season One, she chastizes Jay for forcing Manny to remove his poncho for school. When they get to the school to return the poncho and realize that Manny has a plan to play folk music to his classmates with his pan flute (which was inside the poncho), Gloria tells Jay to break the flute, saying in her interview that \"the poncho by itself is fine. The poncho, plus the flute, plus the stupid dance? My son will die a virgin.\"\n\nGloria is a terrible driver, though she is oblivious to this. She is also very comfortable with death (on one occasion killing and beheading a rat with a shovel right before she left for church and leaving the head \"as a warning to the other rats\"), on account of a couple of her relatives being butchers.[19] She is an excellent markswoman, often just using one hand and never misses a shot, even saying to Manny that she could have unbuttoned his shirt if she wanted to with her gun (formerly Manny's BB gun). She has a very high tolerance for spicy food, and has perhaps the strongest religious views of any member of the family.[citation needed] She loves her family and spends a great deal of time with Lily because of her fixation in having a daughter. Mitchell and Cameron asked her and Jay to become guardians of Lily if anything were to happen to them.\n\nGloria has something of a shady past. Doubts have also been raised as to her income: her only mentioned employment was as a hairdresser (and later as a taxi driver), and Claire, Jay's daughter, originally labeled Gloria as a \"gold-digger\" for marrying her wealthy father. It seems likely that Jay is her major source of income. However, in the Season 5 episode \"A Hard Jay's Night\", the hairshop where she used to work is shown, and it is clarified that Jay is indeed her current major source of income. In the final episode of Season 3, it was revealed that she is pregnant. Her newest son Fulgencio a.k.a. Joe was born in the Season 4 episode \"Party Crasher\". In the episode \"Fifteen Percent\", she reveals that she comes from a neighborhood of prostitutes after she said her neighborhood had a saying that \"Love is just around the corner\". The Hispanic American character of Gloria was based on the character of Angela in the Jim Jarmusch film Night on Earth (1991), played by American actress Rosie Perez.[21] In season 6, Gloria officially became an American citizen.\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nSof\u00eda Vergara has been nominated four times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. In 2011, Vergara was nominated for the Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries, or Television Film and Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She was also nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series in 2011, 2012 and 2013.\n\nManny Delgado [ edit ]\n\nManny Delgado First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Rico Rodriguez Information Gender Male Occupation Student Family Javier Delgado (father)\n\nGloria Pritchett (mother)\n\nJay Pritchett (step-father)\n\nClaire Dunphy (step-sister)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (step-brother)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half-brother) Nationality Colombian-American\n\nManuel Alberto Javier \"Manny\" Delgado (Rico Rodriguez), Gloria's son from her first marriage to Javier, is very outgoing and not the least rather self-conscious,[22] although he has become somewhat self-conscious in Season 5. He is very intelligent, probably second after Alex, but much in a street smart way. He is also mature and intuitive for his age and is often shown doing adult-like things, such as having conversations with Claire about her marriage and kids, and drinking coffee. He even engaged in stock market business and briefly considered following in his biological father's footsteps by becoming a professional gambler.[22]\n\nManny has inherited his mother's passion for life (although he is terrified of butterflies), though Gloria has also said, \"Manny is passionate, just like his father.\"[19] This causes Manny to be very romantic.[22] Manny is not afraid to take chances, leading him to ask out older girls, and develops a crush on his step-niece Haley, to whom he gave flowers on \"Pilot\" and even kissed in \"Three Turkeys\".[22] He idolizes his absentee father, often speaking about him in a positive light, even after being repeatedly disappointed by his father's broken promises. He plays for a football team, fences, and is a skilled chess player. He is often seen wearing or intending to wear his \"burgundy dinner jacket.\" Manny was in the fifth grade in Season 1, the ninth grade in Season 5 and attends his first year of college in Season 9. Manny and his step-nephew Luke are good friends who each admire the strengths of the other although they spend a great deal of scheming against/fighting with each other as well.\n\nJoe Pritchett [ edit ]\n\nJoe Pritchett First appearance \"Party Crasher\"\n\n4x12, January 16, 2013 Portrayed by Rebecca and Sierra Mark (uncredited) (season 4)\n\nPierce Wallace (season 5\u20136)\n\nJeremy Maguire (season 7-present)[23] Information Gender Male Family Jay Pritchett (father)\n\nGloria Pritchett (mother)\n\nClaire Dunphy (half-sister)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (half-brother)\n\nManny Delgado (half-brother)\n\nFulgencio Joseph \"Joe\" Pritchett (Jeremy Maguire) is Gloria and Jay's son. Gloria discovered she was pregnant with him in the final episode of season 3, his existence was revealed to the rest of the cast in the first episode of season 4, and he was born in \"Party Crasher\". Joe's christening took place in \"Fulgencio\". In the Season 5 episode \"Spring-a-Ding-Fling\", he begins walking. In episode \"Larry's Wife\" Gloria calls over the priest believing that there is evil in Joe. The priest does a blessing on Joe but leaves when Joe pick-pocketed the priest's wallet. Gloria returns the wallet and apologizes. Later in the Season 5 episode \"And One to Grow On\", it is Joe's birthday and Jay wants to reuse birthday decorations from Manny's birthday party the day before but Gloria refuses. In episode \"Queer Eyes, Full Hearts\", Manny's Spanish teacher teaches Joe to swim.\n\nStella [ edit ]\n\nStella (Brigitte) is the French bulldog of the Pritchett family, introduced in \"Good Cop Bad Dog\" (season 2, episode 22). She was the dog of a man named Guillermo (Lin-Manuel Miranda), an inventor, but when Jay convinced him to abandon his idea and return to school, Guillermo gave Stella to the family. She is very problematic, and often destroys things, mostly Gloria's belongings. However, Jay has a great affection for her (letting her sleep in his bed and feeding her from the dinner table), which infuriates Gloria because Jay seems to pay more love and attention to the dog than his own wife.\n\nThe Tucker-Pritchett family [ edit ]\n\nMitchell Pritchett (Mitch) [ edit ]\n\nMitchell Pritchett First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Jesse Tyler Ferguson Information Gender Male Occupation Lawyer Family Jay Pritchett (father)\n\nDeDe Pritchett (mother; deceased)\n\nClaire Dunphy (sister)\n\nGloria Pritchett (step-mother)\n\nManny Delgado (step-brother)\n\nJoe Pritchett (half-brother) Spouse Cameron Tucker ( m. 2014) Children Lily Tucker-Pritchett\n\n(adoptive daughter)\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson portrays Mitchell Pritchett, Cameron's husband and father of one\n\nMitchell Vincent Pritchett (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), also referred to as Mitch, is Jay's son; Claire's younger brother, Gloria's step-son, Manny's step-brother, Joe's half-brother, Haley, Alex and Luke's uncle; one of Lily's fathers; and partner of eight years to Cameron.[24] In the season finale of the fifth season, he and Cam get married. He is a low-key, mild-mannered person, but has many sensitive qualities. At most times, he is the exact opposite of Cameron which usually causes disagreements. Cameron acts as a counterbalance to Mitchell's uptight, worrying ways. Because of his mild-mannered, uptight nature, he is sometimes embarrassed by Cameron's flamboyance. He is uncomfortable with public displays of affection, as well as invasion of his personal space. He is an overprotective and cautious father. He is shown to be a capable lawyer, even representing an entire building full of people one-by-one with no prior notice.[25] A recurring theme on the show is Mitchell's relationship with his father, which was strained by the revelation of Mitchell's homosexuality. Mitchell is a musical theater fan and enjoyed ice skating as a kid, though he later admitted that he liked working with his sister as a team more than the ice skating itself. Although he fancies himself as a handyman, everybody is afraid of him around tools. From his degrees hanging in his office, it is apparent that Mitchell attended undergrad at Cornell University and law school at Columbia University.\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nTV.com has named Mitchell and Cameron one of the \"Five Best TV Dads,\" saying, \"Cam and Mitchell adopted baby Lily from Vietnam way back in Modern Family's pilot episode, and have been inadvertently Americanizing her ever since.\"[26]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson has been nominated five times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nCameron Tucker (Cam) [ edit ]\n\nCameron Tucker First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Eric Stonestreet Information Gender Male Occupation Clown\n\nChristmas Caroler\n\nMusic teacher\n\nMiddle school music teacher\n\nHistory teacher\n\nHigh School Football Coach & Physical Education Teacher Family Merle Tucker (father)\n\nBarb Tucker (mother)\n\nPam Tucker (sister)\n\n2 unnamed siblings Spouse Mitchell Pritchett ( m. 2014) Children Lily Tucker-Pritchett\n\n(adoptive daughter) Nationality American\n\nCameron Scott \"Cam\" Tucker (Eric Stonestreet),[27] also referred to as Cam, is Mitchell's husband of eight years, and one of Lily's fathers, who has a very big dramatic personality. He frequently behaves like a drama queen. His bubbly outgoing personality contrasts to Mitchell's uptight manner, which causes them to have opposing character traits.[28] Cameron was born on February 29, 1972 and grew up on a farm in Missouri. He was a starting center for the University of Illinois football team (which he and Jay bond over, much to Mitchell's envy) and is a very big sports fan.[28] Because of this, he is physically quite imposing, and capable of scaring off anyone who threatens Mitchell. Cameron also fosters many unusual hobbies such as collecting antique fountain pens, being adept in Japanese flower arrangement, and is a classically trained Auguste clown named Fizbo.[28] Cameron prides himself in shooting home films, not movies, and takes that role very seriously. At the beginning of the series he acts as a stay-at-home dad to Lily, though it is mentioned that he had taught music prior to this. In the later seasons Cameron begins working as a football coach. Cameron is also an experienced rock drummer and as a result was brought in at the last minute to play in Dylan's band when they needed a replacement percussionist.\n\nIt is also mentioned that Cameron was considerably thinner and in better shape when he first started dating Mitchell. For the first few episodes, his relationship with Mitchell was somewhat strained (as they disagreed on almost everything and showed very different parenting techniques). But in more recent episodes the relationship is much happier.[28] Cameron and Mitchell met at one of Pepper Saltzman's \"legendary\" soirees, where during a game of charades, Cameron immediately knew the answer, \"Casablanca,\" based on a subtle gesture Mitchell made with his hands. Common interests, like art, led them to form a relationship. Mitchell is impressed by Cameron's quirks, such as speaking French (to which Cameron replies, \"un peu,\" or \"a little\"). Cameron is also said to be a huge fan of the movie The Wizard of Oz in the episode \"Leap Day\" when Mitchell plans him a surprise birthday party.[24]\n\nDuring season 4, Cameron goes back to work as a music teacher at Luke and Manny's school. In season 5, his music teacher job is eliminated, but he becomes the freshman football coach and physical education teacher. In season 6, he is promoted to varsity coach and his undefeated record and open homosexuality earned him a story on the local television news.\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nEric Stonestreet has received positive reviews for his characters. In a review of the first season, Robert Canning of IGN named Cameron Tucker the best character of the season saying, \"Cameron's many talents and passions revealed over the course of this first year became an ever-building running gag. But it will be hard to top the sheer joy that was 'Fizbo'.\" He also called Fizbo, the episode and the clown, the highlight of the season.[7] The reception of Cameron and Mitchell has led to the idea of a spin-off of the two titled Mitchell and Cam.[29]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nIn 2010, Eric Stonestreet was nominated for the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy.[30] Stonestreet has won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series twice in 2010 and 2012. He was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries, or Television Film in 2011, 2012 and 2013, along with receiving nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series in 2011, 2012 and 2013. In 2011, along with Ed O'Neill and Ty Burrell, Stonestreet was nominated for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett [ edit ]\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett First appearance \"Pilot\"\n\n1x01, September 23, 2009 Portrayed by Jaden Hiller and Ella Hiller\n\n(seasons 1\u20132)\n\nAubrey Anderson-Emmons\n\n(season 3\u2013present) Information Gender Female Occupation Student Family Mitchell Pritchett (adoptive father)\n\nCameron Tucker (adoptive father) Nationality Vietnamese-American\n\nLillian Elizabeth \"Lily\" Tucker-Pritchett (Jaden and Ella Hiller seasons 1 and 2; Aubrey Anderson-Emmons season 3 onwards) is the adoptive daughter of Cameron and Mitchell. She is named after the daughter of Charlotte from the HBO series Sex and the City, and Cam's pig \"Aunt Lily\". When she was introduced to the family, they accepted her with open arms, although Mitchell originally wanted to wait to tell them about her.[25] She is at times doing activities with both of her fathers but remains with Cam at home while Mitchell works.[28] During the show's early seasons, Cameron often dressed her up as famous people, such as Diana Ross, Olivia Newton-John, Madonna and Stevie Wonder for the purpose of taking photographs. Cameron and Mitchell practiced the Ferber method on Lily when she was a baby, but Cameron usually couldn't resist catering to her during the night, sometimes even watching movies such as Scarface, which Cam claims she likes possibly because of the bright colors, particularly the club shooting scene.\n\nLily did not speak for the first two seasons and was portrayed by twins Ella Hiller and Jaden Hiller. For season three, the twins \"retired\", their mother claiming they did not enjoy acting.[31] The role was recast to Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who is older, and has a speaking role. Since she has been able to speak, Lily has displayed a penchant for precocious sarcasm and theatricality, which can be attributed to the influence from each of her fathers. Lily was born February 19, 2008.\n\nLarry [ edit ]\n\nLarry is the pet cat of Lily, Cameron and Mitchell. They adopt him in \"Bringing Up Baby\" (season 4, episode 1) after Cameron and Mitchell failed to adopt a second child.\n\nOther family members [ edit ]\n\nOverview [ edit ]\n\nDeDe Pritchett [ edit ]\n\nDeDe Pritchett First appearance \"The Incident\"\n\n1x04, October 14, 2009 Last appearance \"Good Grief\"\n\n10x05, October 24, 2018 Portrayed by Shelley Long Information Gender Female Family Lucas Williams (father; deceased)\n\nMrs. Williams (mother; deceased)\n\nBeBe Williams (sister)\n\nCeCe Williams (sister) Spouse Jay Pritchett (1968\u20132003) Significant other Chaz\n\nRobbie Sullivan\n\nCarl Children Claire Dunphy (daughter)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (son) Relatives Phil Dunphy (son-in-law)\n\nCameron Tucker (son-in-law)\n\nHaley Marshall (granddaughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (grandson)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive granddaughter)\n\nMr. Pritchett (ex-father-in-law; deceased)\n\nMrs. Pritchett (ex-mother-in-law; deceased)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (ex-brother-in-law)\n\nBecky Pritchett (ex-sister-in-law)\n\nIrene Pritchett (ex-sister-in-law)\n\nMichael Pritchett (ex-nephew by marriage)\n\nMelanie Pritchett (ex-great-niece by marriage)\n\nDeDe Pritchett (Shelley Long) was Claire and Mitchell's mother, Haley, Alex and Luke's maternal grandmother, Lily's adoptive grandmother, Phil and Cam's mother-in-law and Jay's ex-wife. It had been implied that she may be mentally ill due to her somewhat manipulative and sometimes aggressive ways. It is implied that she was initially more accepting of Mitchell's sexual orientation than Jay was when he first came out. She often uses her close relationship with Mitchell to get him to do things he does not want to do. Jay wanted to divorce her after a spectacular fight they had while their kids were still in school (he taped over an episode of Dallas to record an NFL game that, ironically, featured the Dallas Cowboys) but was inspired by an animatronic Abraham Lincoln exhibit at Disneyland to stick things out until Claire and Mitchell reached adulthood. She is still bitter over Jay's remarriage to Gloria and even attempted to ruin their wedding, which she convinced Mitchell to talk Jay and Gloria into inviting her to; she got drunk and made rude and inappropriate toasts and eventually had to be dragged out of the reception, in the process ruining the wedding cake. She is very aggressive towards Gloria, often trying to physically attack her. DeDe is also passive aggressive toward Cameron about his weight, and is often critical of Claire, especially her appearance. She also seems to be very good friends with Manny as they write letters to each other talking about their personal issues. DeDe is also a famous author and poet. A running gag throughout the series is that DeDe's arrival is always forewarned by bad omens, (birds crashing into the window or peaceful scenarios spontaneously turning chaotic).\n\nHer relationship with Gloria improved in the episode \"Arrested.\" When DeDe sees that Gloria is pregnant, she finds it hilarious that Jay's marriage to a much younger trophy wife has forced him to raise a child in his 60s. She found new sympathy for Gloria, and the two bonded over Jay-bashing when DeDe tells Gloria that she was always the one having to change diapers, clean spit-up, and buy things for the baby. Gloria, in turn, found new sympathy for DeDe, suggesting that her lack of support from Jay was what caused her to become \"so crazy\".\n\nIn the season 10 episode, \"Good Grief\", DeDe was revealed to have passed away peacefully in her sleep, while on a trip with her women's group.[32]\n\nFrank Dunphy [ edit ]\n\nFrank Dunphy First appearance \"Undeck the Halls\"\n\n1x10, December 9, 2009 Portrayed by Fred Willard Information Gender Male Spouse Grace Dunphy ( d. 2013)\n\nLorraine Dunphy ( m. 2017) Children Phil Dunphy (son)\n\nRay (step-son) Relatives Claire Dunphy (daughter-in-law)\n\nHaley Marshall (granddaughter)\n\nAlex Dunphy (granddaughter)\n\nLuke Dunphy (grandson)\n\nFrancis Allen \"Frank\" Dunphy (Fred Willard) is Phil's father and Haley, Alex, and Luke's paternal grandfather. On Christmas, the family shared a webcam chat with him.\n\nFrank returns in \"Travels with Scout\" when he travels cross country without Phil's mother and shows up with a dog that he says she has allergies to. He ends up taking the dog back with him.[33][34] Frank is kind of a polar opposite of Jay's (Claire's father) grumpiness and dry manner, as he is seen being laid back, funny and cool most of the time. This is clearly mentioned by Claire in \"Closet, You'll Love it !\" when most family members refer to Jay as 'Grump-pa' while Frank is referred to as 'Fun-pa'. His attitude is a near carbon copy of Phil's personality. At the end of season 4, it is revealed that Frank's wife (Phil's mother) had died. In season 8, Frank starts dating Lorraine, Phil's childhood babysitter and crush. Later, he proposes to her and in episode 19, they get married.\n\nIn 2010, Willard was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nJavier Delgado [ edit ]\n\nJavier Delgado First appearance \"Up All Night\"\n\n1x11, January 6, 2010 Portrayed by Benjamin Bratt Information Gender Male Spouse Gloria Delgado-Pritchett\n\n( m. 1995; div. 2006) Significant other Trish (fianc\u00e9e) Children Manny Delgado (son) Nationality Colombian\n\nJavier Delgado (Benjamin Bratt) is Manny's biological father and Gloria's ex-husband. He and Gloria were divorced; in the pilot, Gloria says all they did was \"fight and make love,\" at one point leading them to fall out of a window. Manny looks up to him, but Javier always lets him down, while Jay is left downcast by the reminders that Manny has another dad. He is oddly gifted when it comes to betting on horse racing. In the episode \"Flip Flop,\" he has a girlfriend named Trish (Paget Brewster) and almost marries her.\n\nJavier was formerly a Triple-A baseball player and played alongside such baseball greats as Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire. He has many connections to matadors and baseball players. He and Jay became close, but in the end Javier lets Jay down just as he does Manny.[35]\n\nBarb Tucker [ edit ]\n\nBarb Tucker First appearance \"Mother Tucker\"\n\n2x09, November 24, 2010 Portrayed by Celia Weston Information Gender Female Family unnamed mother (deceased) Spouse Merle Tucker Children Cameron Tucker (son)\n\nPam Tucker (daughter)\n\n2 other unnamed children\n\nBarb Tucker (Celia Weston) is Cameron's mother. She first appeared in the episode \"Mother Tucker\". In that episode, she visits Cameron and Mitchell. While Cameron earnestly declares that his mother is wonderful, Mitchell is less sure because she has a habit of touching Mitchell inappropriately. When Mitchell finally tells Cameron about this, Barb happens to walk in on them and hears his complaints. Later, she apologizes to Mitchell. Unfortunately, she does this while he is in the bathtub. In \"The Wedding\", she attends her son's wedding to Mitchell and almost ends it with Merle, but Jay and Gloria manage to reconcile the two.\n\nDonnie Pritchett [ edit ]\n\nDonnie Pritchett First appearance \"The Musical Man\"\n\n2x19, April 13, 2011 Portrayed by Jonathan Banks Information Gender Male Family Mr. Pritchett (father; deceased)\n\nMrs. Pritchett (mother; deceased)\n\nJay Pritchett (brother)\n\nBecky Pritchett (sister) Spouse Irene Pritchett Children Michael Pritchett (son)\n\nPossibly more children Relatives Melanie Pritchett (granddaughter)\n\nPossibly more grandchildren\n\nClaire Dunphy (niece)\n\nMitchell Pritchett (nephew)\n\nJoe Pritchett (nephew)\n\nHaley Marshall (great-niece)\n\nAlex Dunphy (great-niece)\n\nLuke Dunphy (great-nephew)\n\nLily Tucker-Pritchett (adoptive great-niece)\n\nPhil Dunphy (nephew-in-law)\n\nCameron Tucker (nephew-in-law)\n\nGloria Pritchett (sister-in-law)\n\nDeDe Pritchett (ex-sister-in-law)\n\nManny Delgado (step-nephew)\n\nDonnie Pritchett (Jonathan Banks) is Jay's brother.

In \"Farm Strong\", she comes for a visit from the farm and Mitchell and Cameron are afraid to tell her that they are getting married because they do not want to hurt her feelings of her still being single and because Cameron claims that Pam is very sensitive. Lily is the one who finally tells her. Pam seems extremely happy with the news and shares her own news with them; she is engaged to Cameron's first crush, Bo Johnson. Cameron gets really upset hearing that and Pam tells him that no one in the family wanted to tell him because he is too sensitive and they were protecting him, something that contradicts Cameron's earlier assertion and makes Cameron even more upset. When the whole family gathers at Jay and Gloria's house, Cameron wants to prove that he is not that sensitive as Pam accuses him to be and asks everyone to tell him things they were hiding from him because they were trying to protect him. Everyone says their part and Cameron, as much as he tries not to break down in tears, after hearing Lily admitting that she pretends to fall asleep when he reads to her so he can leave her alone, breaks down in tears and finishes locking himself in the bathroom. Mitchell and Pam go to comfort him, and Pam tells him that he may have difficulty with bad news, but everyone always wants to share good news with him because he would always appreciate it.\n\nIn \"The Wedding\", she has small cameos at Mitchell and Cameron's wedding.\n\nIn \"Frank's wedding\", she comes to visit and auditions for a modeling job.

He is often put into awkward situations by Phil, who wishes for the two to be friends.[12] He has diverse interests that are often surprising, such as his love of old western films. He also sometimes reveals a sort-of attraction to Claire, when he gives her a rose on Valentine's Day, saying that \"every mom should look as tasty as you when they're old.\" He also had a dream involving a (suggested) sexual encounter involving himself, Haley and Claire. Claire strongly dislikes him, to the point of trying to introduce other boys to Haley just so that they break up or don't get back together. He loves the confidence Haley gets from being part of such a loving family and does not mind hanging around during family get togethers.[12] He wrote a song for Haley, \"In the Moonlight (Do Me)\", and performed it for her extended family. The song was about sex and most of the family were surprised by the suggestive lyrics, but it became stuck in all of their heads the next day. He is also a hockey player and finds inspiration for his music from Bob Dylan, Sum 41, Blink-182 and New Kids on the Block.\n\nDylan temporarily leaves the cast to work on a ranch after Haley rejects his marriage proposal in the first episode of season three, \"Dude Ranch\". In the episode \"Virgin Territory\", Alex reveals that Haley had lost her virginity to Dylan before they broke up; she told Claire three months earlier, but not Phil. In the episode \"Disneyland,\" Dylan reveals he lost his job on the ranch and moved back to California, taking a job at Disneyland as a Dapper Dan. He and Haley get back together to Claire's dismay and to Phil's delight. In the season finale, \"Baby on Board\", Haley discovers she was accepted to college. She and Dylan maintain their relationship, and Dylan lives with the Dunphys for a few months. In Season 4, Dylan is invited to move in with Cam and Mitch after his work as a limo driver led him to their Valentine's Day party (some of their friends invited Dylan to stay for the party, and Cam offered him at some point to stay at their house), but he ends up getting fired and, while Cam and Mitch separately tell him he can stick around, Lily angrily tells him he isn't welcome there and shouts at him until he leaves the house. In Season 8, he gets married to a doctor named Elaine Kolchek and has three step-kids much to Haley's dismay as she feels she lost her \"romantic safety net\". Now Since \"Can't Elope\" on April 10, 2019 and he's finally married to Miss Haley Dunphy as now Mrs. Haley Marshall and on May 8 the family delivered twins, a boy and a girl who are unnamed as of now.\n\nOther characters [ edit ]\n\nIntroduced in season 1 [ edit ]\n\nSal [ edit ]\n\nSal First appearance \"Great Expectations\"\n\n1x08, November 18, 2009 Portrayed by Elizabeth Banks Information Gender Female Family Tony (ex-husband)\n\nSammy (son) Significant other Eddie (boyfriend)\n\nSal (Elizabeth Banks) is Mitch and Cameron's wild, partying, boozy friend from their younger years in the 1990s.

In the episode \"Best Men\", she gets married and enlists Cam and Mitch to be the best men at the wedding. However, in the episode, \"The Wedding (Part 1)\", she tells them that she got divorced and she is obviously pregnant. Sal had declared herself the officiator of the wedding while Cam and Mitch were trying to have intervention about her drinking. In \"The Wedding (Part 2)\", Sal's water breaks in the middle of the (first) ceremony. She convinces her new boyfriend of four months (who believes he is the father) that when a baby comes so early, sometimes it is black.\n\nIt eventually transpires (in \"Fight or Flight\") that Sal's baby is white and she is raising the baby alone, having presumably split from the man she was seeing at the time of Mitch and Cameron's wedding. When Mitch, Cam, Pepper and friends throw her a baby shower, she is seen to be far more mature and responsible, due to the birth of her baby, despite everyone fearing the worst when she disappears in the middle of the party.\n\nIntroduced in season 2 [ edit ]\n\nPepper Saltzman [ edit ]\n\nPepper Saltzman First appearance \"Earthquake\"\n\n2x03, October 6, 2010 Portrayed by Nathan Lane Information Gender Male Occupation Wedding planner Family Chaim Saltzman (father)\n\nKyle Saltzman (son)\n\nSherman \"Pepper\" Saltzman (Nathan Lane) is one of Mitchell and Cameron's friends.

Since an earthquake happened, they say that Mitch has a sprained ankle and that stuff is broken all over the house as an excuse.
