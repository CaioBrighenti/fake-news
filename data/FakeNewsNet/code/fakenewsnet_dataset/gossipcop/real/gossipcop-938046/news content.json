They recently attended the 3rd Annual Vanderpump Dog Foundation Gala and also appeared on a recent episode of Flipping Out, and they revealed that Kent is in charge of the wedding plans, but they have a long way to go.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even started looking at dresses. We haven\u2019t even set a date, so we\u2019re just enjoying it, very slowly,\u201d said Kent.\n\nShe told US Weekly in a recent interview that you never know which way she will go when it comes to her wedding gown. She says she could go classic or gangster, or maybe even gangster-chic. But, she says that she is the worst bride-to-be ever because she hasn\u2019t done anything regarding the wedding except for liking different wedding dress styles on Instagram.\n\nThe only other wedding detail that Kent has thought about is the date, and she says they are shooting for a 2020 wedding.\n\nEmmett did make it clear that Kent is the boss. He said that he is \u201cstaying out of it,\u201d and Kent is running the show. All he needs is the date and time, and he will be there. Kent noted that Emmett is in control of one aspect \u2013 setting the budget.\n\nKent kept her relationship with Emmett a secret for two years, but she finally confirmed they were together on New Year\u2019s Eve last year. She says it was \u201ckind of fun for a while\u201d to keep their romance on the down-low.\n\nEmmett has not made an appearance on Vanderpump Rules, but he joined Kent on Flipping Out when Jeff Lewis helped with his home remodel. Lewis said that another one of his clients, Saved By The Bell star Mark-Paul Gosselaar, lives across the street from Emmett and introduced the two.\n\nLewis hadn\u2019t met Kent before taping, but the two definitely hit it off. Kent said that she and Lewis were \u201cin sync\u201d with their design choices, and you have to work with someone who shares your ideas and aesthetic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo see more of Lala Kent and her co-stars \u2013 and perhaps even an appearance by Emmett \u2013 watch Vanderpump Rules, Monday nights on Bravo.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toni-Braxton-300x169.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bilie-lee-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Vanderpump-Rules-Star-LaLa-Kent-Talks-Wedding-Plans-With-Randall-Emmett.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-RHOA-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Teen-Mom-Maci-Bookout-Pregnant-With-Baby-No-4-Fans-Spot-A-Baby-Bump-After-Months-Of-Speculation-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Bilie-lee-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pauley-Perrette-Mark-Harmon-NCIS-300x195.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Kandi-Burruss-300x233.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jax-T-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-Donald-Trump-Nancy-Pelosi-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/tom-katie-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Vanderpump-Rules-Star-LaLa-Kent-Talks-Wedding-Plans-With-Randall-Emmett.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/vanderpump-rules-star-lala-kent-talks-wedding-plans-with-randall-emmett-221804/", "title": "\u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 Star Lala Kent Talks Wedding Plans With Randall Emmett", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "lala kent, Randall Emmett, vanderpump rules,", "keywords": "celebrity news, lala kent, Randall Emmett, vanderpump rules,", "description": "Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent got engaged to Randall Emmett in September at the Esperanza an Auberge Resort in Cabo San Lucas, but the couple is in", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 Star Lala Kent Talks Wedding Plans With Randall Emmett", "description": "Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent got engaged to Randall Emmett in September at the Esperanza an Auberge Resort in Cabo San Lucas, but the couple is in", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/vanderpump-rules-star-lala-kent-talks-wedding-plans-with-randall-emmett-221804/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Vanderpump-Rules-Star-LaLa-Kent-Talks-Wedding-Plans-With-Randall-Emmett.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-12-06", "modified_time": "2018-12-06", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/suzykerr/", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "vanderpump rules"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544072400.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
