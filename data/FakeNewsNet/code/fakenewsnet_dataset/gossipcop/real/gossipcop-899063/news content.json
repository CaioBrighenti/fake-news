The rapper wears a full-body, high-neck custom latex catsuit by Vex Clothing underneath a mirrored corset, finishing off the look with pink braids that extend to the very bottom of her translucent PVC thigh-high heeled boots. In fact, this could be her most radical take on the Barbie trope yet.", "images": ["https://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/pass/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/pass/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Hahn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/migos-cardi-b-motorsport-music-video-moto-cross-latex-bodysuit-pink-braids", "title": "Nicki Minaj Is a Futuristic Barbie in Migos\u2019s Neon Bright Video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/migos-cardi-b-motorsport-music-video-moto-cross-latex-bodysuit-pink-braids", "title": "Nicki Minaj Is a Futuristic Barbie in Migos\u2019s Neon Bright Video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d", "description": "While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/pass/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "Nicki Minaj Is a Futuristic Barbie in Migos\u2019s Neon Bright Video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d - Vogue", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/pass/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=https://www.vogue.com/article/migos-cardi-b-motorsport-music-video-moto-cross-latex-bodysuit-pink-braids, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "description": "While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.", "keywords": "Fashion,Music Videos,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Fashion,Music Videos,mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Fashion", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/9v_rtaye2yY"], "publish_date": 1512773815.606, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
