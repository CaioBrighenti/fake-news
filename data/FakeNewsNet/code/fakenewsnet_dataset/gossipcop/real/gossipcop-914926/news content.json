Rodriguez/Getty\n\nActress Camila Mendes opened up about her eating disorder in Marie Claire Malaysia's June 2018 issue.\n\nShe discussed the societal assumption that thin is beautiful \u2014 and how that view has evolved over time.\n\nMendes is working through Project Heal to raise awareness of eating disorders and the costs to get treatment.\n\nCamila Mendes got candid about her experience with an eating disorder in a raw new interview. The \"Riverdale\" actress is on Marie Claire Malaysia's June 2018 cover, and she took the opportunity to shed some light on harmful societal beauty standards, her own eating disorder, and her important work with Project Heal.\n\n\"When I grew up, I was obsessed with being thin,\" the actor told the outlet, \"and then I went to college, I noticed my body was changing and it made me feel out of control but I didn't understand it. I thought I was just gaining a lot of weight \u2026 at that time there weren't many voices out there that championed curvier body types.\"\n\nMendes went on to contrast her experience in college with today's slowly evolving beauty standards, which helped her to accept her own body.\n\n\"Now, we see models like Ashley Graham who are encouraging women to embrace being unique,\" she continued, \"and that made me let go of the standard that was established so long ago \u2014 that thin is the only type of beautiful.\"\n\nFurthermore, due to her \u2014 and many peoples' \u2014 assumption that only super thin people experience eating disorders, Mendes never thought she had one: \"People don't know that you don't necessarily have to look like you have an eating disorder to have one,\" she said. \"And because I was never that skinny, I never thought that I did.\"\n\nMendes is now working with Project Heal, an organization that works to provide funding and resources to those who struggle with eating disorders. It's a cause that is close to her heart \u2014 both due to her own experiences and due to her sister's struggles.\n\n\"Growing up, my sister had a very serious eating disorder, and was in rehab for awhile,\" she continued. \"I think the biggest message through Project Heal is to let the public know just how high the costs really are to get treatment, and how an eating disorder is not recognized as a mental illness when in fact, it is one of the deadliest mental illnesses there is.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Mendes has opened up about her eating disorder: In February, the actress took to Instagram to share the struggle of being in recovery while working in the entertainment industry and \"playing Veronica, who adores her tight mini skirts.\" She and \"Riverdale\" co-star Lili Reinhart also slammed Cosmopolitan Philippines earlier this year for allegedly Photoshopping their waists.\n\n\"I'm not interested in having a slimmer waist,\" Mendes wrote at the time. \"I'm more than satisfied with the one I already have.\"\n\nIf you or someone you love is suffering from an eating disorder, whether it has been triggered by a restrictive diet or not, call the National Eating Disorders hotline at 1-800-931-2237.\n\nSign up hereto get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["https://amp.insider.com/images/5a7b331c3a5dcec1008b465c-750-563.jpg", "https://amp.insider.com/images/5b16eb9c5e48ec4c008b4596-640-320.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.insider.com/images/5b16eb9c5e48ec4c008b4596-640-320.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Molly Thomson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/camila-mendes-eating-disorder-misonceptions-2018-6", "title": "'Riverdale' star Camila Mendes says she didn't think she had an eating disorder because she was 'never that skinny'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.insider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#111111", "date": "2018-06-05", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-05", "news_keywords": "Camila Mendes, Riverdale, Eating disorders, Health, Freelancer, Molly Thomson", "sailthru.tags": "Camila Mendes, Riverdale, Eating disorders, Health, Freelancer, Molly Thomson", "description": "Camila Mendes got real about her experiences with an eating disorder.
