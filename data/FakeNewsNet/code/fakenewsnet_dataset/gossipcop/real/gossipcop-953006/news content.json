She\u2019ll leave both at the end of August for a new role at ABC focused on reporting and breaking news.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with some of the most brilliant minds on camera and off camera,\u201d says Faris who says her decision to switch roles was for both professional and personal reasons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to get my life back,\u201d she says. \u201cI have three kids (Caroline Grace, 10, JJ, 8, and Landon, 4,) and working at GMA Weekend and The View has been awesome, but I\u2019m so excited to not go to bed at 8:30 or 9 p.m. on a Friday or Saturday night because my alarm would go off for work at 3:30 a.m. every Saturday and Sunday morning.\u201d\n\nFaris adds that after going through a \u201crough year health-wise\u201d she knew it was time to make a change.\n\n\u201cWhat kicked it off is that I had a really tough miscarriage,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like it was in that moment that really repositioned my priority compass and our family\u2019s priority compass. I realized that my kids need me in the stands and on the sidelines, my husband and I need that time to reconnect.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Nicole Kidman Opens Up About the \u2018Massive Grief\u2019 She Felt After Suffering a Miscarriage\n\nWhile the job change will allow for more family time, Faris is also working on a new project.\n\n\u201cABC has really rallied behind a passion project of mine, which is to launch a faith podcast,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a woman of deep faith and Christian, so I\u2019m really excited to launch this podcast in September. We\u2019ll be taking to people of all faiths and how their faith has shaped the direction of their life.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gayle-king-main.jpg",
