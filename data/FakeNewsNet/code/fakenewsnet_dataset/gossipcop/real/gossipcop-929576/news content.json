The 44-year-old actor has two daughters and believes that being a dad is \u201cthe greatest blessing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI realized being a father is the greatest job I have ever had and the greatest job I will ever have,\u201d he said on \u201cOprah\u2019s Master Class\u201d in 2015, before his second daughter was born.\n\n\u201cThroughout the years, throughout the ups and downs, I\u2019ve realized that the most important thing that I could do with my daughter is lead our life with love,\u201d he said. \u201cNot success, not fame, not anything else but, \u2018I\u2019m always here for you. I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Rock had his first daughter, 15-year-old Simone, during his first marriage to Dany Garcia. He then welcomed his second daughter, one-year-old Jasmine, in December 2015 with his longtime partner Lauren Hashian.\n\nSince having kids, Johnson has proven time and again that he is the sweetest dad.
