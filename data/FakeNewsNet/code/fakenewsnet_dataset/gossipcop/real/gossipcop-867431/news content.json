However, she and Packer called off their engagement two months before the series launched. (Shortly after the series launched, Carey also had a well publicized lip sync mishap on ABC's New Year's Rockin' Eve.)\n\nThe eight-episode first season launched in December to 2.2 million viewers. However, viewership consistently dipped and the season finale drew just 510,000 viewers.\n\nMariah's World hailed from longtime E! collaborate Bunim/Murray Productions, which also produces the network's long-running hit Keeping Up With the Kardashians and its many spinoffs.\n\nMariah's World also marked Carey's first major TV commitment since she served as a judge on American Idol in season 12, which she called an \"abusive\" experience while promoting Mariah's World.\n\nIn addition to the Kardashians' empire, E!'s unscripted slate includes the WAGS franchise, Botched, Hollywood Medium, Famously Single, Eric and Jesse, Total Bellas and Total Divas, Second Wives Club and What Happens at the Abbey.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2019/01/dick_wolf_chuck_lorre_kenya_barris_amy_poehler_greg_berlanti__split_0.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/scale_crop_768_433/2017/07/gettyimages-645978852_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/11/this_is_us_ncis_empire_supergirl_modern_family_split.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/07/gettyimages-645978852_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2019/05/oitnb_s7_production_still_2-h_2019.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/07/gettyimages-645978852_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Stanhope", "Kate.Stanhope Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mariahs-world-not-returning-season-2-1040616", "title": "Mariah Carey's E!
