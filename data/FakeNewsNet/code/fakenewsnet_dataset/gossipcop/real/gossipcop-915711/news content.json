Getting Married\n\nKendra, who met the former Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver in 2008, admitted that she and Hank were dating during an interview with Chelsea Handler on Chelsea Lately, and about a month later, news broke that the couple was engaged. \u201c[She] has met someone who she would like to spend the rest of her life with,\u201d Kendra\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Hugh Hefner, said in a statement at the time. \u201cI have given her my blessing and will be giving her away at a very special wedding ceremony at the Playboy Mansion this coming June.\u201d Image zoom Kendra Wilkinson Baskett/Instagram After seven months of planning, the engaged couple announced in June 2009 that they would be expecting their first child together in December. \u201cI want her to enjoy this wedding because if she\u2019s happy, I\u2019m happy. That\u2019s all that matters,\u201d the former NFL star told PEOPLE about helping Kendra balance pregnancy and wedding planning. Later that month, the former Playmate married Hank at her onetime residence, the Playboy Mansion, in Los Angeles. Becoming Parents Six months after tying the knot, Kendra and Hank welcomed their son. \u201cWe\u2019ve already decided to name our son Hank Baskett IV,\u201d she previously said. \u201cHank\u2019s dad and his grandfather were both named Hank, so it was very important to us to carry on the family tradition.\u201d After giving birth, Kendra opened up about her battle with postpartum depression. Image zoom Kendra Wilkinson/Instagram \u201cIt got pretty bad, [but] not to the point where I would harm my family,\u201d she told PEOPLE in 2011. \u201cI was a great mom and did what I needed to, but I was definitely very depressed. [Motherhood is] a big change in life and it happened overnight.\u201d \u201cYour baby is no. 1 100 percent of the time, but I do still take me time \u2014 you need to do that every now and then,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m back to being that Kendra that everyone knew at the Playboy Mansion, but a lot more mature and grown up. I\u2019m more aware of life.\u201d In 2013, the couple had a second baby on their minds. \u201cRight now, we found the key to happiness. We have the key to marriage, we have the key to parenting, why not right now bring a new life into this world while we\u2019re this happy? It just makes sense,\u201d she previously told PEOPLE. Marriage Rocked By Scandal In 2011, the duo decided to embark on a new adventure together in the reality TV world. Starring in WE tv\u2019s Kendra On Top, the duo shared their deepest secrets and relationship woes with viewers for eight seasons. Three years later in 2014, news broke that Hank had an affair with a transgender model while Kendra was eight months pregnant with their second child, daughter Alijah. \u201cI messed up,\u201d Hank previously told PEOPLE. \u201cI put myself in a bad situation. And everything through me brought pain upon this family.\u201d Image zoom WE tv \u201cI was this big former football player,\u201d he added. \u201cI was the alpha male. I could do anything to protect my family but I couldn\u2019t protect myself.\u201d After the media frenzy and just five weeks after their daughter\u2019s birth, Kendra \u201cwent ballistic,\u201d she said, kicking Hank out, flushing her wedding rings down the toilet and threatening divorce. \u201cI couldn\u2019t control my emotions.\u201d However, once Hank came clean and displayed honesty, Kendra stood by him. \u201cI don\u2019t say the word \u2018cheat.\u2019 I can say he was not loyal to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the act. I care about how he reacted to it and how I was told by the media what happened. That scarred me.\u201d Finding Trust Again\n\nThe couple, who has been open about their experience with couples therapy, participated in a season of WE tv\u2019s Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars, and viewers watched as the couple just couldn\u2019t seem to put their past behind them.\n\nDespite their relationship strife, they were committed to fighting for each other, their marriage and their family. Image zoom Kendra Wilkinson Baskett/Instagram \u201cHe loves me, and we\u2019re going to be together for the rest of our lives. We\u2019ll prove it \u2026 until we\u2019re 100 years old. We\u2019re gonna be together forever,\u201d she said during an appearance on Access Hollywood Live in November 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finding the trust again,\u201d she told PEOPLE in 2015. \u201cAnd I\u2019m actually very happy Hank went through this now because he\u2019s able to teach his son and his daughter what it\u2019s like to make a mistake and what you do after making a mistake.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kendra Wilkinson & Hank Baskett Are Preparing to Separate: \u2018She Realized There\u2019s No Turning Back\u2019\n\nA Step Forward\n\nDuring an explosive fight on a 2015 episode of Kendra On Top, Kendra asked Hank, \u201cHow do you think it makes me feel to be told repeatedly that you don\u2019t want to be married anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here doing everything I can to pick up the pieces and fight for our marriage,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s ever good enough.\u201d\n\nBut in 2016, the couple revealed that their marriage was better than ever.\n\n\u201cWe poke fun at each other all the time now. Before it was so serious,\u201d Kendra said. \u201cThe drama that we went through just shook us up. It ate us up and spit us out new people. I\u2019m so thankful we both held on.\u201d\n\nAnd in March 2017, the couple celebrated their 9-year anniversary of when they first met.\n\n\u201c9 years ago I met the person who would take me all the way to the top and hold me there even during the weakest times. We met that day out on the golf course and knew he was mine. Even with little bump in the road, nothing or nobody can be greater or make me feel more successful than @hank_baskett,\u201d Kendra wrote in a sweet Instagram post. \u201cImperfection is where great change and growth happens with us. We are true best friends who f\u2014 good, fight good, golf good, BBQ and drink beer good. Thank you Hank for being there on the golf course that day and being that shy guy. Thank u for my happiness and our children\u2026 here\u2019s to eternity.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Ari Perilstein/Getty\n\nHank expressed his gratitude on social media as well. \u201cIn life you\u2019re told to go with your gut. Well, 9 years ago I did just that. This day is special to me not because it\u2019s my Pops birthday but it\u2019s also the day this picture was taken, the day I met @kendra_wilkinson_baskett. I wasn\u2019t going to attend the Playboy golf tournament because they said I couldn\u2019t have Pops out to play with me and for his birthday I told him we were going to play golf,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen I told him where I might be instead he looked at me like I was crazy and said \u2018Boy, you better take your butt to LA!\u2019 Not because of Playboy but because I was going to golf on a nice course. We had no idea that trip would change my life. I sit here 8 years later having it all, and by all I mean my family. Kendra, Lil Hank and Alijah. Had I skipped the tournament as planned who knows where I\u2019d be,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLuckily a wise man told me to go play golf. Instead of just a day of golf I found a lifetime of love! Things happen for a reason and I\u2019m eternally grateful they did that day! I love you bayba!!\u201d\n\nMore Marital Problems\n\n\n\nLast month, Kendra admitted that the duo was \u201chaving issues\u201d and denied that their \u201cmarital problems\u201d are made up for cameras.\n\n\u201c1. how do u fake marital problems? makes absolutely no sense,\u201d Kendra began an Instagram post, which accompanied a screenshot of an article titled, \u201cMade-Up Marriage Problems?! Kendra\u2019s Faking It for TV.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Isaac Brekken/Getty\n\n\u201c2. Yes we are having issues,\u201d she continued. \u201c3. My job has been reality tv for 13 years 4. My show was a comedy and light hearted til sad times happened then we had to change my show from comedy to drama. Not what i wanted but was a part of my journey and story.\u201d\n\nIn a fifth point, Kendra shared that \u201cthese issues Hank n I are having in our home which we are tryin to hard to over come, everyone knows about, including producers and network, friends and family.\u201d\n\n\u201c6. My job is reality TV and I love my job unfortunately these issues at home are affecting my decisions cuz the last thing i want to do is hurt Hank,\u201d she shared. \u201c7. I hope to get back to the fun Kendra you all know. That\u2019s all i want n aim for. I hate drama!!!\u201d\n\nShe concluded by thanking fans for their \u201csupport and understanding me at this time. I\u2019ve been in a lot of therapy lately n hope all gets resolved for me, Hank,kids and even for TV. Lol \ud83d\ude02.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kendra\u2019s Ultimatum! Wilkinson Threatens to Cut Mom Off From Her Kids Over Expos\u00e9: \u2018There\u2019s No Coming Back\u2019\n\nDiffering Parenting Styles\n\n\n\nOn top of fighting through their relationship battles, the duo has been struggling to connect when it comes to their parenting techniques.\n\n\u201cThey love each other and the family dynamic they\u2019ve built together but just aren\u2019t on the same page when it comes to parenting styles,\u201d a source close to Kendra told PEOPLE.\n\nImage zoom Ari Perilstein/Getty\n\n\u201cHank is definitely more of the disciplinarian, but they\u2019ve been trying to work together. Kendra has always been focused on her career \u2013 but loves her kids. It\u2019s a tough balancing act for her as with any working mom. She spent half of 2017 performing her play in Las Vegas but would fly home as much as she could. Hank would take the kids to see her often too,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cThey love each other very much and will always support one another,\u201d the insider added. \u201cHank is such a blessing \u2014 he\u2019s a great father. He\u2019s always helping out and is very hands on.\u201d\n\nGoing Their Separate Ways\n\nAfter nearly nine years of marriage, Kendra confirmed on April 6 that the pair has decided to split.\n\n\u201cToday is the last day of my marriage to this beautiful man. I will forever love Hank and be open but for now we have chosen to go our own ways,\u201d she captioned a photo of herself and Hank.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beyond sad and heartbroken because i did believe in forever, that\u2019s why i said yes but unfortunately too much fear has gotten in the way. We are both amazing parents and our kids will be happy n never know the difference other than seeing mama smile,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cSometimes love looks funny. We are told to make sacrifices in life if it\u2019s true love well in this case it\u2019s me. I want to see happy Hank again\u2026 i miss that,\u201d Kendra wrote. \u201cMarriage was just a piece of paper and a piece of jewelry but our hearts will always be real. U will prob see us together a lot but it\u2019s because there\u2019s no hate.\u201d\n\nShe concluded: \u201cLove wins in this case it\u2019s just looks a little funny. Thank you Hank for a beautiful 8 years of marriage and 2 beautiful kids. I feel so thankful and blessed. \u2764\u201d\n\nFiling for Divorce\n\nAlso on April 6, Wilkinson filed court documents to legally end their nearly nine-year marriage. In documents obtained by PEOPLE, Wilkinson cites irreconcilable differences as the reason for their separation.", "images":
