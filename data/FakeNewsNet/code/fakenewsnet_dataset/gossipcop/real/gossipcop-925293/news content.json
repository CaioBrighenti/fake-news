I salute all of you, thank you for the love & energy.\"\n\nAs we previously reported, Odom was cut earlier this week -- and league sources told us it was because he simply wasn't ready to play.\n\nIce Cube spoke after the move and said he still loves Odom but the league needs players who are gonna play every week.", "images":
