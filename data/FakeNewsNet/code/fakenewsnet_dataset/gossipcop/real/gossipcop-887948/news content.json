It was recently claimed that the song\u2019s lyrics \u201cAh, he\u2019s in the sky with diamonds\u201d were originally penned as \u201cHarvey\u2019s in the sky with diamonds\u201c.\n\nThe singer has now responded to the speculation in an interview with MTV News, confirming: \u201cWhen I wrote that song, I suppose I had like a Harvey Weinstein/Harry Winston-type of character in mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI envisioned, like, a benevolent, diamond-bestowing-upon-starlets visual, like a Citizen Kane or something,\u201d Del Rey added. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure. I thought it was funny at the time, and I obviously find it really sad now. I support the women who have come forward. I think they\u2019re really brave for doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously I don\u2019t feel comfortable with it now,\u201d she said of the song. \u201cI thought of that right away.\u201d Asked whether she was \u201cretiring\u201d the track, Del Rey replied: \u201cDefinitely. That would be the only right thing to do\u201d.\n\nWatch Lana Del Rey discussing \u2018Cola\u2019 at the 12.18 mark below:\n\nLana Del Rey released her latest album \u2018Lust For Life\u2019 in July.", "images": ["https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2016/10/LukeMorganBrittonNMEauthor-Cropped-150x150.jpg", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2018/06/REV.NME_.WEB_.80px-1.png", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/11/Harvey-Weinstein-Lana-Del-Rey-GettyImages-493167027.jpg", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/10/placeholder.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/11/Harvey-Weinstein-Lana-Del-Rey-GettyImages-493167027.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Luke Morgan Britton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/lana-del-rey-harvey-weinstein-cola-2155455", "title": "Lana Del Rey reveals whether her song \u2018Cola\u2019 is about Harvey Weinstein", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Lana Del Rey confirms that 'Cola' was partly inspired by Harvey Weinstein and says she is retiring the track following the scandal", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lana Del Rey reveals whether her song 'Cola' is about Harvey Weinstein - NME", "description": "Lana Del Rey confirms that 'Cola' was partly inspired by Harvey Weinstein and says she is retiring the track following the scandal", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/lana-del-rey-harvey-weinstein-cola-2155455", "site_name": "NME", "image": {"identifier": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/11/Harvey-Weinstein-Lana-Del-Rey-GettyImages-493167027.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine", "section": "Music News", "published_time": "2017-11-01T15:52:33+01:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 208195102528120, "pages": 9577714166}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Lana Del Rey confirms that 'Cola' was partly inspired by Harvey Weinstein and says she is retiring the track following the scandal", "title": "Lana Del Rey reveals whether her song 'Cola' is about Harvey Weinstein - NME", "site": "@NME", "image": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2017/11/Harvey-Weinstein-Lana-Del-Rey-GettyImages-493167027.jpg", "creator": "@NME"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/55/2016/10/cropped-nme-site-icon-300x300.jpg"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTUk2AOuZhM?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/X34RO0zfA4Y?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1509547953.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
