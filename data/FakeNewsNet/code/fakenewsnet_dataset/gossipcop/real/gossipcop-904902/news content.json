In a video posted to Instagram, Cardi explained, \"We are really good friends and we are really good business partners\u2014and you know he\u2019s always somebody that I run to to talk to, and we got a lot of love for each other, but things just haven\u2019t been working out between us for a long time.\"\n\nThough brief, their relationship was a complete and utter whirlwind, full of major ups (who could forget Offset's very public\u2014and, I guess, faux\u2014proposal?) and a few downs (ahem, those cheating rumors). Let's take a look back, shall we?\n\nEarly 2017: Offset and Cardi B meet for the first time after Offset notices her immense talent and requests a dinner. As a Migos profile in Rolling Stone tells it:\n\nThe couple met about a year ago at Offset's insistence\u2013while he watched her rise as an artist, his interest grew, then exploded. \"I was like, 'Damn, I am on her!' \" he says. \"I am like, 'Shit, I like Cardi B!' \" He had a publicist set up a dinner in New York for a select group of women, including Cardi.\n\nBut their first real date? Keep reading because your S.O. could never.\n\nFebruary 5, 2017: Offset and Cardi B are spotted at the 2017 Super Bowl\u2014which Offset later says was their first legit date. \"That's a power move!\" he tells Rolling Stone.\n\nBecause life is good, Cardi B Insta Stories the date, and some lovely person compiles the whole thing on YouTube.\n\nFebruary 14, 2017: Cardi B makes the relationship Instagram official with some more footage of their first date\u2014and uses the word \"babe\" to describe Offset.\n\nMay 1, 2017: Cardi B and Offset are spotted at a Met Gala after party, looking, if we may say, FLAWLESS.\n\nSplash News\n\nMay 16, 2017: They release the video for their first collaboration, \"Lick.\"\n\nJuly 24, 2017: Offset buys Cardi B a custom $60k diamond chain, which she adores (who wouldn't, amirite?):\n\nCardi B and Offset at Meek Mill's Concert Tonight pic.twitter.com/7JMZGVMiKj \u2014 DailyCardi (@DailyCardi) July 25, 2017\n\nHere's a glorious close-up:\n\nAugust 27, 2017: Cardi B shuts down engagement rumors after fans read into her wearing a white dress. \"It is not true!\" she tells reporters at the VMAs: \"I\u2019m happy. Looking like I\u2019m getting married. But I\u2019m not there.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nOctober 11, 2017: Offset is out of the country for Cardi B's birthday so he posts a video on Instagram and writes a highly adorable message.\n\nOctober 22, 2017: The pair appear to briefly split up when Cardi B posts a photo to Insta Stories captioned \"single.\"\n\nShe later posts an update, saying she'd exaggerated.\n\nOctober 27, 2017:\n\nCardi B and Offset collaborate again, this time with Migos and Nicki Minaj.\n\nAlso October 27, 2017:\n\nOffset pops the question to Cardi B in the most extra way possible\u2014live onstage during Power 99 radio\u2019s Powerhouse concert at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. This video of the sweet moment is possibly the best thing your eyeballs will ever have the pleasure of seeing.\n\nOctober 28, 2017: Cardi B shows off her ring in a series of posts on Instagram, writing, \"Thank you for seeing the potential in me since you met me. For giving me advice molding me and loving me. Your such a amazing man to me your family, friends, kids and you are extremely talented.\"\n\nAlso, in case you're wondering, the ring is a massive 8 carats. We know this because Offset tells everyone on Insta Stories.\n\nDecember 21, 2017: Cardi B debuts her single \"Bartier Cardi,\" and fans criticize her for the many, many, many Offset references\u2014including \"Cardi put the pussy on Offset / Cartier, Cardi B brain on Offset.\"\n\nCardi B's response?\n\nDecember 24, 2017: A video leaks of a man who appears to be Offset in bed with another woman. The clip was allegedly filmed in September and stolen from Offset\u2019s iCloud. In a surprising twist, The Shade Room reveals that the reason Cardi B had posted about being single back in October was because she'd learned about his infidelity.\n\nDecember 25, 2017: Cardi B seemingly responds to cheating allegations with a brief yet to-the-point tweet:\n\nI still put the pussy on offset \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fBartier Cardi \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) December 25, 2017\n\nDecember 26, 2017: Cardi B and Offset pretend to have sex on Instagram Live, fully clothed.

I don\u2019t ask ya why you still with that man that lives with his mom, that don\u2019t pay your bills \u2026 Since when you guys had perfect relationship?\"\n\nPer Newsweek, she also writes on Instagram, \"Well if people are talking about it and keep asking me how I feel about the situation why not let them know? Right or wrong? No, it\u2019s not right for a n----- to cheat\u2026 But what you want me to do? Go fuck me another n----? Start all over again and get cheated on again? This shit happens to everyone. People handle they relationship different soo.\"\n\nJanuary 14, 2018: The Shade Room once again comes through and posts footage of Offset's new Cardi B neck tattoo. Because nothing makes up for a cheating scandal like a public and extremely permanent declaration of love, right?\n\nFebruary 27, 2018: Cardi B talks about Offset's cheating scandal in an interview with Cosmopolitan (*waves hi*), and implies that she's not guilt-free either. \"It\u2019s like everybody is coming down my neck like, 'Why are you not leaving him? You have low self-esteem.' I don\u2019t have low self-esteem \u2026 I know I look good. I know I\u2019m rich, I know I\u2019m talented.

I\u2019m gonna let him say the name since he named the baby.\"\n\nJune 25, 2018: Surprise! Turns out, Cardi and Offset have been married since September 2017. Wait, what?! TMZ was able to obtain the couple's marriage license from Fulton County in Georgia. So that highly public proposal was...just for show.\n\nFunnily enough, at the BET Awards the night before the news broke, Offset thanked \"his wife\" onstage when his rap group Migos was accepting an award, which made people wonder if they were already married.\n\nJuly 10, 2018: The baby's here! In a Beyonc\u00e9-esque move, Cardi reveals her daughter's name via a floral Instagram pic the day after she gave birth. She captioned the photo, \"Kulture Kiari Cephus.\" What a name! Twitter definitely had plenty to say about it.\n\nBut let's be real. With parents named Belcalis Marlenis Almanzar and Kiari Kendrell Cephus, Kulture couldn't have just any regular ol' name.\n\nSeptember 20, 2018: Cardi B officially confirms that she and Offset have actually been married since September 20, 2017. And in case you were wondering what she wore to her wedding: it was a white tracksuit. Yup. Classic Cardi.\n\nDecember 5, 2018: In an unexpected twist, Cardi takes to Instagram to address all the people \"bugging\" her about her relationship. And as it turns out, she and Offset have fallen \"out of love.\" \ud83d\ude22 In the video, the rapper says, \"It\u2019s nobody fault, it's just, like, I guess we just grew out of love but we are not together anymore.\" Sad.\n\n\n\nJanuary 31, 2018: A week after Cardi B said she missed being home with her family, TMZ reported Cardi B and Offset are getting back together, and Cardi is apparently moving back to their Atlanta home.\n\nInstagram", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cardi-offset-1524156381.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-845448648-1544006510.jpg?crop=0.567xw:0.425xh;0.196xw,0.139xh&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cardi-offset-1524156381.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mehera", "Mehera Bonner Is A News Writer Who Focuses On Celebrities", "Royals"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a19856414/cardi-b-offset-relationship-timeline/", "title": "A Definitive Timeline of Cardi B and Offset's Relationship", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "A Definitive Timeline of Cardi B and Offset's Relationship", "description": "R.I.P.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a19856414/cardi-b-offset-relationship-timeline/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cardi-offset-1524156381.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2019-01-31 03:42:06", "published_time": "2018-12-05 07:32:00", "section": "Celebrities & Entertainment"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cardi-offset-1524156381.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Rappers Cardi B and Offset's Relationship Timeline - Why Did Cardi B and Offset Split?", "description": "News broke today that Cardi B and Offset have split following a year of marriage.
