Brown/Getty\n\nWhen it comes to fashionable footwear on the Screen Actors Guild Awards red carpet, Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown is all about comfort.\n\nThe 13-year-old actress, who is nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, wore a high-low sequin pink Calvin Klein 205W39NYC halter dress and Repossi jewelry to the award show, but instead of heels, she opted for crisp white low-top Converse sneakers.\n\nHer reasoning? \u201cYou got to go for Converse. You gotta dance the night away, win or lose!\u201d Brown told PEOPLE on the red carpet about looking forward to hit the dance floor at the SAG Awards afterparties.\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full SAG Awards coverage to get the latest news on Hollywood\u2019s big night.\n\n\u201cYou know you gotta keep it stylish,\u201d the actress continued on the E!\u2019s Live from the Red Carpet. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to go to the parties. I love to dance that\u2019s why I brought these,\u201d she added, pointing to her sneakers.\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.

You are beautiful with or without. I learnt that too x. The last strand of hair cut off was the moment my whole face was on show and I couldn\u2019t hide behind my hair like I used to. As I looked in the mirror I realized I had one job to do. Inspire.\u201d\n\nThe 24th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards are broadcast live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on both TNT and TBS starting at 8 p.m. ET.", "images":
