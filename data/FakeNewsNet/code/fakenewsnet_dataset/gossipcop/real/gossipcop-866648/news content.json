The three-time Vogue cover girl is living her best life, and has the boyfriend, career, and jet-setting social life to prove it. But if Hadid knows the secrets to happiness and success, she\u2019s not shy about sharing them, and at the Gramercy offices of her agency IMG Models, she took on a spirited game of 73 Questions, offering up practical advice (never cut your own bangs before a campaign shoot), trade secrets (even supermodels fall asleep in their makeup), and even a Taylor Swift playlist.\n\nThere is, of course, more to Hadid than what\u2019s on her Instagram feed, and here she provides insight into exactly how a model makes the move from bit player to superstar. First step: Listen to your parents. \u201cIf you\u2019re not the nicest, most hardworking girl in the industry, there\u2019s going to be someone prettier, nicer, and more hardworking,\u201d says Hadid, sharing a piece of advice picked up from mom, Yolanda. Niceness isn\u2019t something Hadid has to fake, but the vampy characters she portrays in editorials require a Sasha Fierce\u2013esque alter ego\u2014and plenty of on-set chips and guac.\n\nPoring through her portfolio with manager Luiz Mattos, Hadid describes landing covers for the American, British, French, and Italian editions of Vogue as a career highlight: For her, nothing\u2014not even getting her own Barbie\u2014has compared to the thrill of joining a club that includes Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.\n\nAnd although her millennial-Barbie moments and off-duty style make her a paparazzi magnet, even Hadid has fashion role models she looks up to: She says she wouldn\u2019t mind raiding Rihanna\u2019s or the Olsen twins\u2019 wardrobes. As for her own closet, a peek inside is likely to reveal plenty of runway fashion alongside sporty gear like Kobe Bryant jerseys and equestrian pieces left over from her days as a competitive horseback rider.\n\nThough Hadid is quick with a witty answer on nearly every subject, there are a few things she\u2019d rather keep to herself: She demurs, for instance, when it comes time to pick her favorite tattoo on her boyfriend Zayn Malik\u2019s body. Of course, every supermodel needs to maintain a bit of mystery\u2014and besides, with her cover-starring streak showing no signs of slowing, there\u2019s always the next round.", "images": ["https://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59678c3c0dd872334936691c/16:9/pass/00-social-tout-gigi.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59678c3c0dd872334936691c/16:9/pass/00-social-tout-gigi.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/gigi-hadid-73-questions-video-vogue-august-cover", "title": "73 Questions With Gigi Hadid", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/gigi-hadid-73-questions-video-vogue-august-cover", "title": "73 Questions With Gigi Hadid", "description": "Gigi Hadid talks Zayn Malik, Taylor Swift, meeting Kobe, and getting her own Barbie in 73 questions.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59678c3c0dd872334936691c/16:9/pass/00-social-tout-gigi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "73 Questions With Gigi Hadid - Vogue", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59678c3c0dd872334936691c/16:9/pass/00-social-tout-gigi.jpg"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Gigi Hadid talks Zayn Malik, Taylor Swift, meeting Kobe, and getting her own Barbie in 73 questions."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=https://www.vogue.com/article/gigi-hadid-73-questions-video-vogue-august-cover, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "description": "Gigi Hadid talks Zayn Malik, Taylor Swift, meeting Kobe, and getting her own Barbie in 73 questions.", "keywords": "Celebrity Style,Runway,Supermodels!,Gigi Hadid,Fashion,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Celebrity Style,Runway,Supermodels!,Gigi Hadid,Fashion,mobileAppReadyTrue", "articleSection": "Fashion", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499950800.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
