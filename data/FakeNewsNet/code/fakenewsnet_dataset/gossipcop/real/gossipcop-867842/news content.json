He\u2019s lovely, he\u2019s a team player, he wants to do a good job, he takes direction, he\u2019s very open.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Ed Sheeran\u2019s \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 cameo receives mixed reviews from fans\n\nThe episode\u2019s director continued: \u201cHe\u2019s a big fan of the show and he was really excited to be a part of it. I think his lovely voice was used to great effect and he just has a really nice presence.\u201d\n\nPodeswa also said that Sheeran \u201cblends into the world of the show in a nice way\u201d and that if people didn\u2019t know who the singer was, \u201cnobody would even blink about his presence on the show.\u201d\n\nSheeran\u2019s appearance as a Lannister soldier drew a mix of criticism and praise from fans of the show, including some calling the show \u201cless authentic\u201d due to his cameo.\n\nPodeswa told Newsweek that he was \u201cquite surprised\u201d about the reaction to Sheeran\u2019s appearance.\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s very well known and a successful singer but you\u2019re in the bubble of the show \u2014 the cast are well known too, everybody is really well known\u2026 none of them can walk down the street without being followed,\u201d Podeswa said. \u201cI think people interrogated it too much, they\u2019re bringing so much of his [superstar] presence into the thing which is far beyond what anybody was thinking going into it. He is known to the producers of the show and some of the cast, and he\u2019s a gigantic fan of the show.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 actor Kit Harington speaks out about \u2018a**holes\u2019 who leak spoilers\n\nThe Castle on the Hill singer isn\u2019t the first musician to make a cameo appearance on the HBO show. Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol, Will Champion from Coldplay, Sigur R\u00f3s band members Orri P\u00e1ll D\u00fdrason, Georg H\u00f3lm and J\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r Birgisson and Brann Dailor, Bill Kelliher and Brent Hinds of the American heavy metal band Mastodon, have previously appeared on Game of Thrones.\n\nSo I did my scene this morning for @GameOfThrones. I looked like this. Can't say much just it's no pivotal role. Fun! pic.twitter.com/aV9ii7X1 \u2014 gary lightbody (@garysnowpatrol) July 23, 2012\n\nREAD MORE: New \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Season 7 trailer: Winter is coming\n\nAfter Sheeran\u2019s appearance on the show as a singing soldier became a buzzed-about topic on social media, his Twitter account suddenly vanished.\n\nThe Twitter disappearance was short-lived because he is now back online but all of his tweets since April 2015 have been removed and the singer\u2019s more than 19 million followers have been reduced to a few thousand.\n\nThe 26-year-old told Britain\u2019s Sun tabloid this month that he was no longer using his Twitter account aside from posting his Instagram pictures to it. He called Twitter a platform for \u201csaying mean things\u201d and was trying to \u201cwork out why people dislike me so much.\u201d\n\nSheeran took to Instagram on Wednesday to deny that his Twitter absence had anything to do with the backlash from his Game of Thrones appearance.\n\n\u201cI came off Twitter coz I was always intending to come off Twitter, had nothing to do with what people said about my Game of Thrones cameo,\u201d the singer wrote. \u201cWhy the hell would I worry what people thought about that. It\u2019s clearly f***in\u2019 awesome.\u201d\n\nThe HBO drama\u2019s seventh-season premiere last weekend drew a record-setting 10.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen company figures released Tuesday.\n\n\u2014With files from the Associated Press", "images": ["https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/chy102175254_high.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276",
