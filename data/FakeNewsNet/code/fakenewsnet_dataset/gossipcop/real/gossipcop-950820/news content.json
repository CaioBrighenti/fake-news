Though she didn\u2019t identify the Big Brother and Ex on the Beach star, the post comes months after Calafiore allegedly cheated on her with The Challenge star Cara Maria Sorbello, whom he\u2019s now dating.\n\n\u201cI am really struggling today,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get out of bed even though I have tons of s\u2014 to get done before the holidays. Control the controllable they say. Well, I\u2019ve tried that. I don\u2019t like to show all my vulnerability, because it gets taken advantage of along with my love and kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost days I feel myself hardening since my relationship ended,\u201d she continued. \u201cI honestly believed I had found my person. He was everything to me. Now the thought of dating leaves me terrified to let anyone in. It\u2019s not like I have anything to give out anyway. I\u2019m trying to wrap any love I still have in me around myself.\u201d\n\nMaltby, who vied for Nick Viall\u2018s heart on The Bachelor in 2017, then recalled grieving the loss of her fianc\u00e9, who died from an apparent drug overdose in 2011.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this place before, after my fianc\u00e9 died and that life was taken from me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is different. You\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been slowly draining since the lies started and my ex cheated on me,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe people that know and love me, see how much this has taken from me, especially physically. The \u2018revenge bod\u2019 I\u2019ve tried to joke about isn\u2019t some new diet trend, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been physically sick from the anxiety, stress, grief and lies inflicted on me for months. They\u2019ve seen the messages and emails all summer, fall and now winter. Even this week, begging me to unblock him because \u2018we are important in each other\u2019s lives.\u2019 \u201c\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Struggles Not to Cry as She Talks About Khlo\u00e9 Giving Birth During Cheating Scandal\n\nMaltby said she \u201cmade a lot of excuses trying to rationalize his behavior\u201d but \u201cwasn\u2019t able to come to terms\u201d with it.\n\n\u201cI believe I was shown the person he wants to be but something is holding him back from it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to fortify my wall, all the while knowing, no matter what I block him on, he still has the capability to break it down and he\u2019s still trying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my heart, I know he\u2019s not a bad person,\u201d she continued. \u201cSomewhere in his mind though, he has made himself believe that it\u2019s ok to continue to tell me he needs me, misses me, still loves me and wants to fix everything. Actions speak louder than words. Today, I can\u2019t explain today. I\u2019ve just had enough. I couldn\u2019t just post the highlight reel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank God for my therapist,\u201d she added. \u201cSome days are ok, some are really good and I had a great night last night, but today, my place is a mess and I can\u2019t get out of bed and honestly, I just hurt. I\u2019m working on it though.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE has reached out to Calafiore for comment.\n\nImage zoom Cara Maria Sorbello Mike Coppola/Getty\n\nMaltby and Calafiore made their relationship Instagram official in January 2018.\n\nIn the wake of the cheating allegations in June, Calafiore told E! News he was \u201cnot proud of my actions these past weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know they speak louder than these words. I have destroyed the one person that has believed in and brought out the best in me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have many things I need to work on and repair internally. I want to be better. I know I haven\u2019t earned it, but I ask for patience and privacy while I work on repairing myself.\u201d", "images":
