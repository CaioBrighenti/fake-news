And according to the 27-year-old Modern Family star, it\u2019s all thanks to a direct message Adams sent her on social media.\n\n\u201cHave you seen those memes of \u2018Slide into the DMs?\u2019 That. He slid into my DMs,\u201d Hyland told comedian Jimmy Kimmel during an appearance on his hit late night talk show Tuesday.\n\nHyland and Adams, 33, began flirting on Twitter last summer during his stint as the bartender in Bachelor in Paradise \u2014 though Hyland had been vocal about her not-so-secret crush on the radio DJ since his time vying for JoJo Fletcher\u2018s heart on season 12 of The Bachelorette in 2016.\n\n\u201cI was following him,\u201d she told Kimmel. \u201cWe had tweeted each other because I thought he was funny and he was a fan of the show. I saw him as the bartender and I was like, \u2018That\u2019s really cute.\u2019 \u201c\n\nImage zoom Wells Adams and Sarah Hyland Todd Williamson/January Images/Shutterstock\n\nIt helped that Adams\u2019 first message piqued Hyland\u2019s interest. \u201cI was single, obviously, and was like, \u2018This is really awesome. You\u2019re being very forward and it\u2019s sexy and not aggressive but very confident and sexy,\u2019 and I liked that,\u201d she recalled.\n\nSo what did Adams say? It was surprisingly simple: \u201c\u2018Next time I\u2019m in LA, I\u2019m taking you out for drinks and tacos.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cI love tacos,\u201d Hyland gushed to Kimmel. \u201cHe loves taco,s so that was his thing. Like, \u2018I love tacos, lets see if she loves tacos.\u2019 We both love tacos! We have an obsession with tacos. Tacos and tequila, that\u2019s our thing.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Sarah Hyland and Wells Adams Allen Berezovsky/Getty\n\nRELATED: All of Sarah Hyland\u2019s Cutest Moments with Boyfriend Wells Adams\n\nThey share more in common than tacos: Earlier this month, Hyland praised her beau, sharing a photo of the two dressed in black to support Time\u2019s Up at Amazon\u2019s Golden Globes afterparty.\n\n\u201cVery proud to be with a man that thinks it\u2019s sexy when a woman speaks her mind and stands up for herself. Which, in my opinion, is VERY sexy,\u201d she captioned the photo, adding: \u201cI\u2019m also very proud of my @plannedparenthood pin.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Sarah Hyland Reveals Her Modern Family Character Is Bisexual\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing they haven\u2019t discussed: the secrets of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually never asked him about that,\u201d Hyland told Kimmel on Tuesday.\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live! airs weeknights (11:30 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "images":
