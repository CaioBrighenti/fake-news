I guess having @GovMikeHuckabee as your dad does that to you.\u201d\n\nThe problem is, the picture he shared was of Philipps\u2019 on Freaks and Geeks. In Judd Apatow and Paul Feig\u2019s short-lived NBC series, the actress played Kim Kelly, the rebellious on-and-off girlfriend of Daniel Desario (James Franco).\n\nImage zoom\n\nThe mistake soon made its way onto Philipps timeline, and she quickly took notice, tweeting, \u201cARE YOU F\u2014ING KIDDING ME? IS THIS A JOKE? THIS IS ME FROM FREAKS AND GEEKS. FAKE NEWS.\u201d\n\nARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? IS THIS A JOKE? THIS IS ME FROM FREAKS AND GEEKS. FAKE NEWS. https://t.co/3l8WVntlG3 \u2014 Busy Philipps (@Busyphilipps25) September 14, 2017\n\nHer all-caps tirade didn\u2019t end there. \u201cALSO I LOOK NOTHING LIKE SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL?!?????!!!!!\u201d She continued, \u201cI AM NEVER GETTING OVER THIS. I AM ACTUALLY DEAD NOW.\u201d\n\nALSO I LOOK NOTHING LIKE SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL -?!?????!!!!! https://t.co/3l8WVntlG3 \u2014 Busy Philipps (@Busyphilipps25) September 14, 2017\n\nI AM NEVER GETTING OVER THIS. I AM ACTUALLY DEAD NOW https://t.co/3l8WVntlG3 \u2014 Busy Philipps (@Busyphilipps25) September 14, 2017\n\nFor her final point, Philipps concluded, \u201cALSO. Pick on a woman for the insane lies she tells. Not cause she looks pissed while telling them. I love women who look pissed off.\u201d\n\nALSO. Pick on a woman for the insane lies she tells. Not cause she looks pissed off while telling them. I love women who look pissed off. \u2014 Busy Philipps (@Busyphilipps25) September 14, 2017\n\nWhen alerted to his error, Cooper initially seemed to dismiss the possibility that the photo was of Philipps. (NOTE: The photo of Philipps is the first image to appear in a Google Image search of \u201cSarah Huckabee as teen.\u201d) But, eventually realizing he was wrong, he tried his best to apologize to Philipps by repeatedly declaring that he \u201cloved\u201d her on the ABC comedy Cougar Town, where she starred opposite Courteney Cox for six seasons. (No word on what he thought of Dawson\u2019s Creek.)\n\nRead his full defense below.\n\nWait\u2026do you really think that's a pic of @Busyphilipps25? She's awesome! I loved her in Cougar Town!! \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) September 14, 2017\n\nWow \u2013 thanks for pointing that out! I heard of that show but never watched it myself. I do agree that Busy is an wonderful actress! \ud83d\ude00 \u2014 Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) September 14, 2017\n\nI missed watching Freaks and Geeks (although my kids loved it!). I found that pic online & it was identified as being Sarah Sanders. My bad! \u2014 Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) September 15, 2017\n\nI'm indeed a HUGE fan of Busy! She was my favorite character on Cougar Town (tho I did miss watching Freaks and Geeks). Anyway, I APOLOGIZE! \u2014 Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) September 15, 2017", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/all-that-ally-brooke-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/1568-angel_1200x6282.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/angel2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/coopertweet.jpg", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5ef8613926fe5ac5d5623868eca6ee9f?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/noah.jpg?crop=0px%2C100px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Derek Lawrence"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/14/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders-freaks-and-geeks/", "title": "Busy Philipps loses it after being mistaken for a young Sarah Huckabee Sanders in Freaks and Geeks photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Busy Philipps, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Freaks and Geeks", "news_keywords": "Busy Philipps, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Freaks and Geeks", "description": "The actress freaked out when a photo of her on 'Freaks and Geeks' was being identified as the White House press secretary.", "og": {"title": "Busy Philipps Loses It After Being Mistaken for a Young Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 'Freaks and Geeks' Photo", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/14/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders-freaks-and-geeks/", "description": "'Freaks and Geeks and Future White House Press Secretary'", "image": {"identifier": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/14/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders-freaks-and-geeks/", "description": "The actress freaked out when a photo of her on 'Freaks and Geeks' was being identified as the White House press secretary.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/14/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders-freaks-and-geeks/", "title": "Busy Philipps Loses It After Being Mistaken for a Young Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 'Freaks and Geeks' Photo", "description": "The actress freaked out when a photo of her on 'Freaks and Geeks' was being identified as the White House press secretary.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/busy-philipps-sarah-huckabee-sanders.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505361600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
