Our own investigation will continue based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Getty (2)\n\nOn Tuesday, 10 days after announcing production had officially been halted, Warner Bros. confirmed that filming will soon resume.\n\n\u201cAs we previously stated, we recently became aware of allegations regarding an incident on the set of Bachelor in Paradise in Mexico. We take all such allegations seriously. The safety, security and well-being of the cast and crew is our number one concern, and we suspended filming so that the allegations could be investigated immediately and thoroughly. Our internal investigation, conducted with the assistance of an outside law firm, has now been completed. Out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved, we do not intend to release the videotape of the incident. We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy. Production on this season of Bachelor in Paradise will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show\u2019s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.\u201d\n\nABC confirmed the news with its own statement to PEOPLE on Tuesday: \u201cWe appreciate the swift and complete investigation by Warner Bros. into allegations of misconduct on the set of Bachelor in Paradise. Given their results, the series will resume production and will air this summer on ABC.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Corinne Olympios Breaks Silence on Bachelor in Paradise Scandal: \u2018This Is My Worst Nightmare\u2019\n\nPEOPLE sources previously confirmed season 4 production was suspended after a producer raised concerns about an alleged sexual encounter between contestants DeMario Jackson and Olympios, both of whom had reportedly been drinking heavily all day.\n\nBachelor in Paradise will return later this summer on ABC.", "images":
