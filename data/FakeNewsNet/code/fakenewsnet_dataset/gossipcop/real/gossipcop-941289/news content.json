Issa Rae, the evening\u2019s host, wore a marine blue jumpsuit with sheer overlay featuring over 180,000 Swarovski crystals by Pyer Moss. Her black belt was embroidered with the title of a Boris Gardiner song that was used at Pyer Moss\u2019s Spring 2018 show. The look itself, and its potent message, was by far the hit of the evening on the red carpet and on social media, where Rae\u2019s many fans celebrated her choice to promote black culture on the red carpet.\n\nThe phrase on Rae\u2019s belt was a something of a last-minute addition to the look. Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond told Vogue, \u201cThere was a song on the soundtrack from our runway show in February. When we were finishing the dress, I was at Roots Picnic and we thought it needed something to make it more Issa. She\u2019s a star, so the quote was perfect.\u201d The overall look, with its sweeping lines and glittery spirit, were drawn from another star, Jean-Raymond explained, \u201cDiana Ross in Mohagany was the main inspiration. I took that and put Pyer Moss into it, which was easy for me to do.\u201d\n\nJean-Raymond, who was nominated for the Swarovski Award for Emerging Talent, is one of American fashion\u2019s rising stars, and the recognition from dressing Rae in such a poignant look is not lost on him. \u201cAt first I didnt understand the magnitude of it, but as I see the online reaction to it right now, I understand that its important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means that someone is paying attention, that what I am doing is important.\u201d\n\nRae\u2019s stylist Jason Rembert knew Jean-Raymond was going to be the right designer for the host\u2019s dress from the start. \u201cThe collaboration just felt right. Kerby is a talented designer who is opening many doors for others. Issa is a fixture in media who is doing the same. I\u2019m inspired by both,\u201d he said, adding that the message he hopes Rae sent in her jumpsuit is \u201cthat being your true and authentic self is always going to be a win.\u201d He summarized her looks of the evening, including a bright-green suit and slinky red dress worn onstage, as \u201cunapologetically black.\u201d\n\nBlackness was a central topic at last night\u2019s awards, which honored British Vogue editor in chief Edward Enninful with the Media Award and modeling legend Naomi Campbell with the Fashion Icon Award. Enninful was presented the honor from none other than Oprah and used his acceptance speech as a clarion call for inclusion and diversity in fashion. \u201cIn a world that is increasingly divided, we must remember: We are more alike than we are different. British Vogue is about being inclusive. It\u2019s not just the color of your skin but the diversity of perspective. That\u2019s what drives us forward, not back.\u201d\n\nIn her opening monologue Rae quipped, \u201cI\u2019m about as fashionable as Kanye is black. Only when it\u2019s convenient,\u201d referencing West\u2019s deeply offensive and mis-held belief articulated in an interview with TMZ that slavery was a choice. Our only qualm with Rae\u2019s joke is that by our count, she\u2019s fashionable all the time.\n\nCFDA 2018: The Latest Celebrity Arrivals, Breaking News, Full List of Winners, and More\n\nSee All of the Celebrity Looks From the 2018 CFDA Awards Red Carpet:\n\nAdvertisement 1 / 103\n\nWatch: Kate!
