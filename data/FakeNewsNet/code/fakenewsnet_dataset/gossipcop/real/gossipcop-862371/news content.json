Alongside Sugarland's Kristian Bush, Hale discusses Bush's influence as a mentor. (Published Tuesday, March 4, 2014)\n\nLucy Hale from \"Pretty Little Liars\" Works on Her First Country Album\n\nWell, this is probably one of the more bizarre controversies Lucy Hale will ever find herself in. Hale says she is sorry to anyone who got offended after she body-shamed... herself.\n\nThe 28-year-old \"Pretty Little Liars\" star posted on Twitter and Instagram this week a throwback pic of herself as a bridesmaid alongside her father as a Father's Day tribute and then drew criticism over a comment she made to a fan.\n\n\"Ugh, I was so fat,\" she said.\n\nYou taught me to have soul. I love you daddy. A post shared by Lucy Hale (@lucyhale) on Jun 18, 2017 at 2:39pm PDT\n\nMany fans were not having it. Hale was bombarded with comments from fans, some of which expressed concern about her health.\n\n\"@lucyhale fat? Are you kidding me??\" tweeted user @ciaraferguson17.\n\nOthers were annoyed that people were annoyed.\n\n\"Jesus. People can't even say they're fat or feel fat without offending anyone,\" wrote user @missmcizzle.\n\nHale disabled comments on her Instagram photo. She also later took to Twitter to apologize.\n\n\"Sometimes I forget that people are watching everything I do and I say things I don't mean. I'm extremely sorry if my comment about my weight offended anyone,\" she wrote. \"Sometimes we can be our own worst enemy. I know people look up to me and I should be way more aware of what I say sometimes. Thanks for all the love and support. Hope y'all can forgive me!\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright E!
