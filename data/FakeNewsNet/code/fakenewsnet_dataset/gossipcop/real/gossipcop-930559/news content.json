News, she said: \"I have the world's greatest husband. I swear, I got very lucky, man. I got a man that has got a lot of patience and is incredibly supportive of our family.\"\n\nDespite only marrying three years ago, Mila and 40-year-old Ashton have known each other since the late 90s, when they starred together on \u2018That 70s Show\u2019.\n\nAshton Kutcher and wife Mila Kunis have become parents for the second time (AP)\n\nThey began dating in 2012, three years before tying the knot, when \u2018Jobs\u2019 actor Ashton was undergoing a divorce from first wife Demi Moore, whom he married in 2005.\n\nMila\u2019s comments come after she previously gushed over her brood, saying she and Ashton are \u201cgrateful\u201d to have two tots of their own, as they were desperate to start a family.\n\nShe said in November: \"I have an 11-month-old and a three-year-old - I have tiny little humans. Ashton and I wanted kids so bad; we were so ready to be parents.\n\n\"We were able to have this little family the way we wanted, and I'm so grateful for it and it's the one thing that I can't control.\n\n(L-R) Actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis don't shy away from public displays of affection\n\n\"That's where my vulnerability is. My job, it comes and goes. You don't get a job, you get a job, you don't get a job. Your kids, you just want one thing.\u201d\n\nPreviously, the \u2018Black Swan\u2019 star also credited Ashton with helping her learn about the \u201cbusiness side\u201d of their shared profession.\n\nShe said: \"Honestly, full disclosure, when I started dating Ashton, I was like, 'I don't want to know [about the] business side, it makes me so uncomfortable.' And he said, 'Right, stop, get on the call.'\n\n\"And then I started educating myself, getting the language right. I would ask him questions, Googled lots of things, and now I know what everybody's doing, I know what I can do, I know what I can ask for. I am way more involved than I was five years ago.\n\nZoe Saldana, Mila Kunis, and Ashton Kutcher attend the women's march Los Angeles on January 20, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.

Think about that, perspective-wise.\"\n\nOnline Editors", "images":
