(Warning: Spoilers ahead!)\n\nRebecca decided to surprise Kate by attending her first singing gig\u2014but rather than appreciate her mother's support, Kate lashed out and unleashed years of anger in the process. \u201cYou still make me feel like a stupid, fat little kid,\u201d Kate admitted after Rebecca said she sang \"incredibly beautifully\"\u2014a word choice that set off Kate. Dumbfounded by her daughter's accusation, Rebecca asked what she had ever done to make her feel that way, and all Kate could could say was, \"You existed.\" Ouch.\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, Kate followed it up by telling her mother that she only wanted a daughter like herself, and she was never going to be that. \"No, you wanted me to be the you that you never became.\" Rebecca remained impressively calm and collected, telling her daughter that she had nothing to say because, \"I can't think of anything that would be quite that terrible. You and your brothers are my entire life.\u201d\n\nSo what provoked Kate to lash out like that? With too many questions and not enough answers, we asked executive producer and co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker to fill us in.\n\nGlamour: My jaw was on the floor with some of the things Kate said to Rebecca. Did you discuss how far you were willing to push their conversation? Or what damage this could do to their relationship?\n\nIsaac Aptaker: We're very fortunate we have a lot of brilliant female producers and writers on our staff who have wonderfully complicated relationships with all of their mothers. [Laughs] So, we had a lot of personal experience and real stories to draw from. Dan Fogelman wrote that episode with Bekah Brunstetter, who is one of our writers, and they did such a good job capturing how much love is there, but how much pain these two women have caused each other over the years, and continue to inadvertently cause each other. It's a long scene, and there's a lot to it. These episodes are only 42 minutes, [so in editing] we wondered if there was anywhere to make a cut, but Mandy and Chrissy are just so good, and we found it so compelling that we left it pretty much untouched. I think that was the right decision.\n\nGlamour: At the end of their exchange, Toby tells Rebecca he doesn\u2019t know the full history between Kate and her mother. Is it safe to say that for us, as viewers, we don\u2019t know either? Because what we\u2019ve seen so far of Kate and Rebecca\u2019s relationship doesn\u2019t indicate there\u2019s this much bad blood.\n\nIA: Yeah, definitely. The relationship between Kate and Rebecca is going to be a big one that we\u2019re really unpacking this year. Kind of how in season one it really focused on the dynamic between Randall and his mother and the secret of William that she kept from him for so long. This season we\u2019re really diving into the mother-daughter relationship and what it was like for these two women growing up over the years and how they drifted apart, and how they can hopefully come back together as adults.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42af251512378d5b0c01a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%252520Shot%2525202017-10-03%252520at%2525205.27.06%252520PM.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ca4e5c1053aa86e1b7bb6e2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/this-is-us.JPG", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1476134206/glamour_mandy-moore-and-milo-ventimiglia-find-their-celebrity-birthday-twins.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42a9c240b1e16740eaf72/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/NUP_175597_0631.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa", "Jessica Radloff", "Anna Moeslein", "Jessica Radlof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-story-behind-kate-and-rebecca-fight-on-this-is-us-season-two-episode-two", "title": "The Story Behind Kate and Rebecca's Explosive Fight on 'This Is Us' Season Two Episode Two", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "This Is Us co-executive producer Isaac Aptaker reveals the story behind Kate and Rebecca's explosive fight in episode two.", "keywords": "this is us,tv,mandy moore,chrissy metz,isaac aptaker", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "There's more to their complicated relationship than we've seen so far.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "The Story Behind Kate and Rebecca's Explosive Fight on Tonight's 'This Is Us'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-story-behind-kate-and-rebecca-fight-on-this-is-us-season-two-episode-two"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "There's more to their complicated relationship than we've seen so far.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "The Story Behind Kate and Rebecca's Explosive Fight on Tonight's 'This Is Us'"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
