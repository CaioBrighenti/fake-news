Here, she shares what makes her laugh, and the must-have lipsticks that enhance her signature grin.\n\nMY SMILE IS...\n\nAll mine. The bottom front teeth overlap. I had braces as a kid, and now I'm trying to fix the same thing again with Invisalign.

I do the Tracy Anderson Method, so there's a lot of mirror work involved. When I see my red lips reflecting back at me, I'm like, \"Yeah, girl, that's right!\"\n\nImage zoom Time Inc Digital Studio\n\nMY MOTTO IS...\n\nLife is better when taken with a giggle. Listen, I'm not always smiling and laughing. There are times when I'm quiet, angry, or sad\u2014and I make space for all those aspects of myself.
