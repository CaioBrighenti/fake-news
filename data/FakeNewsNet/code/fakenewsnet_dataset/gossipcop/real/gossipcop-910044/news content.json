Photo: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images\n\nKate Winslet seems to have addressed sexual-abuse allegations against her Wonder Wheel director Woody Allen. While accepting a prize at the London Critics\u2019 Circle film awards, Winslet alluded to Allen, who has been accused of molesting his daughter Dylan Farrow: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to stand here this evening, and keep to myself some bitter regrets that I have at poor decisions to work with individuals with whom I wish I had not.\u201d\n\nAfter taking a moment to compose herself, Winslet added: \u201cIt has become clear to me that by not saying anything, I might be adding to the anguish of many courageous women and men. Sexual abuse is a crime. While it rests with the rule of law to pass judgment, it lies with all of us to listen to the smallest of voices and to never stop listening.\u201d Winslet then told the audience that many have been reluctant to say something earlier for fear of saying the wrong thing: \u201cThose who do have a voice are becoming afraid to say anything, because of intense scrutiny and criticism,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody should be exempt from having a right to speak in support of vulnerable people. There are those who can speak so powerfully for those who are not able to do so themselves, and let us please not make this about which people express public regret.\u201d\n\nEarlier in this awards season, Winslet told the New York Times that she couldn\u2019t address the allegations, as she didn\u2019t know \u201cwhether any of it is true or false.\u201d\n\nSee video of Winslet\u2019s remarks below.\n\nAlthough Winslet starred in The Reader, a movie distributed by Harvey Weinstein, she condemned him in October.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/19/GettyImages-960052182.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-crawl.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/06/23/13-noah.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-hopper-david-harbour-stranger-things-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/29/29-kate-winslet.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Dressing-Funny-Rachel-Dratch-Tina-Fey.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-r-kelly.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-stuber.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/29/29-kate-winslet.w330.h330.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-arti-gollapudi.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-billie-eilish-song-of-the-week.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/big-brother-sunday.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-julio-torres.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-lil-wayne.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/15/15-r-kelly-criminal-record.w536.h536.jpg ", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/10/16/2-Sarah-Jessica-Parker.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/06/24/24-the-bachelorette.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-review.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-wife.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Oliver-Jackson-Cohen.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Wet-Hot-American-MidSommar.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/29/29-kate-winslet.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hunter Harris"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/kate-winslet-alludes-to-bitter-regrets-over-woody-allen.html", "title": "Kate Winslet Alludes to \u2018Bitter Regrets\u2019 Over Woody Allen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Kate Winslet Reveals \u2018Bitter Regrets\u2019 About Working With a Certain Man", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/kate-winslet-alludes-to-bitter-regrets-over-woody-allen.html", "description": "Winslet didn\u2019t name Allen in her remarks, but said \u201cSexual abuse is a crime.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/29/29-kate-winslet.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kate Winslet Alludes to \u2018Bitter Regrets\u2019 Over Woody Allen", "description": "Winslet didn\u2019t name Allen in her remarks, but said \u201cSexual abuse is a crime.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/29/29-kate-winslet.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hunteryharris", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-29T14:34:00.512Z", "tag": "kate winslet, woody allen, movies, dylan farrow, wonder wheel", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Kate Winslet didn\u2019t name Woody Allen in her remarks about having regrets over who she had worked with, but said \u201cSexual abuse is a crime.\u201d", "sailthru.tags": "kate winslet, woody allen, movies, dylan farrow, wonder wheel", "author": "Hunter Harris", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517236440.512, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
