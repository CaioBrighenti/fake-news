Supernatural. American Dad. New Girl. What do all of these movies and television shows have in common?\n\nCurtis Armstrong.\n\nA legendary comedic second banana to a litany of major stars, Curtis is forever cemented in the public imagination as Booger from Revenge of the Nerds. A classically trained actor, Curtis began his incredible 40-year career onstage but progressed rapidly to film and television. He was typecast early, and it proved to be the best thing that could have happened.\n\nBut there's more to Curtis' story than that.\n\nBorn and bred a nerd, he spent his early years between Detroit, a city so nerdy that the word was coined there in 1951, and, improbably, Geneva, Switzerland. His adolescence and early adulthood were spent primarily between the covers of a book and indulging his nerdy obsessions. It was only when he found his true calling, as an actor and unintentional nerd icon, that he found true happiness. With whip-smart, self-effacing humor, Armstrong takes us on a most unlikely journey - one nerd's hilarious, often touching rise to the middle. He started his life as an outcast and matured into...well, an older, slightly paunchier, hopefully wiser outcast.\n\nIn Hollywood, as in life, that counts as winning the game.", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VP4FUQDPL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/b06225eb-a251-48fa-99a9-a41378000a46._CR0,9.0,156,156_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/personalization/ybh/loading-4x-gray._CB317976265_.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global_bluebeacon-1x_optimized_layout1._CB468670774_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91SHY7YOGgL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/merch/kcp/google-horizontal-iconv2._CB339188010_.png", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/Audible/Homestead/logo/audiblelogo.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/merch/kcp/apple-horizontal-iconv2._CB339188008_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars/ef0ebbe5-2cb6-4d44-bb09-214b5ee77816._CR45,0,409,409_SX48_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/merch/kcp/amazon-horizontal-icon._CB349235913_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81-ksgbzQAL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/aa3e6ac9-489a-483f-9d11-f6f3afe3671b._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg", "https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:143-0344025-3424961:6YGDX6JE93G91809C6Y2$uedata=s:%2Fgp%2Fuedata%3Fstaticb%26id%3D6YGDX6JE93G91809C6Y2:0", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81yQTpY6SyL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Events/2019/01112499/gw-armadillo-desktop-en/us_armadillo_gw_dt_swm_400x39_b_en._CB461720680_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Audible/en_US/images/creative/amazon/TM-153_HWR_AmazonILM_650x45._CB444537350_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:143-0344025-3424961:6YGDX6JE93G91809C6Y2$uedata=s:%2Fgp%2Fuedata%3Fnoscript%26id%3D6YGDX6JE93G91809C6Y2:0", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle-apps/buttons/sendMeLinkMedium._CB341573398_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/audible/2.0/buybox/prime/audible_logo_mark._CB272375087_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xPYauPWjL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/merch/kcp/windows-horizontal-iconv2._CB339188004_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61k5K7ivIFL._SX342_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71yXhhMsV1L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61k5K7ivIFL._SX342_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.amazon.com/Revenge-of-the-Nerd/dp/B073JSV9LB", "title": "Amazon.com: Revenge of the Nerd (Audible Audio Edition): Curtis Armstrong, Macmillan Audio: Audible Audiobooks", "meta_data": {"description": "Amazon.com: Revenge of the Nerd (Audible Audio Edition): Curtis Armstrong, Macmillan Audio: Audible Audiobooks", "title": "Amazon.com: Revenge of the Nerd (Audible Audio Edition): Curtis Armstrong, Macmillan Audio: Audible Audiobooks", "keywords": ",Curtis Armstrong, Macmillan Audio,Revenge of the Nerd,Macmillan Audio,B073JSV9LB"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.amazon.com", "summary": ""}
