We loved her romantic hairstyle so much we had to share how to get her look at home. Schwarzkopf celebrity hairstylist, Richard Collins, created Vanessa Hudgens\u2019s bohemian chic, dreamy look.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get Vanessa Hudgens\u2019s boho chic hair\n\nStep 1: Start with dry hair; work in a protective hair spray for hot tools protection and initial shine. Collins used Schwarzkopf styliste Crystal Shine & Hold Heat Protection Shine Spray throughout Vanessa\u2019s hair.\n\nStep 2: Leaving a few thick pieces around the face, use an inch curling iron to begin creating soft, deconstructed waves. Prep and finish the curls with a spray such as Schwarzkopf styliste Ultime Biotin+ Volume & Texture H2O-Free Hair Spray for added texture and hold.\n\nStep 3: Take the remaining pieces of hair left in the previous step and create a braid on either side of the face. Once complete, bring the braid to the opposite side of the face and secure above the ear with bobby pins. Repeat with remaining hair on other side of the face; creating a full braid crown. Apply a shine spray like Schwarzkopf styliste Ultime Crystal Shine & Hold Laminating Shine Hair Spray to secure the look.\n\nStep 4: Dust Schwarzkopf essence Ultime Diamond Color & Radiance Shine Boost Tonic over the hair for added shine and glimmer.\n\nDid you like Vanessa\u2019s look?\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://www.hispanaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disney_babble.png", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Valentines-boomark-craft-150x150.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/MULTIPLE-LOOKS-WITH-JUST-1-T-SHIRT-100x100.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/EASTER-EGG-WREATH-DIY-100x100.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image2.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Tshirts-Sharpies-Alcohol-150x150.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image-e1441113740133-883x1024.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/valentines-day-treat-for-kids-no-candy-150x150.jpg", "https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=XgDnm3XliMw&bids=357944.10025440&subid=0&type=4&gridnum=4", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image1-e1441113768370-897x1024.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image3.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Tshirts-Sharpies-Alcohol-100x100.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Mary-Poppins-Returns-free-printables-150x150.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/98E3FE49-36E4-424B-A71F-100EDF7ECFBF-300x200.jpeg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jeannette-headshot-300x300.jpg", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Free-mothers-day-printable-cards-1-150x150.png", "https://www.hispanaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/momdotme-top-50-blogger.png", "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/father-s-day-cards-150x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://hispanaglobal.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeannette Kaplun", "Claudya Martinez"], "canonical_link": "//hispanaglobal.net/how-to-get-vanessa-hudgens-hair-in-4-easy-steps/", "title": "How To Get Vanessa Hudgens\u2019 Hair In 4 Easy Steps", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Vanessa Hudgens looked beautiful yet she stayed true to her bohemian style during the 2015 VMAs.
