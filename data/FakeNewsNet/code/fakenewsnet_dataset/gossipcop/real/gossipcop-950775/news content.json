In fact, photographers have captured Drake, 31, courtside at Williams' matches since 2011.\n\nMichael Steele/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, the 23-time Grand Slam champion beat out Giorgi, 26, in the quarterfinals. After losing the first set, Williams was able to turn her game around and defeat Giorgi.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what I did,\" Williams said in a post-game press conference. \"After the first set, I just said, 'Let\u2019s go three sets.' I just kept fighting. I feel good. I feel like I did better today, I had to.\"\n\nStill, Williams said she's not getting too excited as she's still adjusting to tennis after returning from maternity leave.\n\nIn September, the tennis champion and her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, welcomed a daughter named Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. Three months later, Williams and Ohanian, 35, wed in an intimate New Orleans ceremony.\n\nDaniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"But this is only my fourth tournament back so I don\u2019t feel any pressure and have to win this,\" she added. \"I\u2019m here just to prove that I\u2019m back, and I feel like I\u2019m back.\"\n\nWilliams, 36, now heads to the semi-finals to compete against German tennis player, Julia Gorges. The two compete Thursday at Wimbledon.\n\nAhead of the big game in London, Williams admitted to \"Good Morning America\" that her body had changed after the baby.\n\n\"It wasn't as tight as I was used to,\" she said last month. \"I've played tennis for over 30 years, so I'm so used to [being] incredibly fit. But I realized everyone is different.\"", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/drake-wimbeldon-gty-thg-180710_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-wimbeldon-1-gty-thg-180710_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-wimbeldon-1-gty-thg-180710_hpMain_12x5_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-wimbeldon-2-gty-thg-180710_hpEmbed_2x3_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-wimbeldon-1-gty-thg-180710_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/serena-williams-drake-watches-win-wimbledon-tennis-star-56483951", "title": "Serena Williams' ex, rapper Drake, watches her win at Wimbledon, tennis star headed to semifinals", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
