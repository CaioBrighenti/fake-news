According to the insider, the Vampire Diaries alum\u2019s busy schedule played a part in the decision.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s filming a lot,\u201d the source says.\n\nA rep for Dobrev couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nE! News, who first reported the news, reports that there \u201chasn\u2019t been an official \u2018split\u2019 \u201d or any major fights between the two. According to the outlet, Powell \u2014 whose acting credits include Hidden Figures, Ride Along 2, and The Expendables 3 \u2014 is a \u201cvery easy-going dude\u201d who avoids drama if he can.\n\n\u201cThey are still seeing each other,\u201da source told the outlet. \u201cBut have cooled things off a little because of busy schedules.\u201d\n\nDobrev, 28, and Powell, 29, had been rumored to be dating since January after ringing in the New Year with friends in Texas. That same month, Powell was spotted at the Los Angeles premiere of Dobrev\u2019s film xXX: Return of Xander Cage, and they attended a Golden Globes afterparty together.\n\nHe was also at her La La Land-themed birthday party, where they recreated the signature pose from the Oscar-winning film.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed the two were dating after intimate photo booth pictures of them surfaced from Julianne Hough\u2018s stunning Idaho wedding to hockey player Brooks Laich on July 8.\n\nThey are so cute \ud83d\ude0d Nina Dobrev & Glen Powell \ud83d\udc95 pic.twitter.com/fxObr6GDEN \u2014 Nika (@NikaStrong) July 10, 2017\n\nThe couple recently attended the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and InStyle\u2018s celebration of the 75th Anniversary of the Golden Globe Awards on Nov. 15.\n\nThough Dobrev arrived after Powell, who walked the red carpet solo, the two met up inside the soir\u00e9e and spent the evening at each other\u2019s side, leaving in the same car at the end of the night.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Can Nina Dobrev Go from No Makeup to Red Carpet Ready in 90 Seconds?\n\nThe duo spent the Thanksgiving holiday apart, and Powell told PEOPLE at the event that he would be returning to his ranch in Texas.\n\n\u201cSometimes when your jeans get too tight, and the V\u2019s in your shirt get too deep, you\u2019ve got to go back to Texas,\u201d he quipped, adding that he\u2019d definitely be \u201ceating a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy body\u2019s going to come back looking very different,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say Texas is good for the soul, but not good for the body.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come back [to Los Angeles] for probably a couple of weeks, and then I\u2019m going to go back for Christmas and just decompress,\u201d he said. \u201cSpend some time on the ranch and try to be a man again. Sometimes L.A. it just pampers you too much. It just takes the masculinity out of you.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With reporting by MARIAH HAAS", "images":
