Of course, plenty were in it solely for a glimpse at the next adorable moments from Prince George and little sister Princess Charlotte (yep, we were part of that camp). No matter what the cause, everyone who tuned in no doubt received enough royal moments worth ogling over for years to come.\n\nOne aspect that quickly became a theme of last weekend\u2019s royal wedding was the subtle nods to two of the matriarchs in the life of the now Duke of Sussex. From Harry receiving the Queen\u2019s royal A-OK to keep his beard for the big day (shocker!) to the stunning floral archway of white garden roses (Diana\u2019s favorite) that heralded Meghan\u2019s walk down the aisle, there were countless ways these two women were foremost in the celebrations.\n\nThere was one not-so-obvious nod to the Queen that we didn\u2019t quite catch until well after the festivities were over. It seems Meghan, leaving no stone unturned, chose the Queen\u2019s favorite nail polish for her wedding day manicure. Royal revelers have long acknowledged Essie Ballet Slippers as the Queen\u2019s favorite hue\u2014it\u2019s a favorite of many Southern ladies too\u2014and now it seems the tradition is being passed on to the newest royal.\n\nThe pale pink perfectly set off the bride\u2019s three-stone engagement ring and Welsh gold wedding band, both of which are yet another special link between the bride, Princess Diana, and the Queen.\n\nWATCH: The $9 Nail Polish Queen Elizabeth Always Wears\n\nNow the countdown is officially on for the next royal wedding, that of Prince Harry\u2019s cousin Princess Eugenie and her fianc\u00e9 Jack Brooksbank. October 12 can\u2019t come soon enough.", "images": ["https://img1.southernliving.timeinc.net/sites/default/files/styles/landscape_3_2/public/image/2019/07/main/gettyimages-966517112.jpg",
