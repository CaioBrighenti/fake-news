That\u2019s when he presented Mike Myers\u2019 hilariously insidious character from the Austin Powers films.\n\n\u201cYes, Jimmy,\u201d he replied when asked about his (not at all real) congressional candidacy. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been reading the news? It\u2019s 2018. Evil\u2019s in right now. It\u2019s hip. It\u2019s like playing Fortnite while slamming a Tide pod and doing the Shiggy Challenge.\u201d\n\nWhen the late-night host admitted that he had no idea Dr. Evil wanted to run for office, he answered that he initially was after Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court but claimed that President Donald Trump called him \u201ctoo even-tempered\u201d for the gig.\n\nLater, Dr. Evil shared his campaign slogan: \u201cMake America Evil Again.\u201d He did this by presenting a red ball cap featuring the line. Obviously, this a nod to Trump\u2019s often-derided campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nSo, what is Dr. Evil\u2019s platform? If elected, the only flavor of Pringles will be Screaming\u2019 Dill Pickle (and the can will be narrower for eating un-ease). Donald Trump Jr. will be named Secretary of the Treasury, purely because Dr. Evil wants to poke him in the tummy, like the Pillsbury Doughboy. He also wants to increase the length of time required before skipping a YouTube ad from five seconds to eight seconds. Lastly, he also intends to legalize marijuana and make the kids song \u201cBaby Shark\u201d the national anthem.\n\nDr. Evil finished by performed the infectious song, despite Fallon's pleas that he stop.\n\nCheck out the entire incredible chat in the clip above.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nTaylor Swift Makes Impassioned Personal Video Message Urging Fans to Vote\n\nHow Celebs Are Encouraging You to Vote in the Midterm Elections 2018\n\nChelsea Handler Poses Topless While She Encourages Her Followers to Vote\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-11/1280_mike_myers.jpg?itok=VwYfXW_Z&h=c96d95be", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-12/serenagettyimages-1067076036.jpg?itok=7HUhtI0J&h=6e9ee960", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-11/1280_mike_myers.jpg?itok=h3EURpFl"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-11/1280_mike_myers.jpg?itok=h3EURpFl", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Scott Baumgartner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/mike-myers-revives-austin-powers-character-dr-evil-to-run-in-midterm-elections-evils-in-113118", "title": "Mike Myers Revives 'Austin Powers' Character Dr. Evil to Run in Midterm Elections: 'Evil's In!'", "meta_data": {"title": "Mike Myers Revives 'Austin Powers' Character Dr. Evil to Run in Midterm Elections: 'Evil's In!' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/mike-myers-revives-austin-powers-character-dr-evil-to-run-in-midterm-elections-evils-in-113118", "title": "Mike Myers Revives Dr. Evil ti Run in Midterm Election", "description": "The veteran comedian brought back one of his most beloved characters to poke fun at election season.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-11/1280_mike_myers.jpg?itok=h3EURpFl", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The veteran comedian brought back one of his most beloved characters to poke fun at election season.", "title": "Mike Myers Revives Dr. Evil ti Run in Midterm Election", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Scott Baumgartner\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/mike-myers-revives-austin-powers-character-dr-evil-to-run-in-midterm-elections-evils-in-113118", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-11/1280_mike_myers.jpg?itok=h3EURpFl"}, "description": "The veteran comedian brought back one of his most beloved characters to poke fun at election season.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Mike Myers, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Mike Myers, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjLEW7iFR5Y?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
