Pool/Getty Images\n\n\u2022 Oprah Winfrey began dating Stedman Graham in 1986, the same year her namesake show launched.\n\n\u2022 Winfrey and Graham got engaged in 1992, but ultimately decided against marriage.\n\n\u2022 Graham's suggestion that Winfrey run for president at the 2018 Golden Globes isn't the first time he's encouraged her to enter the realm of politics.\n\nInterest in media mogul Oprah Winfrey's hypothetical 2020 presidential run is surging.\n\nEven US President Donald Trump has weighed in.

Graham and Associates, has been with Winfrey for 32 years.\n\nHere's a look inside their relationship:", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a593f7b28eecc840f8b4b6f-1536-768.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a5627c6a75e20c5378b4584-750-562.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a593f7b28eecc840f8b4b6f-1536-768.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-relationship-oprah-winfrey-stedman-graham-2018-1", "title": "A look inside the unique relationship of Oprah Winfrey and her partner of 32 years Stedman Graham, who's said she'd make a great president for years", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-01-12", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-12", "news_keywords": "Features, Oprah Winfrey, Oprah, Stedman Graham, Relationship, \u00c1ine Cain", "sailthru.tags": "Features, Oprah Winfrey, Oprah, Stedman Graham, Relationship, \u00c1ine Cain", "description": "Media mogul Oprah Winfrey and her longtime partner, businessman Stedman Graham, first met in 1986 and have been together ever since.", "sailthru.description": "Media mogul Oprah Winfrey and her longtime partner, businessman Stedman Graham, first met in 1986 and have been together ever since.", "title": "A look inside the unique relationship of Oprah Winfrey and her partner of 32 years Stedman Graham, who's said she'd make a great president for years", "sailthru.verticals": "warroom, thewire, careers, thelife", "sailthru.title": "A look inside the unique relationship of Oprah Winfrey and her partner of 32 years Stedman Graham, who's said she'd make a great president for years", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a593f7b28eecc840f8b4b6f-1536-768.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a593f2c28eecc31008b4d34-1536-1152.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a593f2c28eecc31008b4d34-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Strategy", "sailthru.author": "\u00c1ine Cain", "og": {"title": "A look inside the unique relationship of Oprah Winfrey and her partner of 32 years Stedman Graham, who's said she'd make a great president for years", "description": "Media mogul Oprah Winfrey and her longtime partner, businessman Stedman Graham, first met in 1986 and have been together ever since.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-relationship-oprah-winfrey-stedman-graham-2018-1", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a593f7b28eecc840f8b4b6f-1536-768.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "\u00c1ine Cain", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-relationship-oprah-winfrey-stedman-graham-2018-1", "title": "A look inside the unique relationship of Oprah Winfrey and her partner of 32 years Stedman Graham, who's said she'd make a great president for years", "description": "Media mogul Oprah Winfrey and her longtime partner, businessman Stedman Graham, first met in 1986 and have been together ever since.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a593f7b28eecc840f8b4b6f-1536-768.jpg", "creator": "@ainecain", "site": "@bi_strategy"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "A look inside the unique relationship of Oprah Winfrey and her partner of 32 years Stedman Graham, who's said she'd make a great president for years": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515733200.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
