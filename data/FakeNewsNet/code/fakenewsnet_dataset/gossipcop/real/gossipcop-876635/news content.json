Few things feel as refreshing and revitalizing as getting a haircut, making it the perfect way to start the year fresh and feeling good.\n\nWe\u2019ve been searching high and low for hair inspo that will get those creative juices flowing and found 10 celebrity hairstyles we think you\u2019ll want to copy in 2018. Thanks to the magic of the internet, we can check out our fave celebs\u2019 latest hair changes as promptly share a photo with our stylist to recreate the look.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some celebrity hairstyles to channel in 2018.\n\n1Selena Gomez\n\nSelena\u2019s blonde bob has us reaching for the scissors AND the hair bleach. The soft edges give it a romantic touch that goes with her sweet aesthetic.\n\n2Emma Roberts\n\n2017 was a huge year for Emma Roberts\u2019 hair changes. From vibrant red to soft blonde, she captivated our hearts with her ever-changing looks. Her latest soft blond lob is one for the ages.\n\n3Kate Hudson\n\nIn one of the bolder moves of the year, Kate Hudson chopped off her hair into an adorable gamine pixie reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn. We\u2019d love to look this elegant!\n\n4Solange\n\nFirst she switched it up with gorgeous blonde dreds, and recently Solange debuted a gorgeous blonde afro that is making our hearts stop.\n\n5Lucy Hale\n\nWe\u2019ve always got hair envy when it comes to Lucy, but this blunt, ultra-short bob is so cute we can hardly resist it. It\u2019s chic with a slight edge, don\u2019t you think?\n\n6Ariana Grande\n\nDitching her signature dark ponytail, Ariana delighted fans with the arrival of long, soft silvery-grey locks that have us wanting to look like an elf from Middle Earth.\n\n7Vanessa Hudgens\n\nChopping hair into a bob seems to have been big this year, but the addition of long bangs makes Vanessa\u2019s hair a serious contender for 2018\u2019s hottest hair looks. We are getting major flapper vibes, and it\u2019s about time the \u201920s made a comeback.\n\n8Kim Kardashian West\n\nKim\u2019s ultra-long blonde hair made headlines for its daring shade and Cher-like length.\n\nBonus Kim K:\n\nIf you\u2019re not into long hair, Kim\u2019s latest icy blue blunt bob is to-die-for.\n\n9Taylor Swift\n\nCurls are back! And thanks to innovations in hair chemicals, you can get a perm that gives you soft, beachy waves every day.\n\n10Mandy Moore\n\nAs much as we love all of Mandy\u2019s various wigs on This Is Us, we\u2019re swooning over her sweet soft lob, courtesty of the Streicher Sisters. Adding a touch of color near the ends gives lovely contrast to her natural dark shade.\n\nWhich photo will you be bringing in to your stylist?", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/26165330/hairtools.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/23084530/dryshampoo.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/09142133/suavenaturals.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/21043406/hair1.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072559/avatar-k-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/16041406/mandymoore1.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/12/27025113/kim.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/09024814/millie1.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/09123454/bride-wedding-e1525894504587.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/12093820/klorane-dry-shampoo1.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/28002314/bronwyn.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/11/28122303/Fortune_5-e1543436931331.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/05103634/pink.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/29015652/katie_holmes.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/08091457/mixed-hair-the-blend.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/27104102/rihanna.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/23145137/braided-hair-e1524520344144.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/09/25125933/meghan-markle-hair.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/03051920/J-Law-hairstyles-e1507058375161.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/29104506/miley-hair-e1553881513559.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/24171514/thegoodstuff.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/08/08162020/nappily-ever-after-lathan.png"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/12/27025113/kim.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lourdes Avila Uribe"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/hair/top-10-celebrity-hairstyles-youll-want-copy-2018/", "title": "Here are 10 of the hottest celebrity hairstyles you'll want to copy in 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "beauty,hair,hair goals,hair inspo,hair style,haircut,Hair", "news_keywords": "beauty,hair,hair goals,hair inspo,hair style,haircut,Hair", "description": "We've compiled a list of the top 10 celebrity hairstyles we have a feeling you'll want to copy come 2018 \u2014 hair inspo at its best.", "og": {"title": "Here are 10 of the hottest celebrity hairstyles you'll want to copy in 2018", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/hair/top-10-celebrity-hairstyles-youll-want-copy-2018/", "description": "We're always searching for hair inspo around these parts.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/12/27025113/kim.png", "width": 575, "height": 704}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/hair/top-10-celebrity-hairstyles-youll-want-copy-2018/", "description": "We've compiled a list of the top 10 celebrity hairstyles we have a feeling you'll want to copy come 2018 \u2014 hair inspo at its best.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/12/27025113/kim.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/hair/top-10-celebrity-hairstyles-youll-want-copy-2018/", "title": "Here are 10 of the hottest celebrity hairstyles you'll want to copy in 2018", "description": "We're always searching for hair inspo around these parts.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/12/27025113/kim.png"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
