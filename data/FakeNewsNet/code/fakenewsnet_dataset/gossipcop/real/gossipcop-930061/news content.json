While there, he was approached by two \u201cvery nice,\u201d \u201cvery white\u201d young men who asked for a photo.\n\n\u201cThen they said, \u2018Our dad wants to meet you,\u2019 and I turned around and Paul Ryan was walking towards me,\u201d Rogen said. \u201cHe came over and grabbed my hand and I\u2019m just shaking his hand, I don\u2019t know what to do, and he said, \u2018Can I have a picture with you?'\u201d With Ryan\u2019s kids still present, Rogen said, \u201cNo way, man!\u201d and went to admonish him for the Trump administration\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop,\u201d
