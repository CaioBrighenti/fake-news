She would congratulate the singer on his singles reaching the top of the charts, excitedly talk about going to his shows and retweet his musings on naps or cereal.\n\nHowever, it was a post supporting \u201cJelena\u201d that really caught the attention of fans. In a reply to a now-deleted tweet sent out in 2012, Baldwin appears to defend the pop star\u2019s then-relationship with Gomez.\n\n\u201cShe is beyond flawless and he\u2019s ya know he\u2019s Bieber,\u201d Baldwin wrote. \u201cThey are the perfect relationship.. -___- forever alone.\u201d\n\nShe also reportedly wrote in a since-deleted tweet screengrabbed by Elle and other outlets, \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says but Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez together is the definition of a teenage dream.\u201d\n\n@Woahitsxmely seriously though.
