The rapper/producer, who was scheduled for an hour-long set, performed for less than 20 minutes before fans booed him off the stage, chanting for Yellow Claw, the next DJ, to take over.\n\n\u201cDue to technical difficulties beyond DJ Khaled and Insomniac\u2019s control, Khaled was not able to perform at his scheduled time on Sunday night at EDC,\u201d Insomniac CEO Pasquale Rotella said to Rolling Stone. \u201cHe arrived on time and ready to rock the crowd, but equipment issues delayed the performance. Even though there were technical difficulties, he still got onstage and showed his fans love.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, Khaled reiterated that his EDC set was compromised by technical issues. \u201cThey cut my time short and they had me backstage for a hour and half and the sound kept breaking,\u201d he captioned a video clip. \u201cThen I heard my fans and I said I\u2019m go out even if the sound cuts off and even if they cut my time short \u2026 I\u2019m here for my fans even if the sound man and promoter don\u2019t have there stuff together I forgive them thoe love is the [key.]\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tried to sabotage my sound,\u201d Khaled said in another post. \u201cI still stood on stage wit no sound, and when they got the sound to work they want cut my set short \u2026 I still rep for my people,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnyone else would walk off stage.\u201dThe rapper continued his rant in a second post to Instagram, claiming that he was \u201csabotaged.\u201d\n\nThey? Tried to sabotage my sound so many times THEY couldnot get the sound right on my set and i still stood on stage wit no sound and when they got the sound to work they want cut my set short but I still rep for my people anyone else would walk off stage .. i knew my California and Vegas fans was in the building .. THEY? DONT WANT US TO WIN SO WE WIN MORE FOR THERE HEAD TOP!!! It\u2019s all luv thoe .. love is the ?.. I forgive them \u2026 love is always the answer ! A post shared by DJ KHALED (@djkhaled) on Jun 19, 2017 at 2:17am PDT\n\nIn the second clip, Khaled tries to make up for the technical difficulties during his time onstage by playing 2Pac\u2019s classic \u201cCalifornia Love.\u201d \u201cThey want to cut my shit \u2026 but this is California,\u201d he says in the video. Las Vegas is, in fact, located in Nevada, as several fans were quick to point out.\n\nEarlier this year, Khaled also caught flack for a subpar performance at the Coachella Music and Arts Festival, where his sound was similarly cut off when he went over his scheduled time by several minutes.", "images":
