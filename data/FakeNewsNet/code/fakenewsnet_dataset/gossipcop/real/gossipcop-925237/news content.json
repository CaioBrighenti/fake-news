Lopez stars as NYPD detective Harlee Santos, while Liotta plays her boss, Lt. Matt Wozniak.\n\n\u201cI have enjoyed producing and starring in this beautifully complicated world and playing such an empowering yet flawed character \u2013 a woman, a detective, but, first and foremost, a mother,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cNow looking at it with a little distance, playing Harlee strengthened me and helped me grow into a more self-assured woman. It\u2019s crazy how some parts permeate your soul and change you forever and for that I am grateful. We crafted a poetic three-season arc on how her journey ends, which is true redemption. The way only Harlee could have done it \u2013 the hard way, the road less traveled. I thank NBC and all the talented actors, writers, crew and producers for going on this journey with us!\u201d\n\nThe cast also includes Drea de Matteo, Dayo Okeniyi, Vincent Laresca, Hampton Fluker, and Sarah Jeffery. Nick Wechsler is a recurring guest star. Showrunner Jack Orman and Lopez serve as executive producers along with Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Benny Medina, Ryan Seacrest, and Nina Wass.\n\nLopez will stay in the NBC fold despite the series ending, as she is a judge and executive producer on the competition series \u201cWorld of Dance.\u201d Lopez is also set to lead a live version of the musical \u201cBye Bye Birdie\u201d for the network, but it was recently delayed until 2019 due to her busy schedule.\n\n\u201cThis is one of our flagship shows and we\u2019re excited to share the final chapter with viewers who will be on the edge of their seats discovering how Harlee\u2019s story concludes,\u201d said Pearlena Igbokwe, president of Universal Television. \u201cIt has been a supreme pleasure to work with executive producers Jennifer Lopez, Jack Orman, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Benny Medina, Ryan Seacrest and Nina Wass.\u201d\n\n\u201cShades of Blue\u2019s\u201d 13-episode second season, which aired last spring, averaged a 0.8 rating in adults 18-49 and 4.3 million viewers per episode in the Nielsen Live+Same Day ratings. That rose to an average of a 1.4 and 7 million viewers after seven days of delayed viewing.\n\nPOPULAR VIDEO ON VARIETY", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/shades-of-blue-nbc.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hbo-chernobyl.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10331334cg-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/9245539a-cropped-e1562834428290.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/schitts-creek-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/big-little-lies-season-2-2.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/chloe-dan-2nd-photo.jpg?w=640&h=393&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tobey-maguire-as-spider-man-in-spider-man-2-66-960x639-115424-1280x0.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/big-little-lies-season-2-2.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nicholsfabian.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fjennifer-lopez-shades-of-blue-season-3-nbc-1202743696%2F&ct=article&lob=pmc-core&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202743696&comment_count=24", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/oscar-jaenada-shooting-hernan.jpg?crop=0px%2C283px%2C5472px%2C3084px&resize=450%2C253", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger-things.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/influencer-drama-2019-james-charles-olivia-jade-something-navy.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/st3.jpeg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/marc-guggenheim.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/91jwqitgssl._ux679_.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jakeg.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/shades-of-blue-nbc.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-episode-6.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2037-_toy-story-4_-cast-explains-why-forky-isne28099t-named-sporky-youtube-f09f948a.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-2-episode-6.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jacob-and-zach.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rexfeatures_10314204hj-e1561059816154.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/serena-williams-lose-wimbledon-ftr.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lion-king.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/sony-noise-cancelling-headphones.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bethany-hamilton-unstoppable-lieber-films.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shutterstock_editorial_10332596bb.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/theylive1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/shades-of-blue-nbc.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson", "Tv Reporter", "Https", "Twitter.Com Joeotterson", "Joe'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/jennifer-lopez-shades-of-blue-season-3-nbc-1202743696/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez\u2019s \u2018Shades of Blue\u2019 to End With Season 3 on NBC", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "The Jennifer Lopez-led NBC cop drama \"Shades of Blue\" will end after its upcoming third season", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "news_keywords": "Jennifer Lopez, NBC, Shades of Blue", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lopez\u2019s \u2018Shades of Blue\u2019 to End With Season 3 on NBC", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/jennifer-lopez-shades-of-blue-season-3-nbc-1202743696/", "description": "The Jennifer Lopez-led NBC cop drama \u201cShades of Blue\u201d will end after its upcoming third season, the network announced Wednesday.
