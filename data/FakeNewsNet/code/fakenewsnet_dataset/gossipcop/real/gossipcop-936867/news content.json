Ms. Markle's ring has been fashioned from a piece of Welsh Gold, gifted by Her Majesty The Queen. Prince Harry's ring will be a Platinum Band with a textured finish. Both rings were crafted in the Cleave workshop. The rings will be carried to St George's Chapel on the day of the Wedding by The Duke of Cambridge, in his capacity as Best Man.\"\n\nThe fact Harry will have a band is remarkable as not all royal men do\u2014though not entirely surprising. He was expected to wear his own, as a source told E! ahead of the wedding that Harry \"does want to wear a wedding band,\" unlike Prince William who \"prefers to go without [one].\"\n\nBefore the wedding, outlets speculated that Markle's ring would be yellow-gold to match her engagement band. A source additionally told E! that the ring would be made of Clogau-Welsh like Princess Diana's and Kate Middleton's bands were.\n\nPrince Harry, during the couple's first interview after announcing their engagement, explained he chose yellow-gold for Markle's engagement ring initially \"because that's her favorite,\" and included two diamonds from his mother Princess Diana's personal collection \"to make sure she's with us on this crazy journey together.\"\n\nHarry designed the engagement ring himself, which in addition to Diana's diamonds has a center diamond from Botswana. Court Jewelers Cleave and Company made the ring.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960071060-1526736176.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.742xh;0,0.0427xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960071060-1526736176.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.742xh;0,0.0427xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey", "News", "Strategy Editor", "Alyssa Bailey Is The News", "Strategy Editor At Elle.Com", "Where She Oversees Coverage Of Celebrities", "Royals", "Particularly Meghan Markle", "Kate Middleton ."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a20067835/prince-harry-meghan-markle-royal-wedding-rings/", "title": "This Is What Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Wedding Rings Look Like", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "This Is What Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Wedding Rings Look Like", "description": "Harry will also be wearing one, not just Meghan.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a20067835/prince-harry-meghan-markle-royal-wedding-rings/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960071060-1526736176.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.742xh;0,0.0427xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-05-19 01:25:25", "published_time": "2018-05-19 09:13:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2019"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960071060-1526736176.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.742xh;0,0.0427xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Wear Wedding Bands - Meghan Markle Royal Wedding Ring Photos, Designer and Details", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have just exchanged vows and have exited the church wearing their new wedding bands.", "keywords": "meghan markle, meghan markle ring, meghan markle wedding ring, royal wedding, meghan markle prince harry royal wedding, royal wedding ring, meghan markle royal wedding ring", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960071060-1526736176.jpg?crop=0.678xw:1.00xh;0.162xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture,celebrities", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-19T09:13:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960071060-1526736176.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.742xh;0,0.0427xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960071060-1526736176.jpg?crop=0.678xw:1.00xh;0.162xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "This Is What Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Wedding Rings Look Like", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526735580.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
