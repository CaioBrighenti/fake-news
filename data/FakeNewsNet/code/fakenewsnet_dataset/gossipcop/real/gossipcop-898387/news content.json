The 28-year-old actress and model was romantically involved with Harry from 2012 until 2014, when they split amicably. She was introduced to Prince Harry by Princess Eugenie, the youngest daughter of Prince Andrew \u2013 the Queen\u2019s third child. There were rumours that Harry might propose to Cressida before their split but the relationship ended and Prince Harry is now preparing to marry Meghan.\n\nCONSTANT MEDIA Cressida was romantically involved with Harry from 2012 until 2014\n\nCONSTANT MEDIA Cressida Bonas showed she had no hard feelings for her former flame\n\nAlso in attendance this evening were Carole Middleton and her daughter Pippa Matthews, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge.
