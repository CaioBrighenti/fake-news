Sources told TMZ that he stepped out on her with \"a famous country singer,\" though it wasn't specified who the singer was.\n\nWhen speculation swirled that the crooner was Cady Groves, the so-called \"other woman\" spoke out. \"This is too much. I'm going to have a nervous breakdown,\" she told In Touch Weekly (via Hollywood Life). \"Blake and Miranda are letting me take all the bullets. It's wrong,\" she fumed. Groves reportedly wrote angsty tweets after Blake and Lambert announced their divorce, which set tongues wagging. Groves said, \"I tweeted because it was the only way for Blake to hear me,\" she told the tab. \"I want to talk to him. If I could only be face-to-face with him, I have four questions for him. But he isn't talking to me.\"\n\nAccording to Radar Online, the alleged affair damaged Groves professionally and personally. \"All that crap that happened years ago ruined her career,\" her brother said. \"She lost her record deal. She lost an album she spent years on\u2026As far as what happened years ago, it was never what people thought\u2026She wouldn't intentionally be trying to stir up negative drama with Blake. That is why her career fell through. She wouldn't intentionally be trying to get attention from it when she's working her butt off to get her career back.\"\n\nThough Shelton did appear in Groves' \"This Little Girl\" video (playing the role of a greasy tow truck driver,) he denied all the allegations and even threatened to sue In Touch over the claims.", "images": ["https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-real-reasons-miranda-lambert-and-blake-shelton-got-divorced/-1485360528.jpg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-real-reasons-miranda-lambert-and-blake-shelton-got-divorced/-1485360528.jpg", "https://img2.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-real-reasons-miranda-lambert-and-blake-shelton-got-divorced/they-had-a-faulty-foundation-1485360560.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-real-reasons-miranda-lambert-and-blake-shelton-got-divorced/-1485360528.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/38545/real-reasons-miranda-lambert-blake-shelton-divorced/", "title": "The real reasons Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton divorced", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "//img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-real-reasons-miranda-lambert-and-blake-shelton-got-divorced/-1485360528.jpg", "title": "The real reasons Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton divorced", "description": "Country couple Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert wooed fans with their romance, but it all came crashing down in 2015.
