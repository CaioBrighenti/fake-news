{"url": "https://www.peta.org/features/kate-del-castillo-wont-wear-fur/", "text": "Mega-celebrity and devoted animal advocate Kate del Castillo, also recognized as one of the most influential and beautiful women by People en Espa\u00f1ol magazine, joins forces with PETA once more. Known for being brave and outspoken, Kate\u2014who comes from acting royalty in Mexico\u2014isn\u2019t one to shy away from fighting for what she believes in, and this time, she\u2019s taking on the animal-abusing fur industry to expose the suffering and death of animals. The actor braved frigid weather in NYC today to unveil her breathtaking ad. The tagline of the stunning image\u2014in which she poses in an icy snowscape wearing nothing but frost on her bare skin\u2014reads, \u201cI\u2019d Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur.\u201d\n\nIn our exclusive behind-the-scenes video, the international star explains that being beautiful has nothing to do with clothing and that beauty comes from within. She says, \u201cI think when you see yourself in the mirror and there\u2019s no regrets \u2026 that makes you a beautiful person \u2026.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unfair that foxes, minks, rabbits, dogs, and cats are bludgeoned, stomped, electrocuted, or gassed to death\u2014or even skinned while still alive\u2014so that humans can steal what rightfully belongs to these animals. As Kate says, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear fur to be beautiful.\u201d All animals, whether human or not, should be able to wear their own skins. You can help make this happen.", "images": ["https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Buddy-and-Cooper-396x240.jpg?20180405035015", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo-blue.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/THfS-Sunshade_RVSD-396x240.jpg?20190712063025", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kate-del-Castillo_RatherGoNaked-602x833.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/plugins/peta-optimization/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/VIV_ratinlab_SI_CR_COI_DB-396x240.jpg?20181220065050", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kate-del-Castillo.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo-white.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lonnie-Walker-Featured-Image-668x336-1562705453.png?20190709085053", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tiger-2076841_1920-198x120.jpg?20170620025417", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Unleash-2-668x336-1562862511.png?20190711042831", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/footer-ingrid-bg-600x320.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Michael-Keaton-Featured-Image-668x336-1562688484.jpg?20190709040804", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/PETA-Chilli-Circus-Featured-Image-668x336-1562001117.png?20190701051157", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-logo.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Unleash-2-396x240-1562862519.png?20190711042839", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/bunny.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kate-del-Castillo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.peta.org/features/kate-del-castillo-wont-wear-fur/", "title": "Kate del Castillo Bares It All: 'I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur'", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=421236952", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 5647744585}, "cf-cache-tags": "ccm-873625", "description": "Kate del Castillo takes it all off to raise awareness for animals.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate del Castillo Bares It All: 'I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur'", "description": "Kate del Castillo takes it all off to raise awareness for animals.", "url": "https://www.peta.org/features/kate-del-castillo-wont-wear-fur/", "site_name": "PETA", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kate-del-Castillo.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kate-del-Castillo.jpg", "width": 1250, "height": 773}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/officialpeta", "section": "Celebrities"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kate del Castillo takes it all off to raise awareness for animals.", "title": "Kate del Castillo Bares It All: 'I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur'", "site": "@peta", "image": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Kate-del-Castillo.jpg", "creator": "@peta"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "pubdate": 20180112}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/DGfUU1tuo2A?wmode=transparent&rel=0"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.peta.org", "summary": ""}
