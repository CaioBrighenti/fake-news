For this roundup, we\u2019re looking at important moments within the \u201cStranger Things\u201d universe itself, but you can read our breakdown of the best \u201980s movies references here.\n\nKeep scrolling for a look at 13 details you might have overlooked on the second season of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d\n\nLucas teased Dustin about not getting the princess when he played \u201cDragon\u2019s Lair,\u201d foreshadowing how Lucas would wind up with Max by the end of the season.\n\nNetflix Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) in the arcade.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just not nimble enough,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cYou\u2019ll get there one day, but until then Princess Daphne is still mine.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the season played out a small love triangle between Dustin, Lucas, and Max, but Dustin was left alone and without a love interest by the end of the season. He\u2019ll get there one day, right?\n\nIt was ironic to hear Murray Bauman say he thought Eleven was a Russian child, since Eleven was being used by Hawkins Lab to spy on Russians.\n\nNetflix Actor Brett Gelman played the conspiracy theorist.\n\nOn the opening episode of the second season, Bauman harasses Chief Jim Hopper about his theory involving a Russian child (Eleven) and an elaborate conspiracy with international consequences.\n\nBauman had pieces of the story correct, but the things he got wrong were telling.\n\nThe Russians are mentioned by various characters (often as a vague allusion to the Cold War) but no one knows how they connect to Hawkins Lab.\n\nNetflix Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) listening to a Russian man speak on season one.\n\nNo one seems to realise Dr. Brenner and Hawkins lab seemed to first plan on using Eleven to spy on Russians by showing her their picture and having her listen to them with her powers.\n\nEleven herself is likely unaware of what her temporary involvement in the Cold War was, given how limited her understanding of the world is.\n\nMike paused when he picked up his dinosaur toy because it reminded him of Eleven\u2019s first time in his bedroom.\n\nNetflix Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and the T-rex on season two, episode one, \u2018Madmax.\u2019\n\nAfter Mike continues acting out, his parents make him sell his old toys as punishment. He tells his mum they have \u201cemotional value,\u201d but gets dismissed.\n\nMike wasn\u2019t joking \u2013 some of the toys in his basement are direct connections he still has with Eleven.\n\n\u201cThis is my dinosaur, Roary, he has a speaker in his mouth so he can roar,\u201d Mike told Eleven back on season one.\n\nNetflix Eleven was unimpressed by Roary.\n\nIn that same season one scene, Mike told Eleven about Yoda and how he could move things with his mind. Later Dustin tried to get Eleven to make Mike\u2019s toy Millennium Falcon move.\n\nWill\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters\u201d costume was slightly different from the others, subtly signalling that he\u2019s not as well off as his friends.\n\nNetflix The boys on episode two, \u2018Trick or Treat, Freak.\u2019\n\nOn the first episode of season two, Joyce was sewing the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d patch onto Will\u2019s Halloween costume. When we saw them altogether, it was clear that Will\u2019s was a different colour and slight less \u201crealistic,\u201d likely because Joyce had to make more of it by hand.\n\nYou can already tell based on their houses and other mentions of family wealth that the Byers aren\u2019t on the same socioeconomic plane as Dustin, Lucas, and Mike\u2019s families. But this was a subtle way of showing how it affects Will\u2019s day-to-day life with his friends.\n\nWhen Eleven broke back through the Upside Down, she entered through the same Wall the Demogorgon used on season one.\n\nNetflix Eleven was trapped in the Upside Down temporarily after killing the Demogorgon.\n\nAfter season one, a popular fan theory posited that Eleven and Demogorgon were the same being, almost as if the Demogorgon was Eleven\u2019s alter-ego.\n\nBy mirroring the way the Demogorgon broke into Hawkins Middle School with Eleven\u2019s return, the Duffer Brothers might have been nodding to this theory.\n\nNetflix The Demogorgon on the season one finale.\n\nBy the end of season two, it\u2019s made clear that Eleven is definitely not a Demogorgon but instead is the only human (we know of) capable of keeping the evil Shadow Monster/Mind Flayer at bay.\n\nOnce again, though, a connection was drawn between Eleven and the new monster haunting Hawkins.\n\nNetflix The Mind Flayer, also called the Shadow Monster by the kids.\n\nOn the first episode of season two, \u201cMadmax,\u201d Murray Bauman tells Hopper a story he heard about a girl with \u201cpsionic abilities.\u201d One of the other cops asks what that means, and Bauman says \u201cpsychic.\u201d\n\nPsionic is the same term used in \u201cDungeons and Dragons,\u201d and Dustin repeats it when describing the Mind Flayer.\n\nNetflix Dustin shows this page to the rest of the group on episode eight, \u2018Mind Flayer.\u2019\n\nWe don\u2019t believe this is meant to spark new theories about the Mind Flayer and Eleven being the same person or being. Instead it signifies the importance of Eleven\u2019s powers and how her presence in Hawkins is clearly triggering a crossover between other dimensions.\n\nEleven opened the first gate into the Upside Down, and now the Mind Flayer knows she\u2019s capable of overcoming him (thanks to that epic finale showdown). Will they face off again on season three?\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nThe 13 biggest questions we need answered on season 3 of \u2018Stranger Things\u2019\n\n\n\nNow onto some significant Hopper revelations. His secret knock for Eleven spells \u201cus\u201d in Morse code.\n\nNetflix Hopper (David Harbour) hid Eleven in a remote cabin.\n\nHopper\u2019s relationship with Eleven was a tumultuous reckoning for him, given how he lost his own daughter before she could grow up to be Eleven\u2019s age. Since Morse code featured so heavily on this season, several people on the \u201cStranger Things\u201d subreddit picked up on the knock he created for their signal having added meaning.\n\nHopper would knock twice, pause and knock again, then do three quick knocks, which matches the Morse code for \u201cus\u201d (\u2022\u2022-/\u2022\u2022\u2022).\n\nHopper was reading a heartbreaking passage of \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d to Eleven.\n\nNetflix Eleven had a flashback to this moment on episode three, \u2018The Pollywog.\u2019\n\nEleven remembered Hopper reading to her. And not only was it the same book he used to read to his daughter, \u201cAnne of Green Gables,\u201d but the passage chosen for the scene was telling. It was a section of the book where Anne describes her state as a orphan to a friend.\n\nHere\u2019s the full section Hopper read.\n\n\u201cI would feel so sad if I was a disappointment to her \u2013 because she didn\u2019t live very long after that, you see. She died of a fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she\u2019d lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say \u2018mother,\u2019 don\u2019t you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits\u2019 end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate.\u201d\n\nWe saw Hopper reading \u201cAnne of Green Gables\u201d to his daughter when she was in the hospital back on season one.\n\nNetflix Hopper and Sara in the finale of season one.\n\nHopper was reading a different passage at the time, but the fact that he chose the same book to read to Eleven really hammers in how much of a surrogate she is for Sara.\n\nYet another link between Eleven and Sara comes from the blue bracelet Hopper fiddles with when disciplining Eleven.\n\nNetflix You can distinctly see Hopper toying with the bracelet on episode four, \u2018Will the Wise.\u2019\n\nDavid Harbour (Hopper) told INSIDER the story behind the blue bracelet. It\u2019s actually not technically a bracelet \u2013 it\u2019s an old hair tie Sara wore as a child.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see in the first flashback with Sara that she has her hair up in these little pigtails and she\u2019s wearing these blue hair ties,\u201d Harbour said.\n\nThe blue hair tie appeared multiple times throughout the first season, going all the way back to the very first episode.\n\nNetflix The hair tie as seen in Hopper\u2019s flashback on the season one finale, \u2018The Upside Down.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll notice throughout the series I will occasionally play with it like when I\u2019m talking to Eleven or going through a difficult time,\u201d Harbour said.\n\nFor a look at every time the hair tie appears, read our full breakdown of the meaning behind the bracelet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fiddle with it, almost like you would with a wedding ring when you\u2019re going through a divorce but you\u2019re still wearing it,\u201d Harbour said. \u201cIt\u2019s a constant reminder to him of his struggles and his guilt around not being about to save his child.\u201d\n\nAn even more dramatic connection between Sara and Eleven came on the season two finale when Hopper and Eleven entered the stairwell of Hawkins Lab.\n\nNetflix The staircase rail as seen on the season two finale.\n\nHopper and Eleven entered Hawkins Lab to close the gate to the Upside Down, and found Dr. Owens bleeding in the stairwell. The scene triggered a reminder of a quick flashback Hopper had on season one when remembering his daughter\u2019s death.\n\nOn the first season, Hopper was shown crying in the corner of the same stairwell we now know is inside Hawkins Lab.\n\nNetflix The handrails are an exact match.\n\nWhile Dr. Owens wasn\u2019t sitting in the precise same corner where we saw Hopper curled up, the handrails are a dead match. While it is possible the \u201cStranger Things\u201d crew just re-used a set for the flashback and for Hawkins, we believe this might be the first concrete hint that Hopper\u2019s past is darker than previously believed.\n\nFor one, we know Hopper used to be a \u201cbig city\u201d cop and he appears to have a deeper background in government and secrecy. What if Sara\u2019s death wasn\u2019t an unexpected illness, but instead was connected somehow to Hawkins Lab or another arm of the government?\n\nWe asked Harbour if he could tell us more about this connection between Sara\u2019s death in a hospital room and Hawkins Lab.\n\n\u201cHmmmm [laughing] I can not,\u201d Harbour said. \u201cBut yes, it is the same location. So that\u2019s interesting. Or it\u2019s a similar location.\u201d\n\nTo end on the happiest note of all, the Snow Ball was this season\u2019s best callback.\n\nNetflix Mr. Clarke hanging up decorations for the Snow Ball.\n\nEnding the second season with the Snow Ball was the happiest moment they could have given Mike and Eleven.\n\nRight before Mike kissed Eleven for the first time, he invited her to the Snow Ball.\n\nNetflix Eleven was pleasantly surprised by the kiss on the first season.\n\nMike was fumbling through trying to explain to Eleven how she could be a part of their family, but not like a sister.\n\n\u201cMaybe we can go to the Snow Ball together,\u201d Mike told Eleven on the first season. \u201cIt\u2019s this cheesy school dance where you go in the gym and dance to music and stuff. I\u2019ve never been, but I know you\u2019re not supposed to go with your sister.\u201d\n\nWhen she still didn\u2019t understand, Mike gave up explaining and just kissed Eleven.\n\nHopper making sure Eleven got one \u201cnormal\u201d night at the Snow Ball was a perfect way to tie up the separation between Mike and Eleven.\n\nNetflix Everything came full circle in the sweetest way.\n\nMike finally got to go to the Snow Ball with Eleven, even it was more than a year later. And now that Eleven is \u201cofficially\u201d Hopper\u2019s daughter, we hope they aren\u2019t separated again on future seasons.\n\nAnd remember Hopper\u2019s bracelet? Eleven is wearing it while she dances with Mike.\n\nNetflix Eleven wearing the blue hair tie on \u2018The Gate.\u2019\n\n\u201cAt the end of the series you\u2019ll see that Jim is not wearing [the bracelet] anymore, but I don\u2019t want to to get too into that because that\u2019s something we may talk about sometime in season three,\u201d Harbour said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ll delve more into in terms of Jim\u2019s daughter and him confronting this Eleven relationship and what that means \u2026 there\u2019s more to be revealed there.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
