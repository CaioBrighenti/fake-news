In 1990, there was little precedent for a series that probed so graphically and enigmatically into the darkest corners of the American psyche. By bringing an auteur like Mr. Lynch, a best-director Oscar nominee for \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d (1986), into the world of serials, the network ultimately seeded a revolution: The show used the devices of popular television to subvert it.\n\n[ Welcome Back to Twin Peaks: An Illustrated Glossary ]\n\nIts early episodes became appointment television before the Binge Age, but once its quintessential problem was solved \u2014 \u201cWho killed Laura Palmer?\u201d \u2014 the series got bogged down in a web of increasingly esoteric plotlines (deep space monitoring, for one). \u201cIt got very stupid and goofy in the second season; it got ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Lynch said in a phone interview, explaining that he was not involved with the show after Laura\u2019s killer was revealed in the second season. \u201cI stopped watching that show because it got so bad.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/arts/21TWINPEAKSJP1/21TWINPEAKSJP1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/arts/21TWINPEAKS1/21TWINPEAKS1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/arts/21TWINPEAKS1/21TWINPEAKS1-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/arts/21TWINPEAKS1/21TWINPEAKS1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Finn Cohen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/arts/television/twin-peaks-showtime-david-lynch-interview.html", "title": "How \u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 Got Lost, and Found Its Way Back", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-05-17T13:18:30.000Z", "modified": "2017-05-19T23:31:26.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/finn-cohen", "tag": "Twin Peaks (TV Program)"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005090351, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/3ae0754f-b4fa-5f11-9705-81940001f99d", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/c7faf1f3a0ea42f49566de1eb419f658", "description": "David Lynch is directing the new, 18-hour chapter of the series, which is beginning on Showtime and features much of the cast from 26 years ago.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/arts/21TWINPEAKS1/21TWINPEAKS1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Finn Cohen", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/arts/21TWINPEAKS1/21TWINPEAKS1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "TV,David Lynch,Kyle MacLachlan,Twin Peaks", "pdate": 20170517, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/arts/television/twin-peaks-showtime-david-lynch-interview.html", "type": "article", "title": "How \u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 Got Lost, and Found Its Way Back", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/arts/21TWINPEAKS1/21TWINPEAKS1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "David Lynch is directing the new, 18-hour chapter of the series, which is beginning on Showtime and features much of the cast from 26 years ago."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/arts/television/twin-peaks-showtime-david-lynch-interview.html", "title": "How \u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 Got Lost, and Found Its Way Back", "description": "David Lynch is directing the new, 18-hour chapter of the series, which is beginning on Showtime and features much of the cast from 26 years ago.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/arts/21TWINPEAKS1/21TWINPEAKS1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "From left, Naomi Watts, Kyle MacLachlan and Dana Ashbrook at the Beekman hotel in New York City."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005090351"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "arts", "SCG": "television", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/arts/television/twin-peaks-showtime-david-lynch-interview.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005090351", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/arts/television/twin-peaks-showtime-david-lynch-interview.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/arts/television/twin-peaks-showtime-david-lynch-interview.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494993600.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
