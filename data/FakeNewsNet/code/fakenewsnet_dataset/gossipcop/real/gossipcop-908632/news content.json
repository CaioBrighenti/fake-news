This got me to tour all around the world, support my family,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech. \u201cMost important, it showed me the true definition of what being an artist was.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the jump, I thought it was about the accolades and the cars and the clothes, but it\u2019s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for world to evolve \u2014 for the listener, the next generation after that,\u201d he added. \u201cHip-hop has done that for me.\u201d\n\nThe rapper concluded his speech with a shout-out to eight-time 2018 nominee JAY-Z, \u201cJay for president!\u201d JAY-Z gave a standing ovation for Kendrick\u2019s win.\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full Grammys coverage to get the latest news on music\u2019s big night.\n\nImage zoom Kendrick Lamar TIMOTHY A.

DAMN. beat out 4:44 (JAY-Z), Culture (Migos), Laila\u2019s Wisdom (Rapsody) and Flower Boy (Tyler, the Creator).\n\nThe win is extra special for K-Dot fans who watched as the lyricist\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly was snubbed in the album of the year category in 2016. Afterward, fans (im)patiently waited for his follow-up project and were not disappointed when Lamar, 30, dropped the 14-track masterpiece last April.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe initial goal was to make a hybrid of my first two commercial albums. That was our total focus, how to do that sonically, lyrically, through melody \u2014 and it came out exactly how I heard it in my head \u2026 It\u2019s all pieces of me,\u201d he told Rolling Stone last year.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Here\u2019s the List of Nominees for the 2018 Grammy Awards\n\n\u201cGoing from To Pimp a Butterfly to DAMN., that s\u2014 could have crashed and burned if it wasn\u2019t executed right,\u201d he added.\n\nThe 60th annual Grammy Awards, hosted by James Corden, were broadcast live on CBS from Madison Square Garden in New York City.", "images":
