The subject of Kourtney Kardashian having a fourth child has really been all the rage lately \u2013\u2013 as a highly debated topic on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, fans have naturally been back and forth about whether or not it\u2019ll actually happen (and who\u2019s gonna be the daddy for that matter). But Kourt and her signature wit shut down the rumors on Instagram over Thanksgiving this week.\n\nOn Nov. 22, sister Kendall Jenner posted a lovely photo and video round-up of the Kardashian\u2019s Thanksgiving celebrations on her Instagram. In the video clip Kenny posted, you can see Kourtney\u2019s hand on her stomach in a subconscious move that most soon-to-be mamas just can\u2019t help but doing.\n\nNaturally, it lead to some fan reactions. \u201cIs Kourt pregnant??\u201d One fan commented, reacting to the possible secret pregnancy. But Kourt swooped in with a comment of her own, unable to help herself from poking a little fun at the whole thing. \u201cNo, but how good does my arm look in that last photo?\u201d Kourt replied to the follower, alluding to the last photo in Kendall\u2019s set, where you can see Kourt\u2019s arm scooping up a plate during the big turkey din. And yeah, Kourt. Your arm does look pretty dang good.\n\nIt isn\u2019t surprising fans would catch something small and equate it to something big \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s what we do, duh. But Kourtney isn\u2019t exactly making the whole situation LESS complicated for us, either. In fact, on Thanksgiving morning, Kourt took to Instagram herself and made her feelings about Thanksgiving with her family known to the world. \u201cI woke up this morning in bed with my children, in the same house as my sisters (minus @khloekardashian \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude22i miss you), my brothers, the father of my kids, my mommy, my grandma, my nieces and nephew,\u201d the 39-year-old mom of three captioned an Instagram pic of herself, the kids, and the one and only Scott Disick. \u201cI feel beyond grateful. Happy Thanksgiving!\u201d\n\nThe sweet and sincere family photo is an interesting move on Kourt\u2019s part. Obviously, she and baby daddy Scott haven\u2019t been a couple for a long time now, but like we said, every five minutes on KUWTK, someone is dying for them to get back together again. And we can\u2019t say we disagree with the idea, especially with three kids under their belts already.\n\nNow that Kourt is (potentially) single again, anything could happen. Yeah, Sofia, we said anything!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/French-Montana-Reggie-Bush-Nick-Lachey.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kourtney.jpg?fit=200%2C111", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kourtney.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kourt-comment.jpg?w=750&resize=750%2C567", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-8.22.44-AM.png?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sofia-Richie-Is-Obsessed-With-Scott-Disick.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/khloe-jordyn-combine.jpg?resize=200%2C113"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kourtney.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lex Briscuso", "Nov"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/kourtney-kardashian-shuts-down-pregnancy-rumors-no-baby-no-4/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Shuts Down Pregnancy Rumors \u2013 No Baby No. 4!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "On Nov. 22, Kourtney Kardashian had to shut down some pesky pregnancy rumors after sister Kendall Jenner made a sweet Thanksgiving Instagram post with a telling \"clue.\" Click here for the details.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Shuts Down Pregnancy Rumors \u2013 No Baby No. 4!", "description": "On Nov. 22, Kourtney Kardashian had to shut down some pesky pregnancy rumors after sister Kendall Jenner made a sweet Thanksgiving Instagram post with a telling \"clue.\" Click here for the details.", "url": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/kourtney-kardashian-shuts-down-pregnancy-rumors-no-baby-no-4/", "site_name": "Life & Style", "updated_time": "2018-11-24T18:48:58+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kourtney.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "secure_url": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kourtney.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "kourtney kardashian kardashians kuwtk keeping up with the kardashians"}}, "article": {"tag": "Scott Disick", "published_time": "2018-11-24T19:23:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-24T18:48:58+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 741277405933843, "admins": 593583017, "pages": 229184533343}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "On Nov. 22, Kourtney Kardashian had to shut down some pesky pregnancy rumors after sister Kendall Jenner made a sweet Thanksgiving Instagram post with a telling \"clue.\" Click here for the details.", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Shuts Down Pregnancy Rumors \u2013 No Baby No. 4!", "image": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kourtney.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "creator": "@nikonamerica"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543087437.0, "source": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com", "summary": ""}
