I\u2019ve been performing with an awful pain due to my wisdom teeth and as advised by my dentist and oral surgeon I have had to have them imminently removed,\u201d the British pop star tweeted.\n\nI have been enjoying this tour so much and i\u2019m so upset that life has gotten in the way but hopefully i\u2019ll have a speedy recovery and make it back as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding xx \u2014 DUA LIPA (@DUALIPA) March 14, 2018\n\n\u201cI have been enjoying this tour so much and i\u2019m so upset that life has gotten in the way but hopefully i\u2019ll have a speedy recovery and make it back as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding xx,\u201d she added.\n\nAlong with the message, the singer \u2014 who won two of the top awards at the Brit Awards in February \u2014 also shared a selfie video, offering a glimpse of her swollen cheeks and an ice pack.\n\nImage zoom Dua Lipa Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nOn Sunday, Lipa hinted at her dental health with an Instagram photo of an oral X-ray, which she captioned: \u201cYour girls been blessed with 33 teeth. I\u2019ve always been an overachiever.\u201d\n\nThen on Monday, the star performed in Melbourne despite the pain in her mouth. \u201cMy face hurts but i\u2019m ready for a party. I\u2019m so excited nothing can stop me. Melbourne let\u2019s dance,\u201d she wrote ahead of the show on Instagram.\n\nThe London-born Lipa rose to fame in 2017 with her self-titled debut LP, which featured a string of hits, including \u201cHotter Than Hell,\u201d \u201cBlow Your Mind (Mwah)\u201d and her latest single \u201cIDGAF.\u201d\n\nWhen the singer gets back to work, she\u2019ll resume her Self-Title Tour: Asia in Hong Kong on May 1.
