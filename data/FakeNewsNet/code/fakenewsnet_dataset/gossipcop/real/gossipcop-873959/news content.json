Goodbye wizards:(\n\nGravity Falls is so much better, Cartoons are supposed to be the most popular genre on Disney Channel, and that's what Gravity Falls is, and it doesn't have a repetitive plot like Phineas and Ferb does. - nelsonerico6 I will really miss. Especially alex russo played by Selena Gomez. I will miss the whole atmosphere of waiting for a new episode. I shall cry on the last episode. I wish I was BFF with Selena because she is a great actor and singer but I prefer her as an actor.\n\n\n\nI hope the have another movie...\n\n\n\nLove you WOWP\n\n\n\nYou were the best show ever\n\n\n\nReally miss can't believe it is over.. I can still remember watching the first episode and being gripped and not being able to say Waverley properly when I told my friends about the amazing show Wizards of Waverly Place is a really good show. It even relates to Harry Potter a little. It has vampires, werewolfs, and a pot of monsters just like Harry Potter does. They both involve magic and are both about teenagers lives This show had best type of comedi. No adulteration no wacky jokes.

I LOVE THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY!\n\nSo sad it's ending... :'( It was very good, but doesn't compare to Gravity Falls as a matter of fact, but you'll have to go to Disney to watch it, since that's where they moved it, which was so dumb of them. - nelsonerica This is best show ever, it was so funny. I miss it so much, I miss Dylan and Cole Brenda Debby. I like Debby's new show but I miss suit life of Zack and Cody. This show didn't have Debby. This show was much better than that one. And gravity falls is terrible. - davdev17 THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY IS 1 OF MY FAVOURITE SHOW AND EVERYDAY I WATCH THIS SHOW FROM 50 TO 60, I WISH THAT I WOULD ALSO HAVE A TWIN BROTHER LIKE THEM... I JUST WANNA SAY 5 WORDS FOR YOU... ZACK AND CODY YOU ROCK You are WRONG, It's not the best show ever, the best show on Disney Channel as a matter of fact is Gravity Falls, Just watch it please, everybody loves it more than any other Disney Channel show. - nelsonerica Best Disney show ever V 341 Comments\n\nGood Luck Charlie Good Luck Charlie is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from April 4, 2010, to February 16, 2014. The series' creators, Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, not just children. Good luck Charlie is, in my opinion, one of the best shows on Disney at the moment. It's hilarious, it's something everyone all ages will enjoy! BEST SHOW EVER! Good lick Charlie is my favorite show! It is the best show. It should definitely be #1 I can't believe this is ranked 18! In my opinion, Good Luck Charlie is hilarious, enjoyable for all ages. It's a great show.

The series follows the adventures of Dipper Pines and his twin sister Mabel in the fictional town of Gravity ...read more. UM, HELLO?! Wake up from your coma people! Gravity Falls is Way better than Ant Farm and Jesse, and Austin and Ally!\n\n\n\nIt's the perfect setting for a kid around Dipper's age. He battles with his desire to be mature along with his awkwardness, something all kids will go through. His crush on Wendy is an amazing aspect that drives his desires to act more like a teenager, but he simply can't because it simply ISN'T that mature yet! It's just brilliant! (not to mention my favorite line when Stan says \"now you know about the birds and the bees\")\n\n\n\nNot to mention that the theme is way more intriguing than any Disney show on nowadays. It has plot lines way deeper than Disney shows will normally go, especially with \"Dreamscapers\" and \"Gideon Rises\". I mean, Austin and Ally rated better than Gravity Falls! That show is shit. The plot is always about either Austin or Ally trying to do some gig, but they run into trouble and fix it! It got boring quickly, ...more You got everything right. Gravity Falls is just outstanding. The mystery, the music, the characters and settings. It's the best Disney cartoon the channel has had in ages! WHAT!? This show is the best show Disney has right now! I remember when Alex Hirsch worked on the Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and voiced Captain K'nuckles, so when I heard the he was working on a new show, I had to take a look. I can't believe how amazing this show is. Animation wise, its perfectly done and the character design isn't to outlandish or too realistic. Now my take on the characters:\n\n\n\nDipper-A perfect representation of a 12 year old. He's logical and curious, but still trying to wrap his head around growing up. I'd have to say his entire attitude around having a crush on Wendy is way to perfect. always anxious and on the edge. Too good\n\n\n\nMabel- What can I say. eccentric, energetic, adorable and silly. But, seriously, she's the perfect type of person to be the twin of dipper. She's always really bright and upbeat. She can be pretty funny too honestly. Their personalities are so colliding, but they still remember their brother and sister. If anything in ...more This show is one of the best Disney Channel shows I've seen in years. I personally think even Phineas and Ferb can't beat it.\n\n\n\nThe best part is the cast of characters. Dipper is logical, Mabel is eccentric, Grunkle Stan (short for Great Uncle Stan) is a scam-artist but still warm-hearted, Soos is the strange but funny maintenance guy at Stan's Mystery Shack, and Wendy is the chill and awesome teenage girl who works at the Mystery Shack, too.\n\n\n\nThis show provides many funny moments for people of all ages, whether it be the fact that Mabel is eating hallucinogenic candy or there are gnomes barfing rainbows on your screen. I think this will be Disney's best show so far. I love it. There are a lot of mysteries and secret stuff in the show. It's funny and has a lot of references. It's mysterious and the whole show is a mystery, which you can solve if you follow all of the clues. I feel that this show will be like Avatar the Last Airbender on Nickelodeon, it will and has attract all sorts of viewers, not just kids. This is really good in the long run.

Phineas and Ferb are cool main characters, Cadence is however funny when shes trying to bust her brother laugh out loud and falling in love with Jermy, Perry aka Agent P is a pretty cool Platypus, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is funny too and always fail with his inators, Isabella is adorable and cute when she is in love with Phineas and all the characters are very creative! Even the quotes are funny, for an example \"Aren't you a little young to _____\" or \"Curse you Perry the platypus! \" I even enjoy the songs, my favorite song in there is Goochie Goochie Goo.

It should be at least the sixth best or something. I love this show. Jessie is how. And luke and dance so well. I wouldn't call it racist, I would call it stereotypical. That's why I'm not a huge fan of the show. - Absolite This show sucks. It's about a crazy lady women who gets thrown outta a taxi and finds a super nice penthouse to live in. But she has to take care of a bunch of crazy stupid spoiled brats who run around on stupid idiotic adventures with their fat butler who likes cheese and is lazy. And the crazy lady girl is from Texas. Out of no where. The crazy lady girl wants to be an actress but she sucks and cries and is sad. Then she struggles between her acting carrier and her flirty guy boyfriend who is weird and stupid and she breaks up with him like 20 times and almost gets married to someone but then says no and like this crazy lady girl is crazy. I am obsessed with jessie its the best show ever plus emma is so pretty. I wish it would actually show a little bit more of new york but because it only shows central park which gets boring.

The series was created by Kevin Kopelow & Heath Seifert, the writers and producers of the Disney Channel sitcoms Sonny with a Chance and Jonas. 11 Let me start out by asking a few questions regarding where this is placed. 1) Why is this higher than Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens, Cory in the House and basically every other show on this list. I Don't quite understand how this show made the top 10 for best Disney Channel shows ever.\n\n\n\n2) What was going on in the person's head who made this show? I don't not think that this show deserves to be this high in the list. I am not saying that you are not in titled to your own opinion I am just saying that I don't particularly like this show.\n\n\n\nI am not actually bothered by many of the actors, hence the word \"by many\". There is really only one actor I hate on this show. Laura Morano. In my opinion I just don't really like her. I love Ross Lynch, and I am okay with Raini and Calum. Laura in my opinion can't sing. Her voice is like she is talking with just more breath behind her voice. She always makes the weirdest faces when she sings and smiles way to much and way to ...more Okay for my last reply it's my own honest opinion and for those who may hate me or whatever and send out replies saying that I'm wrong well I don't care I can respect your opinions as best as I can may be for those who may possibly hate me and say those things maybe you should respect mine too. - Anonymousxcxc I must admit, I didn't like as much of the music and season 1. But then season 2 came, and BAM! Don't Look Down, You Can Come To Me, I Think About You, Finally Me- it trended on twitter! Austin & Ally is really one of the last good shows on Disney. There is so much character development- somehow this show also wounded up on the top 10 WORST Disney Channel shows, and one if the reasons is no character development which I don't understand. Ally overcame her stage fright, there is supposed to be an arc in which Austin starts writing songs, everyone (except Dez) is maturing just a little bit. It's not all rainbows and unicorns in it either- there is actually drama. And it has a purpose. It doesn't seem like it in the first episode- but they actually work to get where they are. As unrealistic as it is to be an overnight sensation, after all if that the team has to work. Unlike on Shake It Up, it might be just me, but lately it just seems like everything comes easy to them. On Jessie, I ...more I love it! It's so funny some people don't give it a chance! I also love Ross! He is so hot and he I love the music on the show I love this show especially AUSLLY I love that ally overcame her stage fright in season 2 because it really brought her out of her shell. Also Dez or Calum if you will is hilarious he always makes every moment funny, he is great at lightening the mood. I have watched every one of those 87 episodes at least 3 times and I love it.

Its formula is odd sometimes it wnats to be funny and sometimes serious and sometimes stupid. whereas Gravity falls decided to go for funny in its first season and you get warmed up for when it drills you with serious in season 2 star vs the forces of evil doesn't have a such secure formula\n\n\n\nIts still a great show to watch when gravity falls isn't on and I'm perfectly fine with gravity falls being cancelled if more shows like Star surface take its place V 40 Comments\n\nLilo & Stitch: The Series 16 It is funny and I could watch it 10 times without getting slightly bored!

I wanted to say that That's So Raven, Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens (and possibly Kim Possible) are some of the best shows Disney Channel has ever had. That's So Raven episodes can make anyone crack up and Hilary Duff's success outside of Disney really paved the way for other female artists like Miley, Selena, and Demi.

It was hilarious and I had to see more. And that isn't even ...more NOT A GOOD SHOW THIS SHOW IS BAD AND NOT FUNNY.

I especially enjoy this show, primarily as a dog person, but on the whole, I LOVED THIS SHOW! No - ElSherlock More like Dog with a Bad Show.

So dang funny - Cakecookiespie This was the funniest show ever on television. I would still watch it if it came on and I'm grown. Also good shows: boy meets world bug juice phil of the future life with derek kim possible. Lizzie mcguire was pretty good and so was American dragon. That's so raven suite life of zach and cody and hannah montana were disney's downfall. These days, everyone always love those teen shows like Kim Possible, Cory in the House, Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire, Life with Derek, The Suite Life of Zach and Cody, and Wizards of Waverly Place. I hate all of those shows, but this and that's so Raven were the only Disney teen shows I actually liked. Boy Meets World was okay. And that's right, hate me for it, but I think Hannah Montana is a stupid show. But of ALL of those Disney teen shows, THIS was THE BEST, and those who've watched this would probably agree with me too. - nallimcamybloc V 34 Comments\n\nLife with Derek 27 I have not seen that show in so long but I remember some and I loved it so please come back on disney... I love this show it is the best show in the world, I hope in real life Michael seater and ashley leggat will date and never brake up. I wish this show will never end. I love life with derek. I love life with derek - thedailypress Life with derek is the coolest ever show on dysney channel, if you want to laugh really hard while still watch a show with a storyline, watch this. I will tell you one thing you are bound to fall in love with either derek or casey and by the time the show ends you will roam around like a lost puppy...talking from experience :-) V 21 Comments\n\nMy Babysitter's a Vampire My Babysitter's a Vampire is a Canadian comedy horror television movie starring Vanessa Morgan and Matthew Knight. 28 I LOVE THIS SHOW IT IS BEAST THE BEST ON Disney I HOPE IT STAYS ON Disney THAT IS LIKE THE ONLY SHOW I WATCH!

From the start, Kickin' It had shown viewers the meaning of loyalty and friendship, clearly stating that this sitcom isn't just another one to laugh about, but has meaning and life lessons.\n\n\n\nLike other Disney shows such as, Hannah Montana, Suite Life, and Wizards of Waverly Place, the show is K+ rated humorous - obviously, this is Disney. The lines aren't too corny, and each episode will have you smiling until the end.\n\n\n\nKickin' It is not only humorous and meaningful, but also includes martial arts and displays of love interests. The most popular between Jack (Leo Howard) and Kim (Olivia Holt). With that, the show reaches out not only to boys, but to girls.\n\n\n\nIt's always enjoyable to watch these Disney kids (and their characters) grow up, even if they are just reading their script papers. Best one Kickin' It I say is Unique... Every Single Disney show is about friends and friends and friends, but this has friendship and determination on saving what they love the most. This is creative putting Disney-usual classic of friendship but original.. The actors are amazing and some episode might even inspire you to do something you love even if your amazing and even if your not... A lot of the top ten should not even be in the top ten... But for me Kickin' it is BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST T.V. sHOW Disney HAS TO OFFER... If this would go to Disney Channel AN INSTANT HIT I WILL SAY! Why are Kickin it Not in The top? Its one of The greatest Series on Disney Channel! The ideas are great, The actors are great, The story is great. It makes me want to start doing karate!\n\nSo please vote for one of The greatest Series of All time!\n\nAnd if anyone from Kickin it Sees This, then I just want to say that I would love too meet you in Real life!\n\nGreetings from Denmark!\n\nClara V 64 Comments\n\nDuckTales DuckTales is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation.

The story is so nice ad king Brady and boomer are so mad evil kings... I love this series...\n\nTill the end.. I agree. It's the best show ever. I am obsessed with it but It's to bad that the show aired late. I'm in my 20's but it's so hard not to love everybody especially king Brady. I love it forever and always. I love this show with all my heart! I might be just saying that I love this show because I think Mitchel Musso is SEXY but ever since they replaced him with Adam Hicks... I've stopped watching it. it's just not the same anymore. V 20 Comments\n\nA.N.T. Farm 32 I absolutely love this show! The show is really funny, and the actors are so cute and talented. I loved the show until the last season was aired.\n\nI mean...This show is stupid but so genius! I loved it!\n\nIt was so funny and it was one of my favorite disney shows, but the last season really disappointed me because it got really hard to watch.\n\nBut I still love the first two seasons This should not be number 20! At the worst I would give it a 5 maybe a 6 but not even close to 20. This show is the best show ever known. I love it because it is funny and because its about friendship. Its cool because they have really amazing talants. I love olive and flecher together they would make such a good couple I mean they have been friend more then chyna has with them. BEST SHOW EVER! This should be like number 2 it is a really good show and it deserves to b 2!

It was produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and created by Jeff Goode. 33 I love this but at my home Disney Channel does not come. But I love it. I watched it everyday. Their clothes are so cool. American dragon is the best show I have ever seen. It's so cool the way of turning in to a drago I like the idea of being able to turn into a dragon plus it's a real good show. This is the best show on Disney Channel. Jake gets to be a dragon and has the best life ever. I used to see the show all the time. They should make a third and fourth season. This is the only good show that Disney Channel has and ever did- and they canceled it. This is the best show I have seen from Disney shows. This show is funny and interesting. Some of the things can happen in the real life. People usually don't know about this show yet. IF they knew and watched, then I am sure that they will surely like and love this show. Please support this if you have watched this show.

And we say \"ARE CARTOONS GETTING WORSE\" well the answer to that is no. We all thought disney was the worst but now it is becoming the best. Disney is giving us AMAZING cartoons like this, Star vs the forces of evil, Gravity falls AND MORE! Another point for disney I just watched a few episodes today and can I say that it's amazing. However hopefully it doesn't get boring quickly like Phineas and Ferb because you know the creators of the two shows are the same. - Anonymousxcxc How is this show not # 1?

I am really sad that they moved it to Disney. Disney needs to bring it back the original channel! I'm sad because Wander Over Yonder does not get as much credit than it should. For one, the promos are terrible for this show! If you are not used to the show and take a first glance at one of the commercials, then I don't really blame you for not watching it! But still, I advise everyone to watch this great cartoon. If you are really into animation and love to study things like cinematography, than this is defiantly a great show to watch! It is so clever and has some great morals and jokes! It is basically a combination of Roadrunner and Coyote and Looney Tunes and space. This show defiantly in the style of older cartoons. The animation and voice acting is wonderful! This show will defiantly surprise you! Go watch it now and I promise you that you will not regret it! I am a HUGE die-hard, hardcore fan of this and Star vs. the Forces of Evil! This along with Star vs. the Forces of Evil and Gravity Falls are great shows - Stalin Wander Over Yonder is one of the best shows ever! Not only is this show great, but underrated too! Disney shows Gravity Falls more than Wander Over Yonder, and that show ended! This show is going to get cancelled because of Disney's stupid decisions unless the fans can support all the way! This show has memorable characters, interesting stories, has valuable morals, and a silly tone that will lift anyone's spirit! Not to mention how funny it is! I enjoy the voice acting and the animation is so creative, fun, and original!

Love all the characters and all the adventures they get into along with two amazing actresses: Landry Bender and Lauren Taylor! This is one of the worst shows ever, for all of you people that think this show is funny and cool, well it's not. Their basically copying the theme of girl meets world, except I don't think this show teaches lessons, but seriously a blonde girl with a dark haired girl with two friends that are boys, and the dude who wears hats all the time is basically copying farkle, and Barry, is like the Lucas. Sid is like the Riley, and the blonde girl is pretty much maya Okay you might think what you wanna think but I know this show better then you. You don't even watch it you called Shelby the blonde girl! This show teaches you about friendship. V 20 Comments\n\nHouse of Mouse 39 House of mouse is, in my opinion, the best Disney Channel show, partially because of the nostalgia I associate with it. This was my favorite show when I was younger, and, watching it again years later, I find that it's still entertaining. Also, having a show where every single Disney character, even the obscure ones, come together, while mixing traditional Disney shorts in is a great and creative idea. This show basically took all of the Disney films, brought them together, mixed in Disney shorts as well, and, in addition, made she show extremely entertaining for all ages. I love this show, and I wish Disney Channel would bring it back, because all of the other Disney Channel shows currently airing (except possibly Gravity Falls) pale drastically in comparison. This show exemplifies what a Disney Channel show should be: It should capture at least a majority of the magic presented in Disney films, as well as be funny, Disney-related, and entertaining, regardless of age. This is why The ...more Why so low? IT IS THE BEST DISNEY CARTOON SHOW EVER MADE! It brings every of your favorite Villains (My Favorite is Chernabog), Princesses (My Favorite is Ariel), funny ones (Iago), and every other characters from the old classic Disney animated films before this show was released. - asantalo I loved house of mouse as a child and now the only versions of mickey mouses you can watch is mickey mouse clubhouse which I think is rubbish. There should be more programmes around mickey mouse because that is what the whole Disney legacy was based on. As Walt Disney said, it all started with a mouse. A great show case of the old Disney shorts, but also adds some depth to classic Disney movies and chareters. It was always fun to see your favorite Disney charecters interacting with each other.

Totally not the \"kids show\" everyone thinks it is, it's got a great plot and character arcs that actually mean something. Even the filler is fun. Plus, they got the original Tangled stars back, Eden Espinosa is perfect as Cassandra, and Jeremy Jordan NAILED IT as Varian. Disney managed to make me feel for both the heroes and villains in this one, such a refreshing change from the typical black/white dynamic. I've seen the whole show like eight times and I can't stop writing fan fiction for it. Why is this so low? This show is AMAZING! - Nightingale9 This show is great. I give it a 9/10.

I'm only sixteen, but I can recall a time when the name Disney meant so much more than it does now. - Aceacles I think Walt Disney would be proud. Look at all the great cartoons. Kim Possible, Phil of the Future, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Recess, Boy meets World, and etc... That generation has passed though and it's different for this generation. I imagine there also be complaining in about 10 more years. When Austin and Ally is history and they come out with something even more silly. Just because I'm 13 I still love every mickey mouse Even Mickey Mouse Clubhouse? That show is nothing but a disgrace to all the Mickey Mouse shows, the characters act like polar opposites to those in the other shows, Donald is friendly in it, when he should be angry, and it makes parents think Mickey Mouse is for babies, when in fact it's for all ages, what a disgrace. - nelsonerica I love it and it is the best T.V. show every V 3 Comments\n\nThe Emporer's New School 49 Easily the most awesome and most underrated animated series in the history of T.V.. - Sharkuzco Yes so funny - Cakecookiespie Don't be so stuck up.
