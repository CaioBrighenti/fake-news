Ahead of the season (and possibly series) finale, Fox released a new promo for the rest of the season that offers a few clues as to what to expect. Here, THR breaks it all down.\n\nIn Wednesday's penultimate hour, FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate a youth-obsessed cult. But arguably the most important parts of the episode \u2014 certainly the most emphasized by the trailer \u2014 are the conversations the duo have about their own relationship. \"I believed we could live together, and I fled,\" Scully says. \"I believed I could protect our son, and I failed.\" Adds Mulder: \"I don't know if any God is listening, but I am standing right here.\"\n\n\n\nThe notoriously complicated couple (who broke up before the season 10 revival, but slept together earlier this season) even finally address their status head-on, when Scully questions Mulder's assumption that they're together. (Baby steps.)\n\nWhat do you want to see from the two remaining episodes?
