Photo by Kim Zolciak /Instagram\n\nJuly 17 (UPI) -- Kim Zolciak says she's \"almost fully recovered\" from her 2015 stroke.\n\nThe 39-year-old reality star told fans she's feeling \"great\" in a post Sunday, nearly two years after having a stroke at age 37. She opened up about the experience while sharing the warning signs of a stroke with her followers.\n\n\"As you know I had a stroke in Sept 2015,\" Zolciak wrote. \"Im so thankful for everyone's quick thinking. I've never seen doctors/nurses move as fast as they did the second I was wheeled in. I'm so thankful for my medical team.\n\n\"I have almost fully recovered (sometimes my tongue slips when I speak, and sometimes I have the word on the tip of my tongue but it just doesn't come out) but I feel great!!\" she said. \"I had my stroke at 37!! It can happen to anyone at any age! When in doubt please always check it out!!\"\n\nZolciak shares six children with her husband, NFL free agent Kroy Biermann, whom she married in 2011. She told Bravo's Daily Dish in September that having a stroke changed \"everything\" about her world view.\n\n\"My health definitely has changed my perspective,\" the star said. \"There's parts of me that are very thankful for my stroke and how I've evolved. I'm just not as attached to [questions like,] 'Where are we going to live? What are we going to do?' It doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"I just want to convey to people that it all will work out,\" she added. \"I'm always one of those worrywarts. It all has to be planned out; it all has to fit like a puzzle and if it doesn't, I'm all over the place. [But] it doesn't really matter.\"\n\nZolciak starred on the first five seasons of The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and appeared as a guest star in Season 9. She also stars with her family on the Bravo series Don't Be Tardy, which completed a fifth season in December.", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/related/7641562765490/2/v1.2/e35c017ccbc056d1fff2d90614170088/upi/Beyonce-Donald-Glover-attend-The-Lion-King-premiere.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/expand_gallery.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15071286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4621562907259/2019/upi/24864105aebfdedab071cd61925fb4dc/v1.5/R-Kelly-faces-federal-kidnapping-child-sex-racketeering-charges.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7191562865263/2019/upi/dd7c8c20a88724f042688075dfb2e55c/v1.5/Christine-Baranskis-Good-Fight-moves-from-streaming-to-network.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7061562941093/2019/upi/1cbd640a40d4930c5f604f7bcb58e1de/v1.5/Miley-Cyrus-on-her-unique-and-modern-marriage-Its-so-complex.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/i/3341500313608/2017/1/15003156056889/Kim-Zolciak-says-shes-almost-recovered-from-2015-stroke.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4691562947708/2019/upi/93608c5b7949951fad4700562606e8f1/v1.5/Oprah-Winfrey-opens-private-road-to-help-Maui-fire-evacuations.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-hqtKxhsRLFLuJ.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/3341500313608/2017/1/15003156056889/v1.5/Kim-Zolciak-says-shes-almost-recovered-from-2015-stroke.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2211562518286/2019/upi/c81a68a1a9a765aae722442766e0e2c0/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-July-12-Michelle-Rodriguez-Malala-Yousafzai.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/3341500313608/2017/1/15003156056889/v1.5/Kim-Zolciak-says-shes-almost-recovered-from-2015-stroke.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2017/07/17/Kim-Zolciak-says-shes-almost-recovered-from-2015-stroke/3341500313608/", "title": "Kim Zolciak says she's 'almost' recovered from 2015 stroke", "meta_data": {"description": "\"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" star Kim Zolciak told fans she's feeling \"great\" nearly two years after having a stroke at age 37.", "keywords": "Entertainment, TV, Kim Zolciak", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, TV, Kim Zolciak", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "\"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" star Kim Zolciak told fans she's feeling \"great\" nearly two years after having a stroke at age 37.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2017/07/17/Kim-Zolciak-says-shes-almost-recovered-from-2015-stroke/3341500313608/", "title": "Kim Zolciak says she's 'almost' recovered from 2015 stroke", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/3341500313608/2017/1/15003156056889/v1.5/Kim-Zolciak-says-shes-almost-recovered-from-2015-stroke.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "creator": "@littlemannie", "title": "Kim Zolciak says she's 'almost' recovered from 2015 stroke", "description": "\"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" star Kim Zolciak told fans she's feeling \"great\" nearly two years after having a stroke at age 37.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3341500313608/2017/i/15003156056889/v2.1/Kim-Zolciak-says-shes-almost-recovered-from-2015-stroke.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
