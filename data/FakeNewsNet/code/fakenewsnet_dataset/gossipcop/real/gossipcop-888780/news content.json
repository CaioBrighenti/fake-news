I was miserable, like inside and out, for four years of my life. But no one cared, because aesthetically you make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a very dark time for me,\u201d Clarkson added. \u201cI thought the only way out was quitting. I like wrecked my knees and my feet because all I would do is put in headphones and run. I was at the gym all the time.\u201d\n\nClarkson went on to say that she realised things needed to change around the release of her third album \u2018My December\u2019 in 2007. \u201cThere\u2019s a song on \u2018My December\u2019 called Sober. There\u2019s this line \u2018picked the weeds but kept the flowers\u2019 and I just live my life by that because you are who you surround yourself with,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was around some really negative people, and I got out of it because I had a lot of great people there too. It was a case of turning around, facing them and walking toward the light.\u201d\n\nClarkson has since taken to social media to clarify her comments. \u201cJust to clear something up. I wasn\u2019t ever miserable because I had to be thin. I said I was miserable & as a result I became thin,\u201d she tweeted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never contemplated suicide because of my weight.I said people had no idea I was unhappy oddly enough because I appeared healthy,\u201d the singer added.\n\nMeanwhile, Clarkson recently revealed that she refused a writing credit because she didn\u2019t want her name next to Dr Luke\u2019s. The producer (real name Lukasz Gottwald) has been embroiled in a legal dispute with Kesha since October 2014, when the singer filed a lawsuit citing \u201cmental manipulation, emotional abuse and sexual assault\u201d. He denies the allegations.\n\nIf you are experiencing problems, you can find help from suicide prevention charity SAVE.
