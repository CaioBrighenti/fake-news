It is by far the most fun of the bridal party\u2019s duties, but it can also be one of the priciest. Even if you\u2019re not heading out of town (and thereby skipping flights, hotels, and car restaurants), the cost of planning can still add up when you throw in dinner, drinks, transportation, and decor. Who foots the growing bill? We turned to the experts to help break down who pays for the bridal party.\n\nTraditionally, the only person who doesn\u2019t pay for the bachelorette party is the bride. Especially for an in-town party that\u2019s a single night out instead of a weekend away , the bridesmaids and other guests will often chip in to cover the bride\u2019s share, as well as cover their own costs. That\u2019s one upside to heading out on the town with a bigger group!\n\nFor a destination bachelorette bash , however, that rule doesn\u2019t usually apply. Since there\u2019s travel and lodging involved, plus multiple meals out, the bride will also contribute to help cover the expenses. You may all decide to treat the bride to one night on the town, but she\u2019ll have to take out her wallet to cover that hangover brunch the next day.\n\nWhile you\u2019re still in the planning process, keep the bride in the loop so she (and all of the attendees!) have an idea of how much they\u2019ll be expected to spend. Consider Airbnb over a pricey hotel suite, and look at options in a few price ranges to find something that works for everyone. As you\u2019re planning activities and meals, be sure to share pricing information so the guests can start budgeting. Make pricier activities (like a massage at a high-end spa) optional, and fill in-between time with low-cost or free choices (like a local hike or an afternoon window shopping that everyone can participate in.\n\nSee More: Broke Bridesmaid?

A slumber party with teen movies, popcorn, and junk food (plus the bride\u2019s favorite wine or cocktail ) is just as fun and will be much easier on everyone\u2019s wallets.", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5d03b35e5c6cf80a8a32cc0b/1:1/w_125/Stocksy_txp399d1559iWN200_Medium_1117809.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/59528e32a872b450628fc98c/1:1/w_767/GettyImages-475145775_v2.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/59725483c8e75a1eb133f8d7/1:1/w_125/SarahandAshwain20170712_03.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/59528e32a872b450628fc98c/master/pass/GettyImages-475145775_v2.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5cb8db56a93949e0035a7293/1:1/w_125/Girls%2520trip%2520the%2520movie%2520bahelorette%2520party%2520ideas.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/59528e32a872b450628fc98c/master/pass/GettyImages-475145775_v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/who-is-supposed-to-pay-for-the-bachelorette-party", "title": "Who Pays for the Bachelorette Party?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Planning a party can be costly, so it's only fair to ask who's got to shell out the dough!
