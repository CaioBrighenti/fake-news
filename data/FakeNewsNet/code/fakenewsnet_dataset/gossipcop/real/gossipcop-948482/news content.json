They just spent the last week in India, where they reportedly attended a pre-engagement party together\u2014and looked gorgeous in the process. Now they're in Brazil, where Jonas just wrapped his performance at the VillaMix Festival. Of course Chopra was in the audience, and she posted something to her Instagram Stories last night that all but confirms she's Jonas' biggest fan.\n\nThe Quantico actress uploaded a video of Jonas on stage, presumably after he finished a song, and she captioned it \"Him \ud83d\ude0d.\" To drive the point home further, Chopra's video zooms closer and closer onto Jonas' face. (Side note: I wonder what her favorite Nick song is?)\n\nSee, guys? Chopra and Jonas are just like any other maybe-couple. They cheer each other on at work, pose for pictures together, and hide from dozens of paparazzi\u2014ya know, normal people stuff.\n\nSpeaking of, there are a few cute pics from Jonas and Chopra's past week together: The first is from the night of Akash Ambani's pre-engagement party. The second is a paparazzi shot of them together in Mumbai.\n\nGetty Images", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b3906a7d70acf580cdaf2a7/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/PRIYANKA-NICK.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b3906a7d70acf580cdaf2a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/PRIYANKA-NICK.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b390d6169d57a644ef67026/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-986327276%252520(1).jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b390d620446b903a592f421/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-981700214.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b3906a7d70acf580cdaf2a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/PRIYANKA-NICK.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Ros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/priyanka-chopra-was-definitely-nick-jonas-biggest-fan-at-his-concert-last-night", "title": "Priyanka Chopra Was Definitely Nick Jonas' Biggest Fan at His Concert Last Night", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, everyone's favorite maybe-couple, are currently living it up in India, where Chopra attended Jonas' concert.", "keywords": "priyanka chopra,nick jonas", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Swooooooon.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b3906a7d70acf580cdaf2a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/PRIYANKA-NICK.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Priyanka Chopra Was Definitely Nick Jonas' Biggest Fan at His Concert Last Night", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/priyanka-chopra-was-definitely-nick-jonas-biggest-fan-at-his-concert-last-night"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Swooooooon.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b3906a7d70acf580cdaf2a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/PRIYANKA-NICK.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Priyanka Chopra Was Definitely Nick Jonas' Biggest Fan at His Concert Last Night"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
