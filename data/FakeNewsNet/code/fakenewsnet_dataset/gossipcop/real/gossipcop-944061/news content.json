The Brazilian supermodel recently sat down with Vogue to answer 73 Questions , one of which was, \"What's the most romantic thing that Tom's ever done for you?\"\n\n\"When he proposed to me, he made up this whole story [about] how my apartment was flooding,\" she answered in the video. \"And I ran over there to try to fix the situation. When I got there, the whole apartment had candles and rose petals, and then he went down on his knees to propose.\"\n\n\"And I'm like, 'Get up,'\" B\u00fcndchen continued, fake-yelling, \"'cause he just had surgery and had three staph infections. I'm like 'What are you doing?!' He's like, 'I gotta go on my knees.' I'm like, 'No, no, no! Get up, please.' So, and here we are.\"\n\nNine years later, B\u00fcndchen has some marriage advice . \"Keep it open and loving communication,\" she told Vogue . She also revealed some juicy secrets about Mr. Gisele B\u00fcndchen, who made a cameo in the video while practicing his golf swing in their backyard. Apparently, one thing most people don't know about the New England Patriots quarterback is that \"He doesn't like being barefoot.\" Another interesting tidbit? B\u00fcndchen taught him how to recycle. (Meanwhile, she says, he taught her how to say no.) As for what emoji \"best encapsulates who he is,\" the supermodel said, \"the one with the sunglasses, like cool and collected, you know?\"\n\nSee more: Tom Brady Wears \"I Heart Gisele\" T-Shirt to Celebrate Brazilian Valentine's Day\n\nElsewhere in the interview, the two had a slight disagreement about where they were going on vacation (B\u00fcndchen said Costa Rica , while Brady said Montana ) and were joined by their 5-year-old daughter, Vivian. While Vivian clung on to B\u00fcndchen's leg, the model said the best part about being a mom is \"the love you receive and the love you feel.\" (The hardest part, she revealed, is \"sleep deprivation .\")\n\nVivian had some facts to share about the B\u00fcndchen-Brady household as well, saying that she takes after her mom's love of pizza and that their rescue dog, Fluffy, \"likes juicy bones.\" Good to know!", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5ba505a5b2e7ef506361b855/1:1/w_125/image002.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b7c64288cd2b35c39f2606b/1:1/w_125/Katie%2520Kett%2520Photography-6.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b22755591b782231528b667/1:1/w_767/Screen%2520Shot%25202018-06-14%2520at%252010.00.07%2520am.png", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/580e60b4584381035c05bc5a/1:1/w_125/blogs-aisle-say-george-clooney-talks-marriage-secrets-to-amal-th.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b22755589832a25de29da16/master/pass/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-14%20at%2010.00.53%20am.png"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b22755589832a25de29da16/master/pass/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-14%20at%2010.00.53%20am.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/gisele-bundchen-vogue-73-questions", "title": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen Says Tom Brady Proposed to Her by Pretending Her Apartment Was Flooding", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a 73 Questions interview with 'Vogue,' Gisele B\u00fcndchen told the story of how Tom Brady proposed to her.", "og": {"description": "She told Vogue it was the most romantic thing he's ever done for her.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b22755589832a25de29da16/master/pass/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-14%20at%2010.00.53%20am.png", "title": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen Reveals the Unusual Way Tom Brady Proposed", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/gisele-bundchen-vogue-73-questions", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She told Vogue it was the most romantic thing he's ever done for her.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b22755589832a25de29da16/master/pass/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-14%20at%2010.00.53%20am.png?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Gisele B\u00fcndchen Reveals the Unusual Way Tom Brady Proposed", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/gisele-bundchen-vogue-73-questions", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "News", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,News"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/SynVdC540nw"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
