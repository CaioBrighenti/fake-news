Then as they started to sing the 1961 Ben E. King tune, Harry caught on and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s singing?\u201d\n\nWe don't know how Fev managed to pull off greeting Meghan and Harry with a choir singing their wedding song! THIS WAS AMAZING!! @BrendanFevola25. \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude4c#RoyalTourAustralia #RoyalVisitAustralia #harryandmeghan pic.twitter.com/AwxvVMibZn \u2014 Fifi, Fev and Byron (@fififevandbyron) October 18, 2018\n\nImage zoom REX/Shutterstock\n\nOnce he spotted the choir, he smiled, laughed and even danced for a few moments. Harry also placed his hand by his ear, encouraging them to sing louder.\n\n\u201cMuch better than the original!\u201d he joked, making a reference to the gospel choir, Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir, that sang the song for their May wedding.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how Fev managed to pull off greeting Meghan and Harry with a choir singing their wedding song! THIS WAS AMAZING!!\u201d tweeted the radio show.\n\nHarry and Meghan arrived holding hands to meet thousands gathered on the grounds of the city\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens on Thursday morning.\n\nThe crowd had a serious case of royal fever greeting the couple, with one girl in particular breaking down in (very happy!) tears after Harry gave her a big hug.\n\nImage zoom Chris Putnam / Barcroft Media via Getty\n\n\u201cPrince Harry just hugged me,\u201d 19-year-old India Brown told The Herald Sun. \u201cI\u2019ve loved that family since I was eight and I\u2019ve followed them around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said \u2018I know it\u2019s against royal protocol but can I please have a hug?\u2019\u201d Brown recounted. \u201cHe hugged me and I burst into tears. He just said \u2018Oh you\u2019re going to get me in trouble.\u2019\u201d", "images":
