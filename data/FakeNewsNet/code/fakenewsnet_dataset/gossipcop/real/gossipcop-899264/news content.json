Both Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan shamelessly fangirled over Taylor Swift, posting separate videos of themselves during the pop star's performance to social media later that evening.\n\nLohan shared a video of herself dancing near the front barricade to \"Shake It Off,\" even using the hashtag #Swifties to declare her part in the fandom.\n\n\n\nFrom practically the same spot in the crowd, Cabello shared an all-too-relatable video to her Snapchat story screaming in joy as she watched Swift perform. Cabello also shared a still photo, captioned, \"I cried.\"\n\n\n\nSwift closed out the star-studded night at Madison Square Garden, telling the crowd \"We'll see you on tour\" and reminding fans of the stadium trek she'll be embarking on next summer. Considering Swift's laundry list of A-list buds and the two unabashed Swift-loving stars at just one performance, this likely won't be the last we see of celebs showing their Swiftie side.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Camila-Cabello-02-jingle-ball-performance-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Camila-Cabello-02-jingle-ball-performance-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Stubblebine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8062881/taylor-swift-jingle-ball-nyc-performance-camila-cabello-lindsay-lohan-tweets", "title": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan Were Taylor Swift's Biggest Fans at iHeartRadio's Jingle Ball in NYC", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Taylor Swift's at Jingle Ball in NYC: Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan Fangirl During Performance", "description": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan are secret Swifties.", "og": {"title": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan Were Taylor Swift's Biggest Fans at iHeartRadio's Jingle Ball in NYC", "description": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan are secret Swifties.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Camila-Cabello-02-jingle-ball-performance-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8062881/taylor-swift-jingle-ball-nyc-performance-camila-cabello-lindsay-lohan-tweets", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8062881/taylor-swift-jingle-ball-nyc-performance-camila-cabello-lindsay-lohan-tweets", "title": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan Were Taylor Swift's Biggest Fans at iHeartRadio's Jingle Ball in NYC", "description": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan are secret Swifties.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/Camila-Cabello-02-jingle-ball-performance-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
