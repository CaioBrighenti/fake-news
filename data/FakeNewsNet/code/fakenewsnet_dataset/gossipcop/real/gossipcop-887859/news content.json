Woodley wore an eye-catching silver metallic gown while the fullback for the Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles opted for a navy blue suit.\n\nWoodley also posed on the carpet with the real-life inspiration for the film, Tami Ashcraft, who got caught in a hurricane while sailing across the ocean with her fianc\u00e9 in 1983. After the storm, she spent 41 days lost in the open water before being rescued.\n\nIn January, the Big Little Lies actress, 26, confirmed their relationship by sharing a photo on Instagram stories of her kissing Volavola. They had previously attended the Valentino Haute Couture Spring Summer 2018 show as part of Paris Fashion Week in France.\n\nThe actress shared another photo of her and her beau posing against a Valentino sign with the caption, \u201cThis date tho\u2026\u201d\n\nImage zoom Shailene Woodley and Ben Volavola.

Later that same day, the couple packed on the PDA by sharing a kiss on the sidelines during a team practice.\n\nThe duo reportedly met in Fiji where Woodley was filming Adrift.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Shailene Woodley Makes Her Relationship with Rugby Player Ben Volavola Instagram Official\n\nWhile Woodley has been linked to Divergent costar Theo James and musician Nahko Bear, the actress has not gone public with a boyfriend before. In 2014, she told Teen Vogue she had \u201cnot had a boyfriend in almost five years. I\u2019ve never been hooked up with anybody I\u2019ve worked on a movie with.\u201d\n\nThe following year she spoke to Elle magazine about what she looked for in a relationship.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re truly in love, for me, you\u2019re my lighthouse! You\u2019re somebody who holds me high, keeps me safe, you\u2019ve got my f\u2014ing back. You also love me whole, wild and free. You let me do me and I\u2019m gonna let you do you. And I\u2019ll be the home that you return to.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/shailene-woodley-ben-volavola.jpg",
