The Queen wore a royal blue skirt suit, and the King and two Princes were also sharply dressed.\n\nLike William and Kate, Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel are parents to two young children, five-year-old Princess Estelle and one-year-old Prince Oscar. (You might recall the family of four's adorably snowy Christmas card.) The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, however, are expecting another baby in April.\n\nThough this may be the two couples' first official photo together, it might not be their first time meeting. Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel actually attended the Duke and Duchess' wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWilliam and Kate's visit to Stockholm's royal palace is part of their four-day royal tour of Sweden and Norway, which began today. The trip is part of their duties as unofficial Brexit ambassadors, as they attempt to strengthen relations with nearby European countries before Britain exits the EU.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAfter the luncheon, the Duke, Duchess, Princess and Prince took a walk together through Stockholm's cobblestone streets to the Nobel Museum.\n\n\n\nThe change in scenery called for change in wardrobe. Middleton donned a green coat with a black fur trim and matching hat, gloves, pants and black ankle booties. The Crown Princess wore opted for an army green double breasted coat, oxblood leather gloves and a plum clutch and booties to match her rosy dress underneath.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeanwhile, the princes bundled up in scarves and navy coats.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe royal couples greeted fans on the street on their way to the museum, where they're slated to meet with Nobel laureates.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-kate-william-norway-sweden-tour-gettyimages-912192912-1517322927.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0988xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-kate-william-norway-sweden-tour-gettyimages-912192912-1517322927.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0988xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Gonzales"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a15921941/kate-middleton-prince-william-swedish-royals/", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Meet Swedish Royal Family", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Meet Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden", "description": "Two royal worlds collide.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a15921941/kate-middleton-prince-william-swedish-royals/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-kate-william-norway-sweden-tour-gettyimages-912192912-1517322927.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0988xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-03-28 09:19:30", "published_time": "2018-01-30 01:51:00", "section": "Celebrity News"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-kate-william-norway-sweden-tour-gettyimages-912192912-1517322927.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0988xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Meet Swedish Royal Family", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet with Sweden's royals during their royal trip to Stockholm.", "keywords": "duke and duchess of cambridge, kate middeton, king and queen of sweden, prince william, princess victoria sweden, swedish royal family", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-kate-william-norway-sweden-tour-gettyimages-912192912-1517322927.jpg?crop=0.6657142857142857xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest,princess victoria sweden,king and queen of sweden,kate middeton,duke and duchess of cambridge,swedish royal family,prince william", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-30T13:51:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-kate-william-norway-sweden-tour-gettyimages-912192912-1517322927.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0988xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-kate-william-norway-sweden-tour-gettyimages-912192912-1517322927.jpg?crop=0.6657142857142857xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Meet Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517295060.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
