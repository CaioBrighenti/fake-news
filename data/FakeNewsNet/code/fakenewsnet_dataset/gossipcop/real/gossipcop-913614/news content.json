Despite her natural radiance and beaming smile, the actress has to work hard to achieve her fitness goals. She recently took to Instagram to proudly show off how she did it post-pregnancy, captioning a photo with her trainer, Don Saladino, \"Turns out you can't lose the 61 lbs you gained during pregnancy by just scrolling through Instagram and wondering why you don't look like all the bikini models\u2026 10 months to gain, 14 months to lose.\" So just how did Lively manage to pull this off while shooting a film, traveling, and raising two kids?\n\nHer trainer shared the details of her fitness journey with E! News.\n\nShe ate high-quality food without going on a strict diet\n\n\"We did not put Blake on any crazy, strict diet. That's not who she is. She enjoys eating delicious foods just like anyone else,\" Saladino told E!. Instead of restricting her calorie intake, Lively focused on eating high-quality foods. Saladino explains that he creates a meal by looking at proteins, vegetables, and carbs, all of which are necessary in the three square meals a day he recommends for his clients, along with two shakes a day. She also allowed herself indulgences like sweets as part of her slow and steady approach to healthy weight loss.\n\nShe did resistance training with steady cardio\n\n\"The foundation of fat burning is weight training, and cardio is needed, but it's the sprinkles on the ice cream,\" Saladino says. With Lively, he worked on resistance training with high-intensity, slow-state cardio afterward, depending on her energy levels. According to Saladino, the last thing new mothers should be doing is high-intensity interval training. Instead, steady cardio will help burn the calories without depleting the body of energy.\n\nShe didn't put pressure on herself", "images": ["https://www.mydomaine.com/thmb/ql2HboV3p7yQ2KRdtt70To21QD4=/700x366/filters:fill(auto,1)/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__249574__blake-lively-pregnancy-weight-loss-249574-1518640125970-fb.700x0c-878d529f9c184220a35908d1954aedbc.jpg", "https://www.mydomaine.com/thmb/U3AGxefr90gQ9fUhQ27Sh1gJ0kw=/700x700/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__249574__blake-lively-pregnancy-weight-loss-249574-1518640181849-main.700x0c-6ccf29f04f2a446dbe59a95ee6c4c4d7.jpg", "https://:0"], "top_img": "https://www.mydomaine.com/thmb/ql2HboV3p7yQ2KRdtt70To21QD4=/700x366/filters:fill(auto,1)/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__249574__blake-lively-pregnancy-weight-loss-249574-1518640125970-fb.700x0c-878d529f9c184220a35908d1954aedbc.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christie Calucchia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mydomaine.com/blake-lively-pregnancy-weight-loss", "title": "How Blake Lively's Trainer Helped Her Look and Feel Her Best After Giving Birth", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Blake Lively always looks flawless, but she had to work hard to achieve her fitness goals, especially after pregnancy (here's how she did it)", "sailthru.tags": "mydomaine,wellness,self-care", "article": {"section": "Byrdie"}, "fb": {"app_id": 166036133580911}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Mydomaine", "url": "https://www.mydomaine.com/blake-lively-pregnancy-weight-loss", "title": "How Blake Lively's Trainer Helped Her Look and Feel Her Best After Giving Birth", "description": "Blake Lively always looks flawless, but she had to work hard to achieve her fitness goals, especially after pregnancy (here's how she did it)", "image": "https://www.mydomaine.com/thmb/ql2HboV3p7yQ2KRdtt70To21QD4=/700x366/filters:fill(auto,1)/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__249574__blake-lively-pregnancy-weight-loss-249574-1518640125970-fb.700x0c-878d529f9c184220a35908d1954aedbc.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@ByrdieBeauty", "title": "How Blake Lively's Trainer Helped Her Look and Feel Her Best After Giving Birth", "description": "Blake Lively always looks flawless, but she had to work hard to achieve her fitness goals, especially after pregnancy (here's how she did it)", "image": "https://www.mydomaine.com/thmb/ql2HboV3p7yQ2KRdtt70To21QD4=/700x366/filters:fill(auto,1)/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__249574__blake-lively-pregnancy-weight-loss-249574-1518640125970-fb.700x0c-878d529f9c184220a35908d1954aedbc.jpg"}, "lotame": {"tax2": "myd_self-care", "tax1": "myd_wellness", "tax0": "myd"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.13.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.mydomaine.com", "summary": ""}
