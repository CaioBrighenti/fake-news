Associated Press\n\nMalia Obama was just like any other freshman moving into Harvard University this week, except maybe for those Secret Service agents shadowing her mom and dad.\n\nMichelle and Barack Obama quietly moved their firstborn into a freshman dorm at the Ivy League school. The (arguably) most famous member of Harvard\u2019s Class of 2021 has arrived.\n\nMalia, who is 19, graduated last year from Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C., and took a gap year. She did an internship with film and TV production company Weinstein Co. in New York, according to People, and did some traveling, including a family trip to Bali this summer.\n\nThough she\u2019s certainly not the first celebrity to attend Harvard \u2013 Natalie Portman is a graduate \u2013 Malia\u2019s purposefully low-key arrival on campus managed to prompt a bit of buzz on social media.\n\nUnlimited Digital Access: Only $0.99 For Your First Month Get full access to The Sacramento Bee content across all your devices.

A reporter for The Boston Globe who saw her out and about town on Tuesday approached her and asked for an interview.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Malia told the reporter but politely shook their hand, the newspaper reported.\n\n\u201cAs a parent, we\u2019re well aware, but our son doesn\u2019t seem to be as concerned as we are,\u201d Shannon Whisenant, whose son moved into the same dorm as Malia, told the Globe. \u201cWe were kind of excited when we found out.\u201d\n\nLast year the former president told People the advice he gave his oldest daughter about college. He and his wife are both graduates of Harvard Law School.\n\n\u201cBe open to new experiences when you go to college,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t go to college just to duplicate the same experience you had in high school.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Malia\u2019s major will be.\n\nShe\u2019s not the only first daughter hitting campus this year. Tiffany Trump, 23, began orientation at Georgetown University\u2019s law school in D.C. this week.\n\nTrump, who is very active on social media, probably will provide updates.\n\nA post shared by Tiffany Ariana Trump (@tiffanytrump) on Jun 16, 2017 at 1:36am PDT", "images": ["https://ece-logger.nandomedia.com/analysis-logger/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=3181&contextPath=3181-3181&pubId=8&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=168914192&type=article&title=Malia+Obama+moves+in+to+Harvard%2C+with+a+little+help+from+mom+and+dad&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sacbee.com%2Fentertainment%2Fliving%2Ffamily%2Farticle168914192.html", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/968074018/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/apple-touch-icon-57-precomposed.png", "https://www.kentucky.com/living/family/j47b3d/picture142586509/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/20120619_Parenting", "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/logo.svg", "https://pics.mcclatchyinteractive.com/news/nation-world/national/ds9vec/picture168914162/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/malia", "https://www.sanluisobispo.com/living/food-drink/qyb414/picture223569525/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/a1%20berry.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pics.mcclatchyinteractive.com/news/nation-world/national/ds9vec/picture168914162/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/malia", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Gutierrez", "Jacquelyn Martin", "Asif Khan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/living/family/article168914192.html", "title": "Malia Obama at Harvard: Barack and Michelle Obama help daughter move in", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wps/build/images/sacbee/windowsmetro-144.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "sacbee_news", "title": "Malia Obama moves in to Harvard, with a little help from mom and dad", "description": "Arguably the most famous member of Harvard\u2019s Class of 2021 arrived on campus this week.
