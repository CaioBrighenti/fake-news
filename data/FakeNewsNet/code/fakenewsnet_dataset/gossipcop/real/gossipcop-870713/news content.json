Back in April, Kash Biermann was bitten by a dog, and now the Don't Be Tardy mom has confirmed that Kash just had surgery, as did her daughter, Brielle Biermann.\n\nShe shared the news on Instagram. \"[Two] kids same recovery room! It's all good though[,] had the best doctor! Had to take a pic for @kashbiermann and @briellebiermann for memory sake. Tonsils and adenoids removed!\" The Real Housewives of Atlanta mama said. \"Onward and Upwards.\"\n\nThe Daily Dish reached out for more information about the surgeries, but had yet to hear back as of press time.\n\nSpeaking about Kash's dog bite back on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Kim shed some light on Kash's April incident with a dog (clip above). \"I mean he was just unfortunately bit by a dog. He's an animal lover. Like I could see him being a vet at some point that's how much he loves dogs, cats. I can't. I'm not able to discuss it. I've been advised not to at this point.\"\n\nCheck out photos of the Biermanns, below.", "images":
