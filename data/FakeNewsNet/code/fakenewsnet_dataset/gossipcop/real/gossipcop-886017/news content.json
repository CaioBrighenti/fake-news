In that time, Team Flash\u2014including Wally () and Cisco ()\u2014have had to step up and protect the city in the hero\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cIn general, season three was about dealing with Barry Allen\u2019s actions and the repercussions, and this season is going to be more about Team Flash and their actions, and the repercussions to that,\u201d Valdes explained.\n\nOf course, this is still The Flash\u2014and that means there\u2019s still got to be a villain to defeat. But unlike seasons past, the new Big Bad won\u2019t be someone with powers that mirror Barry\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a different kind of Big Bad this year,\u201d Gustin explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had a speedster villain on the show, and this year we\u2019re going a different route. We\u2019ve got the Thinker.\u201d (While The Thinker has been four different characters in DC Comics lore, he\u2019s always had a technologically-derived ability of telekinesis, telepathy, and mind control.)", "images": ["http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fla323b_0187b-1-300x200.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-Childrens-Book-for-Handsy-Men-2017-kimmel-billboard-1548-376x250.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ed-sheeran-beyonce-grammy-tribute-2015-billboard-650-376x250.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Flash-Featured-11092016-970x545.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arjona-ricardo-511d70b986fa0-376x250.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/http-2F2Fo.aolcdn-994x120.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/960x0-1-376x250.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Tiffany-Haddishs-Ex-Husband-to-Sue-Over-Abuse-Allegations-in-her-Book-376x250.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/captain-america-376x250.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/170516-news-theflash-candicepatton-grangustin-news-300x200.jpg", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/TuRitmo1-3.png", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/76a4f28ff2032ac3d4389d0e0e291820?s=32&d=mm&r=g", "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rs_1024x759-161006175707-1024.Pitbull-Latin-American-Music-Awards.kg_.100616-994x120.jpg"], "top_img": "http://turitmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Flash-Featured-11092016-970x545.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tu Ritmo"], "canonical_link": "http://turitmo.com/flash-lightening-season-4-yes-really/", "title": "The Flash Is Lightening Up for Season 4 (Yes, Really!)", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "1MgodbrNC0f2lPSnSZ2kZ8mmhMhjofpNCTqgSwj8vjk", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "One thing you'll notice when you tune in to the season four premiere of The Flash?
