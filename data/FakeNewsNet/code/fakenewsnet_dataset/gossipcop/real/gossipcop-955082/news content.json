I think she\u2019s really warm, special, down to earth, truthful, giving, kind, supportive of women, genuine, smart, fabulous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss not being with her doing the next season,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a void. It\u2019s going to be a void for me.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Ramona Singer (left) and Carole Radziwill Charles Sykes/Bravo/Getty (2)\n\nAsked who she thinks should replace Radziwill, Singer said network executives at Bravo are \u201cpretty perceptive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey bring somebody on that some of the girls know,\u201d she said. \u201cI know I brought some girls to Bravo\u2019s attention. My faith is in Bravo, so I\u2019m sure whoever they pick will be great.\u201d\n\nRadziwill, an award-winning journalist and best-selling author who had been a Housewife since season 5, announced her departure from the show on Wednesday exclusively to PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cAfter six seasons on Bravo\u2019s RHONY, I have decided to return to what I do best \u2014 journalism and producing,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI am sure this does not come as a surprise to any of the viewers, all of whom have been supportive, encouraging, and kind. My original curiosity about reality television has waned over the years and I am focusing on TV and writing projects that better suit my more steady temperament.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have worked with amazing producers, made great friends, and I\u2019m thrilled to leave frenemies behind,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI will remember this entire experience with delight, humor, and a veracious accuracy. Next.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Real Housewives of New York City Go Makeup-Free For PEOPLE\u2019s Beautiful Issue\n\nIn RHONY\u2018s tenth season, airing now, Radziwill has had a pretty epic fallout

Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ramona-singer.jpg",
