On Friday, during a Q&A session after a preview screening of the film, Garner and Duhamel were asked how they\u2019d each handle it if their kids were to come out.\n\nAccording to People, Garner and Duhamel had no trouble fielding the question. \u201cI truly just want my kid to be happy and passionate about what it is that he loves,\u201d Duhamel said of his 4-year-old son (with ex-wife, singer Fergie). \u201cIf he came out he was gay, so be it, if that makes him happy. I truly believe that\u2019s what it would be and maybe it\u2019s because I waited awhile before I became a parent.\u201d\n\nMore: Everyone Lost Their Cool Over Jennifer Garner\u2019s Oscars Dress\n\nGarner \u2014 who shares Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 5, with ex-husband Ben Affleck \u2014 told the audience at the session that her kids already like to talk about whether or not they might marry a man or a woman. Said Garner, \u201cMy kids are growing up saying, \u2018Someday when I get married, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll marry a man or a woman. That door is open in a way that it never has been and they really do know, \u2018Oh this is so and so and this is his husband,\u2019 and \u2018this is so and so and this is her wife,\u2019 and that has completely been normalized, at least for my kids and hopefully will be for this next generation.\u201d", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WHEN_I_GET_HOME.jpg?quality=98&w=330#038;ssl=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/91jwqitgssl._ux679_.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_721076470.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1439766605-e1562875783520.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/behlaygzocjqd0gtv2jl.jpeg", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5951803ad-1.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/asgdar5bnayrxzwogqrq.jpeg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/my-autism-diagnosis-at-age-38-drastically-changed-how-i-parent.png?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shutterstock_10112916ms.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kourtney-kardashian-in-nothing-but-a-towel-selfie-ftr.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/oscar-jaenada-shooting-hernan.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/i-believe-in-letting-my-kid-swear-annd-my-husband-hates-it.png?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.sheknows.com&path=%2Fparenting%2Farticles%2F1138710%2Fjennifer-garner-josh-duhamel-kids-gay%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1138710", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/behlaygzocjqd0gtv2jl.jpeg?w=695&h=391&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/behlaygzocjqd0gtv2jl.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Mattern"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1138710/jennifer-garner-josh-duhamel-kids-gay/", "title": "Jennifer Garner & Josh Duhamel Talk Parenting a Gay Teen On-Screen \u2013 SheKnows", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "'My kids are growing up saying, \u2018Someday when I get married, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll marry a man or a woman...\" says Jennifer Garner.", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "author": "Jennifer Mattern", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Garner & Josh Duhamel on how they'd deal with their kids coming out", "url": "https://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1138710/jennifer-garner-josh-duhamel-kids-gay/", "description": "'My kids are growing up saying, \u2018Someday when I get married, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll marry a man or a woman...\" says Jennifer Garner.", "site_name": "SheKnows", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/behlaygzocjqd0gtv2jl.jpeg", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-16T21:34:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-10T00:20:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Jennifer Garner & Josh Duhamel on how they'd deal with their kids coming out"}, "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/behlaygzocjqd0gtv2jl.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SheKnows", "title": "Jennifer Garner & Josh Duhamel on how they'd deal with their kids coming out", "description": "'My kids are growing up saying, \u2018Someday when I get married, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll marry a man or a woman...\" says Jennifer Garner."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-sk-favicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521236040.0, "source": "https://www.sheknows.com", "summary": ""}
