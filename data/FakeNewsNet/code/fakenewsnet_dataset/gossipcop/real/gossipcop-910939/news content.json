Life breaks free. Life finds a way,\" Goldblum's Malcolm says in the trailer.\n\nThe film is scheduled for release on June 22, 2018.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15071286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4621562907259/2019/upi/24864105aebfdedab071cd61925fb4dc/v1.5/R-Kelly-faces-federal-kidnapping-child-sex-racketeering-charges.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7191562865263/2019/upi/dd7c8c20a88724f042688075dfb2e55c/v1.5/Christine-Baranskis-Good-Fight-moves-from-streaming-to-network.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4691562947708/2019/upi/93608c5b7949951fad4700562606e8f1/v1.5/Oprah-Winfrey-opens-private-road-to-help-Maui-fire-evacuations.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3181562849796/2019/upi/36d4ca61fb09350bdaaa89535b3155aa/v1.5/Real-Housewives-alum-Gretchen-Rossi-gives-birth-to-daughter.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/related/7641562765490/3/v1.2/4577a9562abd17376527482617ecf347/upi/Cosplayers-attend-Supercon-in-Miami.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-hqtKxhsRLFLuJ.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3581512702116/2017/i/15127026824432/v1.5/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer.jpg?lg=2", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2211562518286/2019/upi/c81a68a1a9a765aae722442766e0e2c0/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-July-12-Michelle-Rodriguez-Malala-Yousafzai.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3581512702116/2017/i/15127026824432/v1.5/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer.jpg?lg=2", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2017/12/07/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer/3581512702116/", "title": "Dinosaurs face extinction again in 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' trailer", "meta_data": {"description": "The trailer for 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' was released Thursday.", "keywords": "Entertainment, Movies, Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Pratt, Jeff Goldblum", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Movies, Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Pratt, Jeff Goldblum", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "The trailer for 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' was released Thursday.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2017/12/07/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer/3581512702116/", "title": "Dinosaurs face extinction again in 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' trailer", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3581512702116/2017/i/15127026824432/v1.5/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer.jpg?lg=2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "title": "Dinosaurs face extinction again in 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' trailer", "description": "The trailer for 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' was released Thursday.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3581512702116/2017/i/15127026824432/v2.1/Dinosaurs-face-extinction-again-in-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom-trailer.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
