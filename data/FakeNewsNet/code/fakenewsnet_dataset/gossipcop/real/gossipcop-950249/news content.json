I didn\u2019t know how to go forward \u2014 if I should cancel the festival, cancel this entire tour,\u201d Janet told the audience at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans on Sunday night (via E! News).\n\n\u201cI talked to my brother and we started to talk about my father\u2019s strength \u2026 We\u2019re a black family that came from Indiana and, we broke all kinds of records from all around the globe. That\u2019s truth.\u201d\n\nContinuing through tears, she said, \u201cMy father was a great man. My brother asked me, \u2018If he were here right now listening to this conversation, what do you think he would say to you?\u2019 and I think my father would\u2019ve said, \u2018Janet, please, finish what you started and I will be there with you every step of the way in your heart.'\u201d\n\nShe then dedicated the performance to her dad and said, \u201cLet\u2019s celebrate my father. My father would want to celebrate his life.\u201d\n\nJoe died in late June after suffering from pancreatic cancer, and he was buried in the same cemetery as late son Michael Jackson.\n\nJanet, 52, honored Joe on Instagram shortly after his death.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/janet-jackson.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/d29ea10c24a74df597d0ccaa32076ecd/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/janet-jackson.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/janet-jackson.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/07/09/janet-jackson-wanted-to-cancel-tour-after-joe-jacksons-death/", "title": "Janet Jackson wanted to cancel tour after Joe Jackson\u2019s death", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2019 NYP Holdings.
