Neither commemorated the special day on social media, but that\u2019s typical for the stars, who\u2019ve long preferred a low-key relationship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy. He\u2019s very nice,\u201d she told Vogue. \u201cI have someone being very nice to me.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at their relationship, from its beginning to the present.\n\nSummer 2017\n\nIn early August, Jenner was spotted leaving the Travis Scott concert afterparty at Avenue nightclub in Los Angeles followed by Griffin. Earlier in the evening, Jenner and Griffin attended the Kendrick Lamar concert at the Staples Center, where Scott also performed. They were joined by Kris and Kylie Jenner as well as Memphis Grizzlies player Chandler Parsons and Jenner\u2019s BFF Hailey Baldwin.\n\nWeeks later, Jenner was spotted on a double date with Griffin, Baldwin and Parsons. The foursome enjoyed dinner at Craig\u2019s in Los Angeles. After the meal, Jenner and Griffin and Parsons all hopped into the same car and left together. The following evening, they were spotted at Nobu with a group of friends, and the next night the two reunited again at Soho House in Malibu.\n\nAfter stepping out with Griffin three nights in a row, a source told PEOPLE at the time that the two were having fun together, but it was still very casual.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s seeing Blake romantically,\u201d says the source. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious. She has been in L.A. a lot lately, and is having fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWork will soon take over her life again, so who knows what will happen will Blake then,\u201d added the source. \u201cShe is having fun right now and that\u2019s all that matters to her. She takes her career very seriously and that\u2019s her number one priority right now.\u201d\n\nThough the duo began spending time with each other, Jenner was still keeping her options open, including staying in touch with rapper A$AP Rocky. \u201cKendall and Blake have been hanging out quite a bit and are having a good time,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cThey met in passing a few times and hit it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still talking to Rocky as well,\u201d the source added. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t the type to settle down or be a good boyfriend, so she\u2019s playing the field too.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Kendall Jenner Talks Her Sexuality, Stormi and Sitting Out Fashion Month\n\nFall 2017\n\nIn mid-October, the pair stepped out with Kylie and Scott for a special double date at Universal Studios\u2019 Halloween Horror Nights in Hollywood, an onlooker confirmed to PEOPLE. They were joined by Jordyn Woods, 20, and Baldwin.\n\n\u201cKylie and Kendall were both extremely loving and cuddly with their boyfriends,\u201d the onlooker said. \u201cBoth couples had their arms around each other, and the girls were really sweet with their guys. Travis and Kylie were especially cute and lovey-dovey. Kendall and Blake had a blast going through the mazes together.\u201d\n\nDays later, Jenner showed her public support for Griffin when she was spotted at the Los Angeles Staples Center where she watched him and the L.A. Clippers take on cross-city rivals, the L.A. Lakers. She was all smiles as she watched the game, appearing supportive as Griffin commanded the court with blocks, shots and one of his famous slam dunks. (The Clippers beat the Lakers 108-92.)\n\nThe following month, the NBA star joined Jenner\u2019s family \u2014 including parents Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner and sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kim Kardashian West \u2014 at her birthday dinner at Petit Taqueria in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cKendall was in a great mood,\u201d an onlooker told PEOPLE of the supermodel, who rocked $10,000 Saint Laurent boots at the bash, sponsored by Tequila Avi\u00f3n. \u201cShe and Blake hung out, but they also mingled separately.\u201d\n\nAnother source added: \u201cKendall is very happy with Blake. They started out more like friends, and then it was very casual. But it seems more serious lately. When they are not together, they keep in touch over the phone. Her family has accepted Blake. They are spending time getting to know him.\u201d\n\nFollowing her 22nd birthday celebration, Jenner once again cheered on Griffin courtside in early November at the Staple Center in Los Angeles, where she rocked a baggy white turtleneck, distressed denim jeans and a pair of $10,000 Saint Laurent knee-high boots.\n\nA week later, the cute couple was spotted grabbing a bite to eat at Sugarfish Sushi in Beverly Hills, and they were dressed in nearly identical outfits, according to The Daily Mail. Jenner wore a black sweatshirt with black leggings and white sneakers, while Griffin opted for a black hoodie, black pants and white sneakers. Following their meal, the couple exited the restaurant to find what appeared to be a parking ticket on the windshield of the Range Rover they arrived in earlier.\n\nAt the end of November, the pair made their red carpet debut when they both attended the premiere of The 5th Quarter in Beverly Hills, California, each posing for photographers separately. She showed off some skin a mesh leotard \u2014 which she paired with ripped jeans, a beige blazer and peach-colored bra. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star accessorized her look with black boots and a gold cross necklace, wearing her hair back in a loose bun to show off her smiling face and natural-looking makeup.\n\nGriffin, who wasn\u2019t by her side (she threw her arm around CEO of OBB Pictures Michael Ratner), dressed down his fitted royal blue suit with a grey crewneck sweater and white sneakers.\n\nBy early December, Jenner was cozying up in Griffin\u2019s jacket after she supported the Los Angeles Clippers power forward\u2019s stand-up comedy show for his Team Griffin Foundation in Hollywood. She joined a crew of Griffin\u2019s NBA friends for her boyfriend\u2019s performance and went for a business casual look in a lightweight Tom Ford long sleeve turtleneck, Tom Ford check wide-leg trousers and slouchy Tom Ford over-the-knee boots.\n\nJenner seemed to get a little chilly by the time she slipped out of the venue with Griffin close behind and threw her boyfriend\u2019s Ermenegildo Zegna coat (which has his name inscribed on the inside) over her shoulders. After posing for a few photos right before the show was set to start, Jenner took her seat with a group of basketball players to see Griffin take the stage. According to an onlooker at the event, \u201cKendall was enthusiastic throughout Griffin\u2019s opening performance, but in the middle of a set by John Mulaney, she and several of the other basketball players went backstage.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kendall Jenner and Blake Griffin Michael Stewart/Getty Images; Donato Sardella/Getty Image\n\nWinter 2018\n\nFollowing the holiday season and New Year, \u201cBlake and Kendall have been cooling off recently, but they\u2019re not officially broken up,\u201d a source told PEOPLE exclusively after Griffin was spotted out and about in Los Angeles over a weekend in January with a mystery woman.\n\n\u201cThey were definitely giving off couple vibes,\u201d an onlooker said of Griffin and the woman, with whom he was seen at Soho Malibu enjoying dinner and drinks with another couple. \u201cAt one point, she put her hand in his lap, where he held her hand there for about five to 10 minutes or so.\u201d\n\nAdded the eyewitness, \u201cIt was so subtle. They seemed very low-key together, and their holding hands looked entirely natural. They looked like they were really comfortable with each other, and they were definitely not calling any attention to themselves and the little bit of PDA that they shared.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of January, Jenner returned to her courtside seats at the Staples Center, where she appeared to be in good spirits at the event \u2014 smiling and encouraging Griffin as his team took on the Boston Celtics.\n\nHer appearance at the game came days before Griffin was traded to the Detroit Pistons \u2014 which may have taken a toll on their relationship.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, Griffin was sued for palimony by his former girlfriend Brynn Cameron \u2014 and Jenner was named in the lawsuit.\n\nIn the documents obtained by The Blast, Cameron, 31, slammed Griffin \u2014 with whom she shares two young children: son Ford Wilson and daughter Finley Elaine \u2014 alleging he \u201chad no problem\u201d trading her, \u201chis former fianc\u00e9e and mother of his two children, for reality television star Kendall Jenner.\u201d Cameron, a former basketball player at the University of Southern California, said Griffin \u201ccared more about the glamour of dating a Hollywood celebrity than the day-to-day responsibilities of being a father and a family man,\u201d according to the docs.\n\nDespite the suit, a source told PEOPLE at the end of February that \u201cthey\u2019ve definitely cooled off and are taking things at a slower pace, but not because of any particular drama.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe got traded and isn\u2019t local anymore, so they\u2019ve grown apart a bit just because of distance,\u201d said the source. \u201cThey\u2019re still involved.\u201d", "images":
