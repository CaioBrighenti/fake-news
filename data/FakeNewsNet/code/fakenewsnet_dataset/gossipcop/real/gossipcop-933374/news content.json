Exes Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard reunited at an afterparty for the 2018 Met Gala on Monday, May 7, where they not only exchanged pleasantries, but also posed for photos together!\n\nThe former flames, who dated for two years before breaking up in 2011, attended Versace\u2019s 2018 Met Gala Afterparty at the Mark Hotel following the event, which was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Bosworth, 35, and the Big Little Lies star, 41, were in good company, as Donatella Versace, Justin Theroux, Jared Leto, Black Panther\u2019s Chadwick Boseman and other stars were also in attendance.\n\nThe friendly reunion was a far cry from when the former Straw Dogs costars went to great lengths to avoid each other at the movie\u2019s screening in September 2011, by scheduling their arrivals an hour apart following the announcement of their split in July of that year. Still, a source told Us the breakup was \u201cvery mutual\u201d and the actor even sang Bosworth\u2019s praises in an interview while promoting the film. \u201cKate is such a great actress and she\u2019s so much more than a good-looking Hollywood starlet,\u201d he told BlackBook at the time. \u201cWe shared a really special experience on that film.\u201d\n\nThe Win a Date With Ted Hamilton actress shared the same sentiment, telling the outlet, \u201cHe\u2019s got this rare, wonderful control and stillness that you notice in a lot of old movie stars. I feel incredibly lucky to have had that type of man on this movie.\u201d\n\nThe Before I Wake star has since moved on from the Swedish actor. In 2013, she married film director Michael Polish, who she met on the set of 2011\u2019s Big Sur, in an intimate ceremony in Montana. As for the True Blood alum, he was previously linked to Alexa Chung in 2015.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-2009.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/andrew-bevan-kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-met-gala-2018-afterparty1.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1603px%2C842px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/andrew-bevan-kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-met-gala-2018-afterparty1.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/andrew-bevan-kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-met-gala-2018-afterparty1.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1603px%2C842px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/met-gala-2018-exes-kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-reunite/", "title": "Met Gala 2018: Exes Kate Bosworth, Alexander Skarsgard Reunite", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard, who dated for two years before breaking up in 2011, reunited at an afterparty for the 2018 Met Gala \u2014 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Exes Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard Reunite at Afterparty", "description": "Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard, who dated for two years before breaking up in 2011, reunited at an afterparty for the 2018 Met Gala \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/met-gala-2018-exes-kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-reunite/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/andrew-bevan-kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-met-gala-2018-afterparty1.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1603px%2C842px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/andrew-bevan-kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-met-gala-2018-afterparty1.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1603px%2C842px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Kate Bosworth Alexander Skarsgard Met Gala 2018"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "met gala 2018", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-08T17:34:28+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard, who dated for two years before breaking up in 2011, reunited at an afterparty for the 2018 Met Gala \u2014 find out more", "title": "Exes Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard Reunite at Afterparty", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/andrew-bevan-kate-bosworth-alexander-skarsgard-met-gala-2018-afterparty1.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1603px%2C842px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525800868.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
