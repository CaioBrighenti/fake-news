The 31-year-old actor shocked everyone when he shared a throwback picture of his younger self wearing a black-and-white jumpsuit in a mugshot.\n\nNot looking remorseful, he was smirking a bit to the camera. And unlike most mugshots where the culprits look terrible, Hammer still looked handsome and well-groomed. He cheekily captioned the post, \"It might not be Thursday, but this throwback seems worth it... #godblesstexas.\"\n\nBut before you despise him, you better learn the facts about his arrest. The \"Call Me by Your Name\" star was 25 when he was arrested for possession of marijuana in November 2011 in Sierra Blanca, Texas.\n\nAccording to a police report obtained by TMZ, authorities found pot cookies and a brownie during the bust. However, prosecutors dropped the case because the Golden Globe-nominated actor only had a very small amount of actual marijuana. Still, the alleged .02 ounces of weed he possessed was enough to make him spend a day in jail, before paying $1,000 bond.\n\nThe arrest happened just months before Hammer was nominated for an SAG Award for his portrayal of Clyde Tolson in biopic \"J. Edgar\" which was directed by %cClint Eastwood%. Now, he is widely known for his performance in gay romance film \"Call Me by Your Name\", which earned him nominations at the Critics' Choice Awards, the Independent Spirit Awards and the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nHis arrest and career aside, Hammer is of a well-off family. His father Michael Armand Hammer owns several businesses, including Knoedler Publishing and film/television production company Armand Hammer Productions, while his mother Dru Ann is a former loan officer. His paternal great-grandfather was oil tycoon and philanthropist Armand Hammer.\n\nHe went to Grace Christian Academy in the Cayman Islands, a school founded by his father. He admitted that his parents disowned him when he decided to leave school and take up acting, but have since become supportive of him and proud of his work.\n\nHe has been married to television personality %cElizabeth Chambers% since 2010. They have two children, daughter Harper (born in 2014) and son Ford (born in 2017).", "images": ["https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x400/2019/07/12/00138850.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/assets/img/logo.png", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138887.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2018/12/14/00130059.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138863.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138847.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2018/07/18/00123188.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/armie-hammer-shares-his-mugshot.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138846.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138836.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138860.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138851.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138830.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138845.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138818.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2018/11/14/00128721.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2018/11/16/00128850.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/12/00138834.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2018/05/21/00120389.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/160x117/2019/07/13/00138865.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/armie-hammer-shares-his-mugshot.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00118120.html", "title": "Dark Past!
