Does it count as a revival if it\u2019s only been off the air for like three years? Is hooking up with one of your roommates always bad? I am here to answer one of these questions.\n\n\n\nLast month, Parks and Recreation stars Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman floated the idea of bringing back the Emmy-nominated sitcom, which ran for seven seasons between 2009 and 2015, \u00e0 la Will & Grace, Fuller House, and Canceledanne.\n\nChris Pratt, Jezebel\u2019s canon fourth-tier famous Chris, was asked about his interest in doing said hypothetical revival while on the red carpet for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\u2019s L.A. premiere Wednesday night. He said he\u2019d \u201clove\u201d to, if he\u2019s around.\n\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m in town, yeah, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d he told E! News reporter Will Marfuggi. \u201cIt films, like, 10 minutes from my house, so that would be dope. I mean, you can\u2019t do Parks and Rec without Andy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI miss Andy,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love it. I know I would do it.\u201d\n\nAnd there you have it, the answer to all (one) of your (my) questions. Chris Pratt would participate in a Parks and Recreation revival.", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--a2KTbmop--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/gzyg2u8ecbpngnafgkvp.jpg", "https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=5zq9nmk&ct=0:ngtk7da&fmt=3", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--gi17cxM0--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/gzyg2u8ecbpngnafgkvp.jpg", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--bCR4geF---/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/xfjn66ikd7juv2oo2b0l.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6770184&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/activity;dc_iu=/4246/DFP_Audience_Pixel;dc_seg=22540930;blog=themusejezebel;ord=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--gi17cxM0--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/gzyg2u8ecbpngnafgkvp.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Harron Walker", "About The Author", "Contributor"], "canonical_link": "https://themuse.jezebel.com/lesser-chris-says-a-parks-and-recreation-revival-would-1826828672", "title": "Chris Pratt Wants a Parks and Recreation Reboot", "meta_data": {"dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-edd40da2ae92de7cb0979025edd33027.css", "google-site-verification": "P13oAn8o8LB6FVCJWKsHWXvxfbR-SJrmvox6EgULpUs", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7jeoLBLe--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/auj4p7qsrkznkdstuufo.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--vzJKsIQQ--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/auj4p7qsrkznkdstuufo.png", "keywords": "Chris Pratt, Parks and recreation, parks and rec, jurassic world, The Muse", "news_keywords": "Chris Pratt, Parks and recreation, parks and rec, jurassic world, The Muse", "twitter": {"url": "https://themuse.jezebel.com/lesser-chris-says-a-parks-and-recreation-revival-would-1826828672", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--gi17cxM0--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/gzyg2u8ecbpngnafgkvp.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@jezebel", "title": "Lesser Chris Says a Parks and Recreation\u00a0Revival Would Be 'Dope'", "description": "Would Chris Pratt participate in a Parks and Recreation revival?
