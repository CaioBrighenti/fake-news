{"url": "https://studybreaks.com/culture/music/christina-aguilera/", "text": "Christina Aguilera, the woman who made ass-less chaps a trend, shocked her fans and those who have seen her perform throughout the past two decades, by posing completely barefaced on the cover of Paper Magazine. Saying how she is at a new point in her career where she wants to \u201cstrip it all back,\u201d Aguilera starts this new phase by posing without makeup, a look that she is definitely not known for.\n\nWhen most people think of Aguilera, they may think of her role in \u201cBurlesque\u201d or her classic hit \u201cGenie in a Bottle,\u201d which is why she was almost unrecognizable on the April issue of Paper Magazine\u2019s \u201cTransformation 2018.\u201d\n\nDespite having a killer voice that has won her five Grammys, Aguilera became typecast in the music and beauty industries because of her over-the-top looks and makeup, which makes this cover so intriguing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been someone that obviously loves to experiment, loves theatrics, loves to create a storyline and play a character in a video or through a stage. I\u2019m a performer, that\u2019s who I am by nature.\u201d She also said that despite her outlook on self-love and acceptance, she\u2019s not giving up on her theatricality, saying, \u201cI\u2019m a girl that likes a beat face, let\u2019s not get it twisted.\u201d\n\nAlong with being most notable for her grandiose looks and sexy pop songs, she has always preached a self-love agenda. In her song \u201cBeautiful,\u201d which was released in 2002, the lyrics tell her story of dealing with insecurities and trying to overcome them and learning to love herself, \u201cno matter what they say.\u201d\n\nIn the Paper Magazine interview, Aguilera talks about still dealing with those who put her down for her looks, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s always gonna be those trolls out there or people that have their own definition and ideal of beauty\u2026 everybody that can\u2019t hop on that train can suck our dicks.\u201d\n\nFor over a decade, Aguilera has been teaching her fans to accept themselves for who they are, and if you\u2019re a person who hates on people for being who they are, then she has no time for you.\n\nIn 2011, Aguilera joined NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d as a coach for its first three seasons. It was being on this show that made her realize that artists in the past few years have had to face a lot less scrutiny than she ever did when she started in the early 2000s, saying how it was a \u201cvery controversial time for me.\u201d\n\nShe raves about how artists today are instead praised for taking risks and being sexually empowered. Although women still face a double standard on sexuality, whether it\u2019s being overtly sexual or not sexual enough, Aguilera sees true progression for women, saying, \u201cMadonna had to go through it in her day, and she paved the way for my generation to come up. And paying it forward, now a younger generation is coming up and I\u2019m loving what I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s so incredible.\u201d\n\nYou might also like: 5 Tracks From \u2018Elevate\u2019 That are Pushing Funk Music to New Heights\n\nOn the cover of Paper Magazine, Aguilera only sports a gold ring that says \u201cMom.\u201d Aguilera opens up in the interview about the domestic abuse her mother went through and how that has also taught her about self-love and raw beauty.\n\n\u201cI watched my mom have to be submissive\u2026 there\u2019s a psychological damage and mental abuse that comes with being in a situation like that. A lot of people don\u2019t have the ability to vocalize it themselves or have the know-how to get out.\u201d Aguilera swore from a young age that she would never get herself in a similar situation, saying how you can either fall down the same path or go down the other path and never allow yourself to rely on another person for happiness.\n\nYou might also like: The iWeigh Movement Floods Instagram as People Embrace Positivity\n\nAguilera also opens up about how she plans to raise her two children. Knowing that social media is becoming more and more influential to children, Aguilera takes the same advice she gives on loving and accepting yourself and applies it to raising her kids in a world where information and ideas are constantly at their fingertips. \u201cThere\u2019s always gonna be the good and the evil, the dark and light\u2026 I really want to make sure my children are both very confident in the sense that they know who they are and that they won\u2019t be easily swayed by outside opinion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that an artist goes barefaced on the cover of a magazine just for fun, so Aguilera fans are questioning whether this is the start of a new era for her, in terms of new music. Her fans wonder whether her new music will have aspects of this new look of hers \u2014 stripped-down and raw.\n\nAlthough Aguilera has neither hinted or commented on the speculations, one can only hope to see the release of a new album with her preaching self-love and showing off her amazing pipes. When asked to give one piece of advice, she said, \u201cBe fearless in breaking new boundaries and don\u2019t be afraid to go against the grain of criticism along the way.\u201d", "images":
