Kelsea\u2019s headlining gig continues through April 27 before she\u2019ll join Keith Urban\u2019s Graffiti U World Tour for 50 dates beginning on June 15.\n\nLikewise, Kelsea\u2019s Australian-born hubby is also keeping a busy tour schedule. In addition to a number of dates in March, Morgan will join Chris Young\u2019s Losing Sleep Tour for 15 stops beginning in April.\n\nWith booming careers and busy tour schedules, Kelsea says the newlyweds have a plan in place to keep their marriage blossoming.\n\n\u201cWe do this thing where we sit down with our calendars once a quarter, and we just figure out when I can go to him, when he can come to me, when we can block two days here and there, and we just figure it out,\u201d says Kelsea to Nash Country Daily. \u201cWe just know that this is the time in our lives where we need to put our heads down and work, and meet up when we can because this is the time when we\u2019re setting that foundation, so hopefully a few years down the road we can say, \u2018We want to take two weeks off here,\u2019 and it\u2019s okay. But right now we can\u2019t, so we get that.\u201d\n\nWhen Kelsea joins Keith\u2019s Graffiti U Tour in June, she\u2019ll most likely get to spend some time with Keith and wife Nicole Kidman, who schedule their careers so that they aren\u2019t away from each other for more than \u201ca handful of days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to learn from [Keith and Nicole],\u201d says Kelsea. \u201cI feel like they balance their lives very well, because they\u2019re at that level, which is why I\u2019m saying we need to keep our heads down for a bit longer.\u201d", "images": ["http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2019/07/12081045/Lauren-Alaina-Chris-Young-150x150.jpg", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2017/09/27142503/Chris-Young1-150x150.jpg", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2019/07/12105957/Clare-Bowen1-150x150.jpg", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2018/02/15130619/Kelsea-Ballerini-Morgan-Evans.jpg", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2017/08/03120011/NASH-Country-Daily-sitelogo-REG.png", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2019/07/12090604/Kane-Brown-TA-150x150.jpg", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2019/05/24074501/Kelsea-Ballerini-Thomas-Rhett-TA-150x150.jpg", "http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/wp-content/themes/headway/library/blocks/social/icons/peel-icons/Youtube.png", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2019/06/13101609/Elaina-Breaking-Thru-150x150.jpg", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2019/07/03100808/Young-Fables-150x150.jpg", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2017/07/20091631/Kelsea-Ballerini-300x225.jpg", "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2018/07/27071823/Kenny-Chesney-AFF-150x150.jpg"], "top_img": "http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/1446/2018/02/15130619/Kelsea-Ballerini-Morgan-Evans.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jim Casey"], "canonical_link": "http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2018/02/15/kelsea-ballerini-hopes-to-learn-from-keith-urban-nicole-kidman-on-balancing-her-career-and-marriage/", "title": "Kelsea Ballerini Hopes to Learn From Keith Urban & Nicole Kidman on Balancing Her Career and Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Nash Country Daily", "title": "Kelsea Ballerini Hopes to Learn From Keith Urban & Nicole Kidman on Balancing Her Career and Marriage", "url": "http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2018/02/15/kelsea-ballerini-hopes-to-learn-from-keith-urban-nicole-kidman-on-balancing-her-career-and-marriage/", "type": "article", "description": "After tying the knot with singer/songwriter Morgan Evans on Dec. 2 and enjoying married life for two months, Kelsea Ballerini got back into \"career mode\" by kicking off her headlining Unapologetically Tour on Feb. 8.
