{"url": "https://www.allure.com/story/aesthetician-skin-care-routine-tips", "text": "Save for dermatologists, there are seldom folks who are as knowledgeable about the inner workings of our epidermis as aestheticians. Like doctors, they've seen it all: acne, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and rosacea. The main difference is you're probably not going to book a facial if you're having an eczema flare-up. While facialists certainly see their fair share of skin concerns, it's their job not to prescribe drugs, but rather to provide treatments that help soothe and transform the skin over time. What's more: Said treatments are usually super tranquil and administered on a sleep-inducing spa table.\n\nAside from the relaxation factor, another tempting reason to see a facialist (interchangably called aesthetician), is the personalized approach. Most of the time these complexion caregivers work by meticulously examining your skin and treating it with whatever it needs, whether it's a heavy dose of hydration, uncomfortable extractions, or a dose of LED light therapy. Celebrities, bloggers, and beauty editors (not to mention everyday folks who crave a clear complexion) rely on aestheticians for balanced, soothed skin that glows \u2014 without the highlighter.\n\nBut, I wonder: How do these skin whisperers care for their own complexions? Because I couldn't shake the curiosity, I decided to ask. Ahead, find the skin-care routines and secrets of six top facialists.\n\nCourtesy of Angela Caglia/Brittany Theophilus\n\nMorning:\n\nThe Hollywood-based facialist and founder of Angela Caglia Skincare prides herself on being a green beauty expert and follows a skin-care meets self-love approach whenever she can.\n\n\"Every day I wake up and go to my fridge to take out my rose quartz roller, which I love to gently roll on my face to stimulate blood flow and assist with lymphatic drainage. It instantly alleviates puffiness and dark circles,\" she says of the first step to her morning routine. \"The energy of the rose quartz is the perfect self-love ritual to start my busy day.\"\n\nNext up, Caglia rinses her face with not warm or tepid, but cold water to further refresh her complexion \u2014 no cleanser needed. \"Usually then I'll just apply Suntegrity Moisturizer or I also love the French pharmacy brand La-Roche Posay's Anthelious AC; they're both light and make my skin happy, while being protected,\" she says. (Spoiler alert: She says she's working on an SPF formulation for her own line as we speak.)\n\nNight:\n\nBelieve it or not, Caglia's p.m. skin-care routine is just as streamlined as her a.m. regimen. She generally sticks to removing any makeup and grime from the day with her Power Cleansing Balm, which she says she uses as a cleanser, mask, and moisturizer as she specifically created it to be a multifunctional product. When her skin requires some extra TLC, she turns to Glam Glow's YouthMud for a deep exfoliation prior to moisturizing. And when she has the time, she loves to give herself high-tech facials and treatments like LED light therapy. \"Usually I'm so busy doing all of my clients, but I try to do it every few weeks,\" she says.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef1d2fa192d41f6b382/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Joanna%252520C.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d2670ba6816ff0008ea9fe6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-951288968.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba53aa00ac6c654eca1f78b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facialists-skin-care-products-social.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d0808622663fe9ce6122f16/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/July%2520ABB%2520Huda_Horizontal.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03c0adf1007c2917fdcdac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-baby-phat-forever-21.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba2cffe2d62302afb583a7a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/shani.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d0aa47b6a1e4e4f878ab52f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/LEDE-beauty1_REv.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03d2e95a946fbd92c4d3a5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/AnDyer_4_HR.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef0d2fa192d41f6b380/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Joanna%252520V.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba5371fb5e7a66397ad1757/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Lede-Facialist.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d07a421ab0933024a53a537/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/selma-blair-haircut.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d1256be9b6d48319cab2acf/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/60-second-rule-face-wash-technique-lede.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef1a91abf2160df1acb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Georgia.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef0a91abf2160df1ac9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Melissa.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef1135b333b10dff073/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Angela.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03ccf0f1007cddbcfdcdb0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/poli.png"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba53aa00ac6c654eca1f78b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facialists-skin-care-products-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Asia Milia Ware", "Leah Prinzivalli", "Kaleigh Fasanella", "Zachary Zane", "Kaleigh Fasanell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/aesthetician-skin-care-routine-tips", "title": "6 Top Aestheticians Reveal Their Skin-Care Routines", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Facialists, aka aestheticians, spend all day caring for their clients' skin, but how do they care for their own complexions? \"Allure\" spoke with six top facialists, including Kim Kardashian West's go-to expert, to find out the products and treatments they use to keep their skin in tip-top shape.", "keywords": "facialists,best facialists,skin care routines,skin-care products,dermarolling,Shani Darden,Joanna Czech,Joanna Vargas,kim kardashian,skin conditions,rosacea,breakouts,acne", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Six skin whisperers, including Kim Kardashian West's go-to guru, told us the products and treatments that keep their complexions in tip-top shape.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba53aa00ac6c654eca1f78b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facialists-skin-care-products-social.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "How Top Aestheticians Take Care of Their Skin", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/aesthetician-skin-care-routine-tips"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Six skin whisperers, including Kim Kardashian West's go-to guru, told us the products and treatments that keep their complexions in tip-top shape.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba53aa00ac6c654eca1f78b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facialists-skin-care-products-social.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "How Top Aestheticians Take Care of Their Skin"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
