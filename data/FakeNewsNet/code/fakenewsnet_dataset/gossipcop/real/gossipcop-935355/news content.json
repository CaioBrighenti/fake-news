There\u2019s more to it than that, but not much more \u2014 the rules are a little unclear, to say the least.\n\nIn attendance at the series\u2019 100th episode party in Los Angeles last week, EW asked the cast of the Liz Meriwether comedy to weigh in on the game and bestow some insight into how to play. No surprise, all of their answers reflected the ambiguity \u2014 and absolute insanity \u2014 of the game.\n\nWANT MORE EW?

It\u2019s just an excuse for a bunch of alcoholics to get together and say \u2018But we\u2019re having fun, we\u2019re playing a game!\u2019 Nah, y\u2019all are alcoholics. You should be ashamed of yourselves.\u201d\n\nHe also advised: \u201cLock the keys away. Don\u2019t be on the road injuring people. I strongly recommend not playing True American because everybody will die,\u201d he added in a dramatic voice.\n\nMax Greenfield, who shines as the neurotic and always hilarious Schmidt, echoed on the point and dangers of the game. \u201cI ultimately think the only goal is to get as drunk as you possibly can, but don\u2019t drive,\u201d he began. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad drinking game. You end up drinking a lot. It actually promotes binge-drinking.\u201d\n\nAs evidenced here:\n\nHannah Simone, meanwhile, wanted some insight herself. \u201cFind out what the rules are and bring them back to us,\u201d said Simone, who plays headstrong bartender Cece, the best friend to Jess (Zooey Deschanel) and fianc\u00e9e to Schmidt. \u201cEverybody goes, \u2018What are the rules for True American?\u2019 and we go, \u2018Well, there aren\u2019t any. That\u2019s what True American is.\u2019 I would love to see what the rules are. Then maybe we can use them on our show, so we have a little more structure.\u201d\n\nAs for the titular new girl, she\u2019s not only calling for the rules, but new rules. \u201cIt\u2019s not a real game,\u201d Deschanel said with a laugh. (But to be fair, are any games really real? They\u2019re all made up.) \u201cI think the way to win the game is by making up new rules because there are no rules.\u201d\n\nTo those who dare take on the game despite the above \u2014 and if you do, remember that you must be of legal drinking age and to play responsibly! \u2014 you\u2019ve been warned of your fate:\n\nFor more on True American, click here to find out what happened when an EW writer tried to play.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gettyimages-459889510.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/andromedastrain_bookshot1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/pose_204_0533r.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/true-american.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/steven-universe2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/katherine-ryan-glitter-room.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3200px%2C1680px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/new-girl-finale-1.jpg?crop=237px%2C253px%2C1144px%2C1144px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/liam-hemsworth.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/true-american.jpg?w=800&h=533&crop=1", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/dressing-funny-1.jpg?crop=396px%2C71px%2C1874px%2C984px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/holland.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/mcdspwo_ec013.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/star.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/hulu.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1156599506.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lost-boys.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/netflix-logo.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/world-of-wonder.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kimmel.jpg?crop=0px%2C32px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1128651285.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/1984_1.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ramsey.jpg?crop=0px%2C62px%2C3000px%2C1576px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33d2a1db94c58fefa700cc9a08ab82da?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/are-you-the-one.jpg?crop=108px%2C0px%2C2892px%2C1518px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-813572278.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/true-american.jpg?w=800&h=533&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["C.
