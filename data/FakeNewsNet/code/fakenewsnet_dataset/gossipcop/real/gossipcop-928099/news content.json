And while the show has always focused, in part, on music \u2014 Archie\u2019s budding music career being just one example \u2014 the show is now taking that to a whole other level. Like many teen dramas before it, Riverdale is planning a musical episode based on the musical adaptation of Carrie. Yes, *that* Carrie, Stephen King\u2019s high school horror classic.\n\nThe Riverdale musical episode will air this season and feature 11 songs sung by the cast.\n\nPer Entertainment Weekly, Riverdale High will stage a musical adaptation of Carrie that stars the incendiary Cheryl Blossom in the title role. The majority of the main cast will be in supporting roles \u2014 Archie as Tommy Ross, Betty as Sue Snell, and Veronica as Chris Hargensen, for starters \u2014 and Kevin Keller will direct. Of course, there will also be a behind-the-scenes documentary on the student musical, and that will be filmed by none other than Jughead Jones.\n\nAll 11 songs featured in the episode will be performed by Riverdale cast members and are originals from the Carrie musical, which was first staged in 1988. It\u2019s set to air on Wednesday, April 18th at 8:00 p.m., and who knows what drama Archie and the gang will get up to by then? We still haven\u2019t even watched the Archie-Mr. Lodge fight scene yet, and a *lot* can happen between now and April. Thankfully, we do have something wonderful to hold us over until this very special episode airs\u2026\n\nCreator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and cast members alike posted an *amazing* announcement \u2014 in the form of a heavily-edited cast list.\n\nWith this, Riverdale has once again shown that it\u2019s *not* like the Archie Comics we grew up on, and we love it all the more for that. You know, as long as they don\u2019t dump buckets of pig\u2019s blood on anyone outside of the musical, of course.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12083149/gina-rodriguez-president-e1562945522927.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12121550/aziz-ansari.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/08/15061655/picture-of-priyanka-chopra-engagement-ring-photo-e1562606368750.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02101219/couple-in-bed-e1562087559934.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12195205/democraticdebate.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12092117/Friends-Pottery-Barn.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/12070257/r-kelly-federal-charges-e1562940201720.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10114259/us-womens-national-team-e1562784596987.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02091156/Louis-Tomlinson.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072542/avatar-g-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/07/17235516/Sansa-e1541615562785.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11093957/camile-mendes-lucy-hale-new-e1562863206330.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/27144916/police-car-e1561672307647.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/03101522/Emma-Portner-Justin-Bieber.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08101357/a-black-lady-sketch-show-e1562606101435.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/10093023/hogwarts-harry-potter-e1562776277452.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11125306/kamala-harris-rape-kits-e1562874800780.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/11071143/us-womens-soccer-espys-e1562854315128.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02092501/ama-abortion-laws-e1562084712895.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28115616/dalai-lama-e1561748186500.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/24065653/riverdale-e1516834642503.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09071547/amy-mcgrath-e1562681757171.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/24065653/riverdale-e1516834642503.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophy Ziss"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/riverdale-musical-episode-carrie/", "title": "\"Riverdale\" is doing a musical episode, and these songs are a far cry from Josie and the Pussycats", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "carrie,musical,Riverdale,television,The CW,TV Shows", "news_keywords": "musical, Carrie", "description": "The CW's \"Riverdale\" will base an entire episode on the musical adaptation of Stephen King's \"Carrie,\" and we need to see this, like, yesterday.", "og": {"title": "\"Riverdale\" is doing a musical episode, and these songs are a far cry from Josie and the Pussycats", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/riverdale-musical-episode-carrie/", "description": "\"Riverdale\" will base an entire episode on one amazing musical.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/24065653/riverdale-e1516834642503.jpg", "width": 840, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/riverdale-musical-episode-carrie/", "description": "The CW's \"Riverdale\" will base an entire episode on the musical adaptation of Stephen King's \"Carrie,\" and we need to see this, like, yesterday.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/24065653/riverdale-e1516834642503.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/riverdale-musical-episode-carrie/", "title": "\"Riverdale\" is doing a musical episode, and these songs are a far cry from Josie and the Pussycats", "description": "\"Riverdale\" will base an entire episode on one amazing musical.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/24065653/riverdale-e1516834642503.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
