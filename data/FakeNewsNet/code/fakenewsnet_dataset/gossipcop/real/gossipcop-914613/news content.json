Like some real Love and Basketball?\"\n\nThat's when Foxx's face turned stone cold. He took off his headphones and mic, and promptly walked off the interview.\n\n\"He ready to go. He ready to hoop,\" Smith said before transitioning to the show's next segment.\n\nGuess Jamie Foxx had to go and couldn't answer a question about playing basketball with Katie Holmes \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/XYq9fPHt3v \u2014 Rob Lopez (@r0bato) February 16, 2018\n\nWhile Foxx wouldn't confirm it, he and Holmes did spend Valentine's Day together playing basketball.
