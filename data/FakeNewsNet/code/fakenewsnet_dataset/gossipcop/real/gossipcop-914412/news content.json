He loves to drape her in Cartier and Lorraine Schwartz jewels and Herm\u00e8s bags. He's also very, very fond of commissioning flower walls. But this year, Yeezus switched it up for Valentine's Day and posted pictures of 52 iconic current and former celebrity couples before posting two shots of \"Kimye\" (as he captioned them) on Instagram. Any images that might have been previously posted were deleted.\n\nHe started by posting a picture of a handwritten card that says, \"Happy Valentine's Day Babe\" and let loose from there. He chose iconic couples like JFK and Jackie O, Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love and the Obamas. And then he decided to take a definitive stance on Sex and the City's whole Mr. Big v.s. Aidan situation. Spoiler: based on his sequence of photos, he is pro-Mr. Big.\n\n\n\nKanye West Returned to Instagram and Posted 55 Photos of Old Celebrity Couples https://t.co/Wi6lkyNh4q \u2014 ELLE Magazine (US) (@ELLEmagazine) February 16, 2018\n\nOf course, all good things must come to an end, and West decided to delete his Instagram following his V-Day takeover. The homage to love was nice while it lasted, though.\n\nHappy belated Valentine's Day, Mr. and Mrs. West!", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/327/663/190703_3983178_Is_Craig_Conover_Really_Over_Naomie_Olindo_.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/briana-ryan-culberson-grocery-shopping.jpg?itok=QiQLmgVL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/1021/703/190709_3985566_Andy_Cohen_Reacts_to_Lisa_Vanderpump_s_Absen.jpg?itok=lNfk2wvQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=8qj_CxiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/05/dish-052317-kim-kanye.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/barbara-luann-rhony.jpg?itok=lOYMeBeH", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/southern-charm-cameran-eubanks.jpg?itok=RYE6blsx", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021418-chris-noth-satc_1.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/rhop-904-candiace-dinner-party-explosion_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/755/619/190627_3980046_Sonja_Morgan_on_Ramona_Singer___She_s_Very_H.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=sLRmUfZw", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021518-kimye.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/below-deck-med-403-joao-cries-over-brooke_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/captain-sandy.jpg?itok=qXjF-_oI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/dorinda-luann-friendship.jpg?itok=_aGuNqe_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/225/655/190710_3986181_What_You_Didn_t_See_Ashley_Jacobs_Do_at_the_.jpg?itok=6y25G9ie", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/dorit-kemsley-morgan-stewart-look-alikes_0.jpg?itok=uElmmY9J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/148/263/190625_3978632_Dorit_Kemsley_on_Camille_Grammer_s_Accusatio.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/cynthia-kenya-kandi.jpg?itok=b8xgPLPA"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021518-kimye.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tamara Palmer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/kanye-west-valentines-day-instagram-post", "title": "Kanye West Revealed His Favorite Carrie Bradshaw Boyfriend ...
