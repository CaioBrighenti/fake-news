(Peter Kramer/Associated Press)\n\nLest there was any shred of remaining doubt about Kim Cattrall\u2019s feelings toward her former \u201cSex and the City\u201d co-star Sarah Jessica Parker, an Instagram post put the matter to rest Saturday.\n\n\u201cYou are not my friend,\u201d Cattrall wrote in a message directed at Parker, less than one week after her 55-year-old brother, Chris Cattrall, was found dead at his home in Canada. An accompanying image with the post read: \u201cI don\u2019t need your love or support at this tragic time @sarahjessicaparker.\u201d\n\nParker had expressed sympathy for Cattrall\u2019s family at a red-carpet event Thursday, telling \u201cExtra\u201d that \u201cwe all send her our love and condolences\u201d while, in the same interview, not ruling out the possibility of a third \u201cSex and the City\u201d movie, but without Cattrall.\n\n\u201cIf somebody in your life, whether you\u2019re in touch with them or not, is suffering for any reason, it\u2019s involuntary that you want to convey condolences or sadness or just let someone know you\u2019re thinking about them,\u201d Parker told \u201cEntertainment Tonight.\u201d\n\nCattrall wasn\u2019t having it, clapping back by suggesting Parker was a \u201chypocrite\u201d and saying even her mother wondered when she would leave Cattrall alone.\n\n\u201cYour continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now,\u201d Cattrall wrote Saturday. \u201cLet me make this VERY clear. (If I haven\u2019t already) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I\u2019m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your \u2018nice girl\u2019 persona.\u201d\n\nTo drive her point home, Cattrall pasted a link to an article by the New York Post\u2019s Paula Froelich from last October, which alleged a \u201cmean-girls culture\u201d that ultimately destroyed the franchise.\n\nPublicists for Cattrall and Parker did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.\n\nOn screen, Cattrall and Parker \u2014 along with Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon \u2014 portrayed best friends navigating their 30s (or, in Cattrall\u2019s case, her early 40s) while pursuing careers, romance and an endless parade of brunches in New York. The \u201cSex and the City\u201d franchise was a hit for HBO, spanning six seasons, inspiring two movies and garnering dozens of award nominations.\n\nOff-screen, however, there were persistent rumors of tension on set. For years, all four stars brushed off any ideas they were feuding, dancing around the issue with oblique quotes about occasional clashes.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on set, you\u2019re working 90-hour weeks, you\u2019re never home, you\u2019re exhausted,\u201d Parker told the Daily Mail in 2010. \u201cThere are times when all of us have been sensitive and sometimes feelings get hurt.\u201d\n\nCattrall, who played publicist Samantha Jones in the series, appeared to agree.\n\n\u201cNineteen-hour workdays are stressful, whether you\u2019re driving a truck, working in a coal mine or on a set and trying to be your brightest at 4 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d Cattrall told the Daily Mail. \u201cBut there\u2019s a camaraderie that happened through all of that. . . . The chemistry among the four of us is very strong.\u201d\n\nBut euphemisms couldn\u2019t hide the undeniable tension between the two after reports surfaced last fall that Cattrall wasn\u2019t interested in participating in a \u201cSex in the City 3\u201d movie. Citing unnamed sources, a Daily Mail \u201cexclusive\u201d blamed the botched sequel plans on Cattrall\u2019s \u201cridiculous demands.\u201d\n\nWoke 2 a @MailOnline \ud83d\udca9storm! The only 'DEMAND' I ever made was that I didn't want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 \u2014 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017\n\nCattrall categorically denied that, tweeting that she had made clear she didn\u2019t want to do a third \u201cSex and the City\u201d movie back in 2016. In a subsequent interview with Piers Morgan, Cattrall also said she and her co-stars had \u201cnever been friends,\u201d despite their on-screen bond.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been colleagues \u2014 and in some ways that\u2019s a very healthy place to be,\u201d Cattrall told Morgan. \u201cThe common ground that we had was the series and the series is over. . . . Sarah Jessica, she could have been nicer, she could have in some way. I don\u2019t know what her issue is. I never have.\u201d\n\nParker recently appeared on \u201cWatch What Happens Live!\u201d to say she was \u201cjust heartbroken\u201d over Cattrall\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cI found it very upsetting because that\u2019s not the way I recall our experience,\u201d Parker told host Andy Cohen. \u201cIt\u2019s sad . . . It was a professional experience, but it became personal, because it was years and years of our lives.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nKim Cattrall pleaded for help finding her missing brother. Hours later, she said he was dead.\n\n\u2018Sex and the City 3\u2019 is no longer happening. Who\u2019s really to blame?\n\nFor years, HBO was a juggernaut. But its future after \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 is a lot less clear.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ENJv3KsACU4xxlmtGtHbGxgtNuA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OJOVP4LGQU7VVN6QYMIRDMW26Y.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/oyZBiQlMAVHTu5NCnzl3lnug9ik=/960x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5IYWEC63AUZTVP545UAWLW2SW4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ENJv3KsACU4xxlmtGtHbGxgtNuA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OJOVP4LGQU7VVN6QYMIRDMW26Y.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy B Wang", "National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns", "February", "Amy B Wang Is A National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns.
