But in many ways this event was no different than others, as buses were provided for guests to be shuttled to the event, and Oprah and Serena rode them just like everyone else!\n\nOprah was one of the first to arrive at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday, May 19, followed by showstoppers like Idris Elba, George and Amal Clooney, Serena Williams and Priyanka Chopra. As the cameras rarely miss anything at events such as this, guests including Oprah and Serena alongside husband Alexis Ohanian, were spotted getting off shuttles that carried them from the security checkpoints to the chapel.\n\n\u00a9 REX/Shutterstock Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian arrive for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018.\n\nWinfrey's best friend and \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King, teased about Oprah's journey into Windsor. \"I said, 'Oprah has to ride the bus? Oprah is not a bus person. Has she been informed?!'\"\n\n600 guests attended the now historic event, although so far it has not been officially documented as to how many actually rode on the shuttles, which were provided by Kensington Palace.\n\nIt seemed to be the last thing on Serena's mind though, as she documented plenty of fun moments on social media with her family, Alexis and their little baby girl, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.\n\nShuttle bus carriage or not, both looked stunning in pink, Williams in a Versace gown while Oprah opted for a Stella McCartney dress after she reportedly dealt with a bit of a wardrobe malfunction prior to the wedding, making it a last-minute switch. She had planned to go in white, but later decided for something more subtle. Hey, it's Oprah, she's got dresses on standby.\n\nShuttle buses, social media and wardrobe changes, in the end the wedding was a smash and the world welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex at a lunch reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II herself at St. George's Hall, where Elton John performed in honor of the newly married Royals.\n\nAll the celebs who attended the royal wedding:", "images": ["https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAEf190.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=805&y=805", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAxw18c.img?h=450&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1584&y=567", "https://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=395&pi=&ps=&su=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fyep-oprah-winfrey-and-serena-williams-rode-the-shuttles-to-the-royal-wedding%252Far-AAxwftV%253Fli%253DAA2qN5v%2526%253Bocid%253Dspartandhp%2526parent-title%253Dfantastic-beasts-sequels-casting-young-dumbledore%2526parent-ns%253Dar%2526parent-content-id%253DAAk3&mkt=en-us&pp=False&cv.partner=Wonderwall&cv.publcat=Whalerock%2BIndustries&st.dpt=entertainment-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636986314966918560&rf=&rid=0ed36d432bd244e6a8b5c5532ca8d663&cvs=Browser&subcvs=entertainment&cv.entityId=AAxwftV&cv.entitySrc=ar&provid=AA5HhRQ&ar=0&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=AA2qN5v&isCorePV=&pgIdx=&pgTot=&activityId=0ed36d432bd244e6a8b5c5532ca8d663&pm=&pg.n=article&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&ex=&aadState=0", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyjFEd.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAEfbhy.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=1412&y=1075", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZjjB.img?h=17&w=0&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&f=png", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZjjB.img?h=100&w=100&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=f&l=f", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyjAuh.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=0ed36d432bd244e6a8b5c5532ca8d663&rnd=636986314966918560&rf=&tp=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fyep-oprah-winfrey-and-serena-williams-rode-the-shuttles-to-the-royal-wedding%252Far-AAxwftV%253Fli%253DAA2qN5v%2526%253Bocid%253Dspartandhp%2526parent-title%253Dfantastic-beasts-sequels-casting-young-dumbledore%2526parent-ns%253Dar%2526parent-content-id%253DAAk3&di=395&lng=en-us&activityId=0ed36d432bd244e6a8b5c5532ca8d663&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&st.dpt=entertainment-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=entertainment&pg.n=article&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&aadState=0", "https://static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/82/c22c7d.gif", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBCFOve.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAxvYiq.img?h=451&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=630&y=322", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&cs_ucfr=1&rn=636986314966918560&c7=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fyep-oprah-winfrey-and-serena-williams-rode-the-shuttles-to-the-royal-wedding%252Far-AAxwftV%253Fli%253DAA2qN5v%2526%253Bocid%253Dspartandhp%2526parent-title%253Dfantastic-beasts-sequels-casting-young-dumbledore%2526parent-ns%253Dar%2526parent-content-id%253DAAk3&c8=&c9=", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAsZMRM.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/57/a49b8d.gif", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZ6og.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAEfiso.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=505&y=145"], "top_img": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAxw18c.img?h=450&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1584&y=567", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wonderwall.com/news/yep-oprah-winfrey-and-serena-williams-road-shuttles-royal-wedding-3014369.article", "title": "Yep, Oprah Winfrey and Serena Williams rode the shuttles to the royal wedding", "meta_data": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Yep, Oprah Winfrey and Serena Williams rode the shuttles to the royal wedding", "cq": "passed", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Yep, Oprah Winfrey and Serena Williams rode the shuttles to the Royal Wedding", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.msn.com", "summary": ""}
