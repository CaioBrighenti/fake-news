Watts wore all black in support of the Time\u2019s Up movement, while Crudup went tie-less in a white shirt and grey suit. The pair's interlocked fingers were hard to miss as they left the bash.\n\nBackgrid\n\nWatts split from her ex-husband, Liev Schreiber, in September 2016. The couple had been together for 11 years and share two children, Samuel and Alexander.\n\nCrudup has a 14-year-old son, William, from a previous relationship with actress Mary Louise Parker, and has also dated Claire Danes.\n\nSee more on the 2018 BAFTAs below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Naomi Watts Talks Incredible Friendship With Nicole Kidman: 'We've Been Through Stuff Together'\n\nNEWS: Naomi Watts Reportedly Dating 'Gypsy' Co-Star Billy Crudup\n\nNEWS: Mary-Louise Parker Finally Opens Up About Billy Crudup Leaving Her for Claire Danes\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/eto_jenelle_evens_071119_vidpic.jpg?itok=sSN5IWjC&h=36445304", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161459903.jpg?itok=8gu6IP-i&h=77af5314", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-12/1280_miley_liam.jpg?itok=gBFfUnWd&h=82971f7c", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-07/set_naomi_watts_billy_crudup_getty_couple.jpg?itok=aflX8kEv", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/set_naomi_watts_billy_crudup_getty_couple.jpg?itok=usU4_Jl9", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640xh/public/images/2018-02/naomi_watts_bgus_1147497_009.jpg?itok=aaOi5-SH"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/set_naomi_watts_billy_crudup_getty_couple.jpg?itok=usU4_Jl9", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leena Tailor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/naomi-watts-holds-hands-with-billy-crudup-at-baftas-after-party-in-london-see-the-pic-96661", "title": "Naomi Watts Holds Hands With Billy Crudup at BAFTAs After-Party in London -- See the Pic!", "meta_data": {"title": "Naomi Watts Holds Hands With Billy Crudup at BAFTAs After-Party in London -- See the Pic! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/naomi-watts-holds-hands-with-billy-crudup-at-baftas-after-party-in-london-see-the-pic-96661", "title": "Naomi Watts Holds Hands With Billy Crudup at BAFTAs After-Party in London -- See the Pic!", "description": "The rumored couple were spotted hand-in-hand in London, England, on Sunday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/set_naomi_watts_billy_crudup_getty_couple.jpg?itok=usU4_Jl9", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The rumored couple were spotted hand-in-hand in London, England, on Sunday.", "title": "Naomi Watts Holds Hands With Billy Crudup at BAFTAs After-Party in London -- See the Pic!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Leena Tailor\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/naomi-watts-holds-hands-with-billy-crudup-at-baftas-after-party-in-london-see-the-pic-96661", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/set_naomi_watts_billy_crudup_getty_couple.jpg?itok=usU4_Jl9"}, "description": "The rumored couple were spotted hand-in-hand in London, England, on Sunday.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Naomi Watts, 2018 BAFTA Awards", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Naomi Watts, 2018 BAFTA Awards"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
