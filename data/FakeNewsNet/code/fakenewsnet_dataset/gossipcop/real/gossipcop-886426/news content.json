Page Six was first to report.\n\nThe fashion designer could walk away with nearly $12 million thanks to the former couple\u2019s prenuptial agreement, a source previously confirmed to PEOPLE.\n\nAccording to the prenup, Chapman was set to receive $300,000 annually in spousal support for their first nine years of marriage. After 10 years, that number jumped to $400,000.\n\nImage zoom BEI/Shutterstock\n\nThough Chapman and Weinstein announced their separation in October, Dec. 15 marked their 10-year wedding anniversary.\n\nThe prenuptial agreement also covered their marital assets, with Chapman receiving $250,000 annually for the first five years, and $700,000 per every additional year. For a housing allowance, she will get $25,000 per month of marriage.\n\nRELATED: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time\u2019s Up Movement\n\nOn Oct. 10, Chapman announced she was leaving Weinstein following allegations of sexual misconduct. In a statement to PEOPLE, she said, \u201cMy heart breaks for all the women who have suffered.\u201d She has since met with divorce lawyers.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be married to Harvey,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE. \u201cShe wants a divorce. It\u2019s just not anything that she is rushing.\u201d\n\nWeinstein and Chapman married in 2007 and have two children together, ages 7 and 4. Weinstein also has three children from a previous marriage.\n\nThe Oscar-winning producer has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 60 women since The New York Times and The New Yorker documented decades of alleged sexual misconduct and sexual assault involving a number of women in detailed articles in October.\n\nA spokesperson for Weinstein previously told PEOPLE in a statement that \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.\u201d", "images":
