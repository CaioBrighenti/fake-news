In best song ever and in drag me down\n\nHe do his job with greater effort than Zayn because for Zayn it is easier\n\nSo in effort Haary is at top\n\nAnd as whole Zayn is at top.\n\nNow talking about liam\n\nHe has a manly voice as said in an answer\n\nBut he loves doing experiment for eg. In kiss you where he too tries high note like Zayn he is at 2 nd according to me(in 4)\n\nNow talking about Louis\n\nLouis has voice one of a kind,he has rather sweet voice which seems to be cracked and has gifted high scale capability.\n\nSo I would rate him 3rd\n\nNow about Niall\n\nNiall has an average voice which most of the population who sing can reach upto but Niall has excellent guitar skills but his singing is not upto the mark so I would mark him 4th\n\nHope my opinion would be helpful", "images": ["https://qsf.fs.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favicon.ico-26-ae77b637b1e7ed2c.ico", "https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-288607756-100-zngbiqogpauehrsskoviepjohmsuxxep.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://qsf.fs.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favicon.ico-26-ae77b637b1e7ed2c.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-best-singer-in-One-Direction", "title": "Who is the best singer in One Direction?", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.quora.com", "summary": ""}
