The media is super shady for posting fake quotes from Caitlyn when she hasn't spoke to anyone,\" she wrote.\n\nAnd speaking of fake stories... The media is super shady for posting fake quotes from Caitlyn when she hasn\u2019t spoke to anyone \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 26, 2017\n\nPeople had reported Friday that Jenner is pregnant and expecting her first child with Travis Scott in February. The magazine later claimed Kardashian had a less-than-enthusiastic response to the news.\n\n\"Her first reaction was, 'Seriously?'\" a source said. \"She didn't respond well at first.\"\n\n\"It's like she and Kanye [West] had gone on this whole journey to get pregnant for months, and now this happens to Kylie,\" the insider added of Kardashian and West reportedly expecting their third child via surrogate. \"She teared up. It definitely took a lot of time for her to process it.\"\n\nIn addition, news broke Tuesday that Kardashian's sister Khloe Kardashian is pregnant and expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson. E! News reported the 33-year-old reality star is \"so happy\" to become a mother.", "images": ["https://www.upi.com/img/expand_gallery.svg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15071286&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8761506517389/2017/1/df605b9f9045444afa26316f10ee9018/v1.5/Kim-Kardashian-breaks-silence-on-Kylie-Jenner-pregnancy-rumors.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6291563017146/2019/upi/c9d0898a0cfd68fbc3a8543b61a93c23/v1.5/Christoph-Waltz-to-play-Blofeld-again-in-Bond-25.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/related/7641562765490/1/v1.2/7af8d3c17a8dfcf2e6370798db8541c5/upi/Royal-Danish-Ballet-rehearses-for-The-Bournonville-Legacy.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7061562941093/2019/upi/1cbd640a40d4930c5f604f7bcb58e1de/v1.5/Miley-Cyrus-on-her-unique-and-modern-marriage-Its-so-complex.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4691562947708/2019/upi/93608c5b7949951fad4700562606e8f1/v1.5/Oprah-Winfrey-opens-private-road-to-help-Maui-fire-evacuations.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/8761506517389/2017/1/df605b9f9045444afa26316f10ee9018/Kim-Kardashian-breaks-silence-on-Kylie-Jenner-pregnancy-rumors.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-hqtKxhsRLFLuJ.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4681562806918/2019/upi/7d34b7058efe6e8ed05d554e532ad4b3/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-July-13-Ken-Jeong-Patrick-Stewart.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5291562946924/2019/upi/56790fd2a653dcd90a5a4859847cbac2/v1.5/Kenny-Chesney-releases-new-song-co-written-with-Ed-Sheeran.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/upi/dw/img/clear.gif"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8761506517389/2017/1/df605b9f9045444afa26316f10ee9018/v1.5/Kim-Kardashian-breaks-silence-on-Kylie-Jenner-pregnancy-rumors.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2017/09/27/Kim-Kardashian-breaks-silence-on-Kylie-Jenner-pregnancy-rumors/8761506517389/", "title": "Kim Kardashian breaks silence on Kylie Jenner pregnancy rumors", "meta_data": {"description": "Kim Kardashian dismissed reports she \"didn't respond well\" to news Kylie Jenner is expecting a baby with Travis Scott.", "keywords": "Entertainment, Khloe Kardashian, Caitlyn Jenner, Tristan Thompson, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Travis Scott", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Khloe Kardashian, Caitlyn Jenner, Tristan Thompson, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Travis Scott", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Kim Kardashian dismissed reports she \"didn't respond well\" to news Kylie Jenner is expecting a baby with Travis Scott.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2017/09/27/Kim-Kardashian-breaks-silence-on-Kylie-Jenner-pregnancy-rumors/8761506517389/", "title": "Kim Kardashian breaks silence on Kylie Jenner pregnancy rumors", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8761506517389/2017/3/38354d11f179087728a460be7d8ce9fc/v1.5/Kim-Kardashian-breaks-silence-on-Kylie-Jenner-pregnancy-rumors.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 399}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "creator": "@littlemannie", "title": "Kim Kardashian breaks silence on Kylie Jenner pregnancy rumors", "description": "Kim Kardashian dismissed reports she \"didn't respond well\" to news Kylie Jenner is expecting a baby with Travis Scott.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8761506517389/2017/upi/df605b9f9045444afa26316f10ee9018/v2.1/Kim-Kardashian-breaks-silence-on-Kylie-Jenner-pregnancy-rumors.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
