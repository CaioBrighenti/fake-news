Bring him in the limo. Game over \u2014 it\u2019d be a really short season.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Michael Strahan John Lamparski/Wireimage\n\nBut dream casting aside, Kufrin, 28, said while she may not have a physical type \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m all over the board\u201d \u2014 she still has an idea of what kind of guy she wants.\n\n\u201cPersonality-wise, I want someone that\u2019s honest and loyal \u2014 obviously,\u201d she said, referencing what just unfolded on The Bachelor with Arie Luyendyk Jr., joking that it felt like \u201ca soap opera.\u201d (The race car driver infamously dumped Kufrin, his finalist and fianc\u00e9e, on national television to pursue his runner-up, Lauren Burnham \u2014 who he\u2019s now engaged to.)\n\nRELATED: Arie Luyendyk Jr. Says Dumping Becca on Camera Gave Her the \u2018Opportunity\u2019 to Land The Bachelorette\n\nGearing up to lead her own season of the ABC reality show, Kufrin told DeGeneres, 61, that she feels \u201cgood\u201d \u2014 and has put the past behind her.\n\n\u201cI went through the entire grieving process: I was mad, I was sad, I was confused,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now, I watched the entire season back and saw his relationships unfolding with everyone else. Seeing that kind of helped move on to realize he just found a better fit with Lauren.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Becca Kufrin Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nKufrin also revealed she hasn\u2019t heard from Luyendyk Jr., 36, since they filmed the live After the Final Rose special on March 6, and doesn\u2019t expect to ever again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said. \u201cJust out of respect for Lauren and that relationship, I don\u2019t think he will [reach out]. Which I understand.\u201d\n\nKufrin\u2019s season of The Bachelorette premieres Monday, May 28 on ABC.", "images":
