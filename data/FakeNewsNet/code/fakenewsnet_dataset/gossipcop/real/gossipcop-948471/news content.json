Later, they stood posted up by the very crowded bar, relaxed, neither of them drinking.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly also caught up with Paris Hilton at the event \u2014 where guests sipped on specialty cocktails provided by Guillotine Vodka \u2014 who gushed over Richie and her relationship with the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star.\n\n\u201cWhatever makes her happy,\u201d Hilton, 37, told Us. \u201cI love Sofia. She\u2019s so sweet and mature. I\u2019m so proud of her. I\u2019ve known her since she was born. She\u2019s a very smart girl.\u201d\n\nAs for whether Hilton thinks Disick is \u201cthe one\u201d for Richie, the Simple Life alum added: \u201cI can\u2019t comment on that, but she\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s successful, she\u2019s killing it and I\u2019m so proud of her. So I always wish her the best.\u201d\n\nRichie and Disick began dating in 2017 following the reality star\u2019s split from ex Kourtney Kardashian, with whom he shares three kids, Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3.\n\nThe Tommy Hilfiger model opened up about what makes their relationship work in an interview last month.\n\n\u201cWe are best friends and that is mainly the strongest connection we have,\u201d told Australia\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cWe have always had that best friend connection and from there it has really worked out. I am so happy.\u201d\n\nReporting by Taylor Ferber\n\nFor all the inside details on the biggest celebrity stories and scoop this week, subscribe to our new podcast \"Us Weekly's Hot Hollywood\" below!\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
