The first official teaser for season three came out on Sunday. In true Issa Dee-fashion, the HBO teaser features our sometimes-fearless Issa freestyling to herself in the mirror, a.k.a. her mirror bitch. As soon as she gets into the groove of the rap, someone knocks on the bathroom door, forcing her back to reality. It\u2019s Daniel. In the season two finale, our girl got \u201chella perspective\u201d in her relationship with Lawrence. We\u2019ll see what season three brings for her and Daniel. Insecure season three premieres on August 12.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/19/GettyImages-960052182.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-crawl.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-hopper-david-harbour-stranger-things-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Dressing-Funny-Rachel-Dratch-Tina-Fey.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-r-kelly.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-stuber.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-arti-gollapudi.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-billie-eilish-song-of-the-week.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/big-brother-sunday.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-julio-torres.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-lil-wayne.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/15/15-r-kelly-criminal-record.w536.h536.jpg ", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/10/16/2-Sarah-Jessica-Parker.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/06/24/24-the-bachelorette.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-review.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/02/02-insecure.w1200.h630.png", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-TomKennyMemes.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-wife.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Oliver-Jackson-Cohen.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Wet-Hot-American-MidSommar.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/02/02-insecure.w1200.h630.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Trupti Rami"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/insecure-season-3-teaser-issa-rae-raps-to-her-mirror-bitch.html", "title": "Insecure Season 3 Teaser: Issa Rae Raps to Her Mirror Bitch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Insecure Season 3 Teaser: Issa Rae Raps to Her \u2018Mirror Bitch\u2019", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/insecure-season-3-teaser-issa-rae-raps-to-her-mirror-bitch.html", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time / Shouldn\u2019t have left you.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/02/02-insecure.w1200.h630.png", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Insecure Season 3 Teaser: Issa Rae Raps to Her Mirror Bitch", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time / Shouldn\u2019t have left you.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/02/02-insecure.w600.h315.2x.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-03T14:28:23.640-04:00", "tag": "insecure, teasers, issa rae, hbo, tv, comedy", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time / Shouldn\u2019t have left you.\u201d", "sailthru.tags": "insecure, teasers, issa rae, hbo, tv, comedy", "author": "Trupti Rami", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528050503.64, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
