ARVAZALLIA HYDRATING ARGAN OIL HAIR MASK\n\nIf we were to describe this mask that we first discovered on Amazon in two words\u2014chill pill (for your hair).

OLAPLEX HAIR PERFECTOR NO 3 REPAIRING TREATMENT\n\nOlaplex, which we\u2019ve raved about before, is a miracle product for even the most abused manes. For unbelievable repair and shine, incorporate it into your weekly hair routine. Keep in mind: This isn\u2019t a leave-in and should be followed by shampoo and conditioner.\n\n5. EVA NYC THERAPY SESSION HAIR MASK\n\nSome masks aren\u2019t meant to be used daily, but you have the option of both\u2013occasional and daily use\u2013with EVA NYC\u2019s Therapy Session. Not only is it sweet-smelling but it\u2019s full of Keravis, a protein that\u2019s clinically proven to strengthen strands.
