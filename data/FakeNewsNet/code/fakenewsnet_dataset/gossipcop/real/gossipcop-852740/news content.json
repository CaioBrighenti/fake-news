Though Bella had hoped to deliver Birdie naturally, after 22 hours of labor, she needed a cesarean section because of her strong abs, her twin sister Nikki Bella revealed to E! News.\n\n\u201cShe tried to go natural, and it was like eight or 10 hours into it, [she] had to get an epidural and then in the end had to get a c-section,\u201d the Total Divas star said during the Fox Upfronts red carpet Monday, where she appeared with her fianc\u00e9, fellow wrestling star John Cena.\n\n\u201cHer abs were too tight!\u201d adds Nikki, 33. \u201cGo figure.
