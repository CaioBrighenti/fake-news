Tre Davis, Nigel Thatch and Melissa Roxburgh. The series came from executive producers Bill Haber, Anna Fricke and Kyle Jarrow, and was a co-production from CBS Television Studios and Warner Bros. Television.\n\n\u201cValor\u201d debuted on the CW\u2019s fall 2018 schedule but failed to receive the back-nine pickup. Its season concluded in late January 2018 with an average of 958,000 total viewers and a rating of 0.21 in the 18-49 demo. \u201cValor\u201d actually beat the CW\u2019s freshman series \u201cDynasty\u201d in the ratings (that latter series is averaging 697,000 total viewers and 0.19 in the demo). However, \u201cDynasty\u201d was among the 10 series the network renewed back in April.\n\nThis comes on the heals of the CW\u2019s midseason freshman drama \u201cLife Sentence\u201d getting canceled.\n\nThe CW has renewed 11 series for the 2018-19 television season.
