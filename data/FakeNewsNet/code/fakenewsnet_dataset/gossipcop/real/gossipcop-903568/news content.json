Paul and his friends filmed their experience in the forest, which included finding a man who had committed suicide, and put it all on tape. Paul was hit hard with an abundance of criticism from fans, celebrities and fellow YouTubers, who deemed the video to be offensive and disrespectful.\n\nPaul initially issued a written apology on his Twitter, followed by a video on his YouTube page with a further statement. \"I should have never posted the video,\" he said, adding \u201cthere are a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn't and for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.\"\n\nPaul -- who has more than 15 million followers on his YouTube channel -- did not specify how long his break will last, but did tell Twitter followers \u201csee you soon.\" See his tweet below.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/logan-paul-sad-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/logan-paul-sad-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Rice"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8092550/logan-paul-suicide-forest-video-controversy-youtube-break-tweet", "title": "Logan Paul 'Taking Time to Reflect' After Suicide Forest Video Controversy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Logan Paul's Suicide Forest Video Controversy: He's 'Taking Time to Reflect'", "description": "The YouTube star tweeted that he would be taking a break from the popular video sharing site after the controversy he faced earlier this week.", "og": {"title": "Logan Paul 'Taking Time to Reflect' After Suicide Forest Video Controversy", "description": "The YouTube star tweeted that he would be taking a break from the popular video sharing site after the controversy he faced earlier this week.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/logan-paul-sad-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8092550/logan-paul-suicide-forest-video-controversy-youtube-break-tweet", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8092550/logan-paul-suicide-forest-video-controversy-youtube-break-tweet", "title": "Logan Paul 'Taking Time to Reflect' After Suicide Forest Video Controversy", "description": "The YouTube star tweeted that he would be taking a break from the popular video sharing site after the controversy he faced earlier this week.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/logan-paul-sad-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
