Men are trash. Don\u2019t ever forget it,\u201d Woodward wrote on one of the surveillance shots, which Woodward later accused Pall of reporting to Instagram after it was deleted by the social network site.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll look you in the eyes and tell you they love you. Then destroy you without a second thought,\u201d she captioned another snap, which appeared to show Pall, 32, kissing the mystery woman.\n\nImage zoom Tori Woodward/Instagram\n\nReps for Pall and The Chainsmokers did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment about the incident, but Woodward \u2014 who has dated Pall since February 2014 \u2014 claimed this wasn\u2019t the first time he had been unfaithful throughout their long relationship.\n\n\u201cAfter hours of begging him for scraps of honesty, I chipped away just enough to confirm that this is not the first time he\u2019s remorsely [sic] cheated on me,\u201d she wrote in another post, listing some of the other women she had questioned him about. \u201cThat \u2018psycho bitch\u2019 from Vegas, the \u2018lame Instagram model\u2019 caught on video and countless others he looked me in the eyes and swore on his life he never touched.\u201d\n\nAccording to Woodward, Pall allegedly gave her excuses for the infidelity but didn\u2019t apologize.\n\n\u201cConsistent outright denial faded to him explaining that because all men do it, it\u2019s not that bad. And in different words, that because he\u2019s famous now, he had a different rulebook for decency,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s perhaps the most amazing is that he HASN\u2019T EVEN APOLOGIZED.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he has done is everything he possibly can to stop this from coming out, from looking [like] the kind of person who does what he\u2019s done,\u201d she claimed. \u201d \u2018You\u2019re better than this.\u2019 That\u2019s right I am, but you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Tori Woodward/Instagram\n\nImage zoom Tori Woodward/Instagram\n\nWoodward turned her heartbreak into empowerment by her message\u2019s end, writing, \u201cif there was ever a time to hold powerful men accountable for their disgusting behavior, it\u2019s now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be that guy. Don\u2019t let your friend or brother or business partner be that guy. Basic respect for women in your life should not be such a hard standard to hold each other to,\u201d she said.\n\nShe concluded her message by thanking her 40K followers for supporting her in her battle.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate all the kind messages I\u2019ve been getting,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m moving on with my life now with the satisfaction that I\u2019m liberated from a horrible person and encourage anyone else in a similar position to know your worth and do the same.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Singer/Songwriter Emily Warren on How the Chainsmokers Handle Criticism:
