The second of two photos shared exclusively by The Hollywood Reporter, below, shows a scene from the dark baptism of Sabrina.\n\nSabrina imagines the origin and adventures of Sabrina the Teenage Witch as a dark coming-of-age story that traffics in horror, the occult and, of course, witchcraft. Tonally in the vein of Rosemary\u2019s Baby and The Exorcist, the adaptation finds Sabrina wrestling to reconcile her dual nature \u2014 half-witch, half-mortal \u2014 while standing against the evil forces that threaten her, her family and the daylight world humans inhabit.\n\nThe series comes from Riverdale mastermind Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who executive produces alongside Riverdale collaborators Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater and Lee Toland Krieger. The drama hails from Warner Bros. Television-based Berlanti Productions.\n\nIn the role of Sabrina, the Mad Men grad will star as an empowered young woman who is just beginning her dark education as a sorceress, even as she tries to maintain a normal life as a sophomore at Baxter High.\n\nThe rest of the cast includes Miranda Otto, Lucy Davis, Ross Lynch, Michelle Gomez, Chance Perdomo, Jaz Sinclair, Richard Coyle, Tati Gabrielle, Adeline Rudolph, Abigail Cowen, Lachlan Watson, Bronson Pinchot and Gavin Leatherwood.\n\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina releases its first 10-episode season Oct. 26 on Netflix. The series, which was first developed at The CW, has already been picked up for a 10-episode second season.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/12/bywcqq0k.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2019/01/dick_wolf_chuck_lorre_kenya_barris_amy_poehler_greg_berlanti__split_0.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/11/this_is_us_ncis_empire_supergirl_modern_family_split.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/08/1638a1f4-388c-43d8-ba50-4cb980129796.png", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2019/05/oitnb_s7_production_still_2-h_2019.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/08/1638a1f4-388c-43d8-ba50-4cb980129796.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Strause", "Jackie.Strause Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflixs-sabrina-series-drops-first-look-at-kiernan-shipka-1134227", "title": "Kiernan Shipka Unveils 'Sabrina' in First Photos of Netflix Series", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "See the first photos of Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina Spellman in Netflix's 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' series about Sabrina the Teenage Witch.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflixs-sabrina-series-drops-first-look-at-kiernan-shipka-1134227", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Kiernan Shipka Unveils 'Sabrina' in First Photos of Netflix Series", "description": "Shipka stars as Sabrina Spellman in Netflix's dark, coming-of-age 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' series.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/08/1638a1f4-388c-43d8-ba50-4cb980129796.png"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Kiernan Shipka Unveils 'Sabrina' in First Photos of Netflix Series", "description": "Shipka stars as Sabrina Spellman in Netflix's dark, coming-of-age 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' series.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflixs-sabrina-series-drops-first-look-at-kiernan-shipka-1134227", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/08/1638a1f4-388c-43d8-ba50-4cb980129796.png", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "type": "image/png"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Kiernan Shipka Unveils 'Sabrina' in First Photos of Netflix Series", "sailthru.description": "Shipka stars as Sabrina Spellman in Netflix's dark, coming-of-age 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' series.", "sailthru.author": "Jackie Strause", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.date": "2018-08-13 07:00:26", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534158026.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
