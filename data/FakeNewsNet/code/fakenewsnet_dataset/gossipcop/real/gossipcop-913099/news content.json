So the Chicago Bulls took a different route when sending their new baby wishes.\n\nThe 37-year-old mom took to Instagram on Saturday, February 10, to thank the NBA team for sending her newborn a sweatshirt, bib and jersey with the word \u201cChicago\u201d and No. 1 on the front.\n\nThough the Kardashians are Los Angeles Lakers fans, West, 40, grew up in Chicago and named his third child after his native city.\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and her Grammy winner husband have been inundated with presents in the last four weeks. Kardashian\u2019s BFF Jonathan Cheban sent over 20 boxes of deep dish pizza from Chicago-based restaurant chain Giordano\u2019s!\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very cute,\u201d Cheban, 43, told Us Weekly exclusively of the newborn on February 7. Cheban, who makes regular appearances on KUWTK, explained he chose pizza because \u201ceveryone always sends flowers and it\u2019s no fun.\u201d\n\nCheban confessed he hasn\u2019t had a chance to buy a present for Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott\u2019s little girl, Stormi \u2014 but it\u2019s not for lack of caring. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a second!\u201d he told Us. The 20-year-old, who chose to keep her pregnancy private, gave birth to her first child on February 1.\n\nWith all the new additions to the Kardashian-Jenner family, Cheban says he\u2019s yearning for his own bundle of joy. \u201cI need to find someone to have kids of my own,\u201d he revealed. \u201cI want to have a kid in two years. I have a deadline.\u201d\n\nChicago was born via surrogate on January 15, joining big sister North, and brother Saint, 2.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
