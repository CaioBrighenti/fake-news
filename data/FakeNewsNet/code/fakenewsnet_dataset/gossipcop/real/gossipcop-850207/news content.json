university choosing to pursue a career as a racing driver competing up to Formula 3 level.\n\nHe won the British Formula Renault Championship in 1994 for Manor Motorsport, and later that year picked up the Eurocup Formula Renault title.\n\nHe started his career in finance in 1995 as a derivatives trader at Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, which is now part of Goldman Sachs, before co-founding Eden Rock Capital Management in 2001.\n\nHis childhood was spent jetting between Lincolnshire and the Caribbean island of St Barths where his parents moved to after buying the luxury Eden Rock hotel.",
