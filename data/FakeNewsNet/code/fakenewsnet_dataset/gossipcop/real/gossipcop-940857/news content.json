Eva Longoria welcomed her first child \u2014 a boy named Santiago Enrique \u2014 with husband Jos\u00e9 Bast\u00f3n in Los Angeles on Tuesday, June 19, her rep confirms to Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful for this beautiful blessing,\u201d the couple said in a statement to Hola! USA, in addition to sharing the first photo of their newborn with Us and the magazine.\n\nUs confirmed in December that the Desperate Housewives alum was expecting. While this is her first child, it\u2019s Bast\u00f3n\u2019s fourth. He shares three kids \u2014 son Jos\u00e9 and daughters Tali and Mariana \u2014 with ex-wife Natalia Esper\u00f3n.\n\nThe Telenovela actress chatted with Us Weekly in February where she dished on finding out she was pregnant while directing Fox\u2019s comedy The Mick. \u201cI thought they\u2019re going to think I\u2019m a terrible director because I\u2019m just sleeping all the time!\u201d she told Us at the time. \u201cEvery chance I got I took a nap!\u201d\n\nThe busy mom also revealed at the time that she and Bast\u00f3n had not yet chosen a name. \u201cOnce I finish this pilot, I\u2019ll be able to focus on getting ready for my little boy,\u201d she told Us.\n\nThroughout her pregnancy the 43-year-old embraced her baby bump, often times documenting her journey to motherhood on social media. In March \u2014 just three months before giving birth \u2014 the glowing actress took to Instagram Live to joke about her clothes no longer fitting.\n\n\u201cCan I just show you guys that my sweaters don\u2019t fit me anymore on my belly,\u201d Longoria said in the video. \u201cI try to keep pulling them down and they just go back up.\u201d\n\nLongoria and Bast\u00f3n wed in May 2016 in Acapulco, Mexico.\n\nFor the latest celebrity news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cIn Case You Missed Us\u201d below!\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jose-baston-eva-longoria.jpg?crop=227px%2C51px%2C1441px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jose-baston-eva-longoria.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Eva-Longoria-baby-Hola.jpg?w=241"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jose-baston-eva-longoria.jpg?crop=227px%2C51px%2C1441px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/eva-longoria-gives-birth-to-first-child-with-jose-baston/", "title": "Eva Longoria Gives Birth to First Child With Jose Baston", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Eva Longoria and husband Jose Baston have welcomed their first child, a boy named Santiago Enrique \u2014 see the first photo!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Eva Longoria Welcomes First Child With Jose Baston: See the First Pic!", "description": "Eva Longoria and husband Jose Baston have welcomed their first child, a boy named Santiago Enrique \u2014 see the first photo!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/eva-longoria-gives-birth-to-first-child-with-jose-baston/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:11:18+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jose-baston-eva-longoria.jpg?crop=227px%2C51px%2C1441px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jose-baston-eva-longoria.jpg?crop=227px%2C51px%2C1441px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Jose Antonio Baston Eva Longoria baby"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-06-20T10:36:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:11:18+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Eva Longoria and husband Jose Baston have welcomed their first child, a boy named Santiago Enrique \u2014 see the first photo!", "title": "Eva Longoria Welcomes First Child With Jose Baston: See the First Pic!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jose-baston-eva-longoria.jpg?crop=227px%2C51px%2C1441px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cropped-Us-512x512.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529490975.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
