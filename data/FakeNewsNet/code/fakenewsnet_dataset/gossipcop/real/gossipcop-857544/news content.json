{"url": "https://www.allure.com/story/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-kids-2018", "text": "UPDATE (February 27, 2019): It's been a little over a year since we last got a glimpse of Angelina Jolie and her six children together, but this past Monday, the actress attended a screening of Netflix's The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind in New York with the whole crew in tow. (No sign of Brad Pitt, though.) And my-oh-my, do they look grown. Anyone who's followed the star's career can likely remember when Maddox, who is now 17 (!) was just a tiny tike who Jolie would tote around in her arms and shield from paparazzi photos. Time flies, folks.\n\nThe other five children, Pax, 15; Zahara, 14; Shiloh, 12; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 10, all look markedly older as well, though it is worth noting they all were decked out in A-list event attire. For instance, Zahara wore a sleek black dress, while the others wore different suit variations with their own personal touches. Ensembles aside, though, it's obvious through their facial features and general demeanors alone that they're all growing up and coming into their own. While Pax and Maddox both put on serious faces, the younger ones showed off their beautiful smiles.\n\nNeedless to say, this was a rare treat \u2014 we hope to see more of the Jolie fam all together in the future.\n\nThis post was originally published on February 4, 2018.\n\nIt's true that they're two of the world's most famous celebrities, but Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have done a pretty good job at raising their six children mostly out of the Hollywood limelight. Even through their recent (and highly publicized) breakup, the two have been very open about their commitment to their children and their desire to co-parent healthy, active children. As such, Jolie was recently spotted in Paris during an outing with all six of them during a break from her Guerlain campaign. The family was enjoying some quality time together while perusing the art at the Louvre.\n\nJolie with Shiloh, Maddox, Vivienne Marcheline, Pax Thien, Zahara Marley, Knox Leon in Paris in 2018 Getty Images\n\nThough they're not seen all together frequently, it's not the first time the family has been spotted all in the same place by photographers. Back in 2013, most of the Jolie-Pitt children were snapped while at the Sydney Aquarium in Australia (you'll notice Maddox is the only one missing from the photo below \u2014 likely, he hung back to spend some quality time with his dad). Most photos available are of one or two of the kids out on an errand with either Jolie or Pitt, and that's really OK; while it's understandable that fans want to see more, the family deserves their privacy.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5d28cdb06c8f950008134e40/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Angelia%2520Jolie.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d0e43f9e0795c7e5e236a9d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kylie-jenner-for-kylie-cosmetics-valentines-2019-collection.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03c0adf1007c2917fdcdac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-baby-phat-forever-21.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5c76f3664ab6525533e561da/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-kids-lede.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a7735451da1514c1095a3f2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-912347326.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a773565f4921368f46d0a59/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-180157323.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d02c492ec86feefff08f42f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/serena.-olympia.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d0d014af598f629b5cce25e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/pregnant%2520belly.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d07a421ab0933024a53a537/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/selma-blair-haircut.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5c77015add6ee2146e3dcf21/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Angelina%2520Jolie%2520kids%2520today%2520-%2520Maddox%2520Pax%2520Zahara%2520Shiloh%2520Knox%2520Vivienne%25202019%2520-%2520SOCIAL.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03ccf0f1007cddbcfdcdb0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/poli.png"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5c77015add6ee2146e3dcf21/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Angelina%2520Jolie%2520kids%2520today%2520-%2520Maddox%2520Pax%2520Zahara%2520Shiloh%2520Knox%2520Vivienne%25202019%2520-%2520SOCIAL.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Leah Prinzivalli", "Asia Milia Ware", "Kaleigh Fasanella", "Zachary Zane", "Rosemary Donahu", "Kaleigh Fasanell", "Marci Robin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-kids-2018", "title": "What Angelina Jolie's Kids Look Like Today \u2013 2019 Photos", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Angelina Jolie was spotted with her children \u2014 the eldest of whom, Maddox, is now 17 years old \u2014 at a screening for Netflix's \"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind.\" No sign of dad Brad Pitt at the event, but the biggest thing we noticed: The kids are looking seriously grown-up, and it's making us feel super nostalgic (and a little old, too).", "keywords": "angelina jolie,celebrities,kids,transformations,celebrity kids", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "I feel old.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5c77015add6ee2146e3dcf21/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Angelina%2520Jolie%2520kids%2520today%2520-%2520Maddox%2520Pax%2520Zahara%2520Shiloh%2520Knox%2520Vivienne%25202019%2520-%2520SOCIAL.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Here's What Angelina Jolie's Six Kids Look Like Today", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-kids-2018"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "I feel old.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5c77015add6ee2146e3dcf21/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Angelina%2520Jolie%2520kids%2520today%2520-%2520Maddox%2520Pax%2520Zahara%2520Shiloh%2520Knox%2520Vivienne%25202019%2520-%2520SOCIAL.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Here's What Angelina Jolie's Six Kids Look Like Today"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
