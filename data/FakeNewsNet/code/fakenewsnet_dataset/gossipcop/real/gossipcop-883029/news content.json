Comedians Heidi Gardner, Chris Redd and Luke Null will join the sketch comedy when it returns to NBC this weekend. The trio replaces departed cast members Bobby Moynihan, Vanessa Bayer and Sasheer Zamata. The news comes as Lorne Michaels' veteran variety show revamps and diversifies its roster of talent. \"SNL\" also has hired seven new writers: Nimesh Patel \u2014 who's being touted as the answer to its dearth of South Asian talent \u2014 Sam Jay, Gary Richardson, Erik Marino, Andrew Dismukes, Steven Castillo and Claire Friedman.\n\nHere's a rundown of the on-camera rookies and where you might have seen (or heard) them before: Heidi Gardner L.A.
