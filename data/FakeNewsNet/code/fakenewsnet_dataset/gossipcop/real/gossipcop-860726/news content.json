It took everything you knew, crumpled it up into a little ball, and kicked it right at the sun. It was, in a word, bad. In the best possible way.\n\nThe season 1 finale of NBC afterlife comedy The Good Place ended with the mother(forker) of all twists: Eleanor (Kristen Bell) figured out that the reason that she and her cohorts \u2014 Chidi (William Jackson Harper), Jason (Manny Jacinto), and Tahani (Jameela Jamil) \u2014 had been so miserable in the Good Place was because\u2026 they were actually in the Bad Place, thanks to a plan masterminded by not-so-angelic-after-all architect Michael (Ted Danson).\n\nGood Place creator Michael Schur wanted to keep the tightest of lids on this secret on which the entire season was built, so he clued in only Danson and Bell, leaving the rest of the cast as oblivious as their characters. \u201cTheir performances were going to be exactly what they should be without knowing it, so it didn\u2019t seem like there was any actual benefit to telling them outside of, like, friendship,\u201d says Schur. \u201cI sort of rolled the dice on the idea that they wouldn\u2019t hate me if I didn\u2019t tell them until later\u2026 In a show about ethics and morality, I did stop and check in with myself every once in a while, like, \u2018What is the ethics of this?\u2019 and I decided it wasn\u2019t really an ethical issue. It was a creative issue and that made me feel better about the decision.\u201d\n\nWhen he finally did gather the full cast \u2014 which also includes pleasant know-it-all human Alexa named Janet (D\u2019Arcy Carden) \u2014 to clue them in before filming the finale, Bell decided to record the moment for posterity. And, well, maybe for other reasons. \u201cI thought it was going to be my first submission to America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos, the best television show ever to grace the planet,\u201d she says. \u201cI really thought it was going to win me a hundred thousand dollars, their big jackpot prize. It was as good as you think it is because they were really stunned. They were having trouble\u2026 It was very paralyzing \u2014 they were all like \u2018Huh?\u2019 because it was an alternate reality to what they had been living in. They had been living in something that was completely untrue, just like their characters.\u201d As she sums up: \u201cI wanted to see everyone\u2019s unique ability to digest this betrayal.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Entertainment Weekly, Allen Berezovsky/WireImage\n\nAdds Danson: \u201cIt was just so satisfying \u2014 you could see them process everything and go, \u2018Wait, is that possible?\u2019 and see them play back in their heads everything we had shot and go, \u2018Oh my goodness. It is possible.\u2019 I think it really disturbed them for a minute. It wasn\u2019t howling with laughter, I think they felt somewhat similar to the characters, slightly betrayed. [Laughs] They would look at me slightly differently from then on.\u201d\n\nIn truth, the cast was forgiving after the deception. \u201cIt was good not to know until the very end,\u201d Harper told EW earlier this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of the character to not know. In a way, it\u2019s like Ted, Kristen, and Mike made me a Method actor against my will, which is great! Who knows what I would have done?\u201d\n\nBell has been holding onto the video of the reveal for nearly a year, but has graciously agreed to debut it right here on EW.com before you dive into season 2, which kicks off Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET with an hourlong premiere. So, here is Schur unveiling the events leading up to the stunning twist to a rather rapt Jamil, Carden, Jacinto, and Harper. When the creator drops the bomb (\u201cThey\u2019re never going to call a train to send us to the Bad Place. They can\u2019t. Because we\u2019re already here. This is the Bad Place\u201d), the real fun begins, as Jamil and Carden go full-on hands-on-face shock, with Carden muttering, \u201cWhat???\u201d while Harper lets loose with an \u201cOhhh!!!\u201d and Jacinto, well, he really seems to have his mind melted.
