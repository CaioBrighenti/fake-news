He proposed to her on a season 8 episode \u2014 news of which PEOPLE first reported in May 2017 \u2014 surprising Staub on the grounds of a beautiful mansion, where a violinist played Pachelbel\u2019s \u201cCanon in D\u201d and a handful of couples danced around them.\n\nA year after Caffrey popped the question, the duo got married in May in a sunset bohemian beach ceremony held on the Bahamas\u2019 North Bimini Island at the Luna Beach Club.\n\nWATCH: \u2018RHONJ\u2019 Star Danielle Staub on Fighting in Front of The Camera\u2019s: \u2018I Play The Broken Record\u2019\n\nBut two months into their marriage, the couple was facing marital problems.\n\nFollowing reports that the pair had split, a rep for the 55-year-old Real Housewives of New Jersey star told PEOPLE that while they were \u201chaving some difficulties,\u201d Staub was hoping for a happy resolution.\n\n\u201cDanielle is having some difficulties with her marriage right now and is hoping everything will work out,\u201d Staub\u2019s rep said.\n\nEarlier this month, Caffrey obtained a temporary restraining order against Staub, just one day after Staub was granted a temporary restraining order against him following a domestic dispute at their New Jersey home over the weekend.\n\nIn the court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Caffrey claimed Staub has been \u201cangry since Thursday after receiving a letter from his attorney indicating he was filing for a divorce.\u201d\n\nBoth Caffrey and Staub dropped their restraining orders.\n\nRELATED: Danielle Staub Stages Intimate Lingerie Shoot for Fianc\u00e9 Ahead of Wedding: See the Sexy Pics!\n\nPrior to the incident, the source said Caffrey and Staub were not communicating directly.\n\n\u201cDanielle\u2019s been refusing to speak to him. If he wants to tell her something he has to call her publicist and the publicist would talk to her,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey stay on separate sides of the house. It\u2019s been Danielle and her daughter Jillian in one area and Marty in another. Anytime he tries to reach out to her or even walks down to the kitchen to talk to her, Danielle tells him to call her publicist.\u201d\n\nBut Staub\u2019s rep fired back in a statement to PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cThe claims being made are beyond preposterous and clearly a knee-jerk reaction to Danielle\u2019s filing,\u201d her rep said. \u201cI cannot imagine there is a single person gullible enough to believe any of this nonsense. If even ten percent of these claims were true, any normal person would have already filed for divorce or, better yet, not married the person in the first place. This is laughable.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/john-schneider-5.jpg",
