As a matter of fact. I hadn\u2019t actually seen him in, like, four years. It was kind of an awesome rumor. I kind of liked it. I was like, \u2018OK, fine. We\u2019re having twins!'\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Sealed With a Kiss!

He\u2019s already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won\u2019t speak to me.\u201d\n\nOliver went on to write even their mom Goldie Hawn, was \u201covertly flirting with him,\u201d going around \u201cwearing these little nighties around the house.\u201d\n\nHudson was one of the actresses Pitt was linked to after splitting from Angelina Jolie in September 2016.
