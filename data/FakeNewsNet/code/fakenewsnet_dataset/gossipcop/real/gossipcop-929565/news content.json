Both Camp Rock films and all three Cheetah Girls movies are leaving alongside one-off classics like Cadet Kelly, Cow Belles, Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior, and more.\n\nThe DCOM exodus takes up most of this month\u2019s list, but rom-coms Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary and To Rome With Love are also on last call, as well as Ocean\u2019s Eleven, GoodFellas, and The Hurt Locker.\n\nCheck out the list below for all the titles leaving Netflix in May.\n\nLeaving May 1\n\nBridget Jones\u2019s Diary\n\nCasper\n\nChappie\n\nCharlotte\u2019s Web\n\nField of Dreams\n\nGoodFellas\n\nOcean\u2019s Eleven\n\nSahara\n\nSilent Hill\n\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose\n\nThe Hurt Locker\n\nTo Rome With Love\n\nTo Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything!
