My Next Guest Needs No Introduction will be a six-episode limited series which, unlike most shows within the Netflix purview, will be released one at a time, monthly, rather than all at once. Here's a teaser.\n\nLetterman's been off TV since his widely-publicized retirement in May 2015, which was overshadowed by his even-more-publicized retirement beard. Yeah, it's only been two and a half years. But that's a long time in TV.\n\nA good crop of guests make up the first season: George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, Jay-Z, Tina Fey, Howard Stern, and freakin' Barack Obama. The first episode is set to hit Netflix on January 12.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/5d03b3105a0422052cd9370f/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/Fashion-RoundUp-GQ-06142019_16x9.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/58c9b73d11a294712ad6ecf7/1:1/w_80%2Cc_limit/68_Tom_Phillip-resize.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/logo-header.d739eb0c2af2cf500d0c7ebecd1d6597474e69aa.svg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/logo-reverse.2fe772617ee3b7f2fc81c9f7237c17495b42eaee.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5cffd3a927710c46b54e5749/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/RLD-Mick-Rouse_11278.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5d03f2fa5a0422f37dd9374c/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/meal-kit-best-stuff-3x2.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5cfec4fd5a04225046d935dc/4:3/w_800%2Ch_600%2Cc_limit/Best-Sex-Podcasts-GQ-2019-061019.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Rachel Tashjian", "Alex Shultz", "Sophia Benoit", "Andrew Goble", "Tom Phili"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/david-lettermans-new-netflix-show-has-some-stellar-guests-lined-up", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "The Late Show standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "'The Late Show' standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/david-lettermans-new-netflix-show-has-some-stellar-guests-lined-up"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'The Late Show' standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097, "admins": 108943}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctBVhyZxXYY"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
