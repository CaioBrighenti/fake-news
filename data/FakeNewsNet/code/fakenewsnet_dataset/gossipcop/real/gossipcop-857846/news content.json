And while Peter made a superb first impression, it seems Copper is now the early front-runner for the final rose.\n\nMy final rose pick. https://t.co/Z2huaRW00S \u2014 April Lavalle (@imatoofbrush) May 30, 2017\n\nHopefully this a sign that a dog-based Bachelor show is on the horizon; one where all the contestants have dogs and can only date the Bachelor/Bachelorette if their dogs get along.\n\nUntil this dream comes true, we are focused on finding out as much as we can about Rachel\u2019s dreamy dog. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve dug up on Copper so far.\n\nHe is Rachel\u2019s best friend, obviously.\n\n\"My best friend can be a tough critic!\" \u2013 Rachel\n\n\u263a\ufe0f#TheBachelorette
