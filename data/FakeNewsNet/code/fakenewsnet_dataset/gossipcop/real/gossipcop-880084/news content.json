Gomez's friend Francia Raisa was the kidney donor, and her message about helping the singer \u2014 and others \u2014 is an emotional one.\n\n\"I am beyond grateful that God would trust me with something that not only saved a life, but changed mine in the process,\" the \"Secret Life of the American Teenager\" actress wrote in her own Instagram post. She shared the same photo that Gomez used to make her announcement \u2014 a pic of the two girls in side-by-side hospital beds, hooked up to machines as they hold hands and smile at each other.\n\n\"This was part of our story, and we will share it soon,\" she wrote. \"But what is important now is that this is not the only story.\"\n\nRaisa then linked to the Lupus Research Alliance website, urging her followers to learn more about the autoimmune disease. Gomez shared the same link in her original post, noting that \"Lupus continues to be very misunderstood but progress is being made.\"\n\nGomez and Raisa have been friends since 2007, forming a bond at, of all places, a hospital. \"Six years ago Disney and ABC Family had the stars of their shows go to the Children's Hospital,\" Raisa told Latina in 2013. \"Selena and I were in the same group and we just clicked.\"\n\nRaisa ended her Instagram post about being a donor with a simple message for Gomez: \"Love you sis, so glad we're on this journey together.\"", "images": ["https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59010f75dd08959c288b45f9-750.jpg", "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59bc1c77ba785e76fe5e7d58-750.jpg", "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59bc1c77ba785e76fe5e7d59-750.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59bc1c77ba785e76fe5e7d58-750.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Villeneuve", "Brit"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brit.co/francia-raisa-instagram-note-donating-kidney-selena-gomez/", "title": "Selena Gomez's best friend Francia Raisa speaks out about donating her kidney to the star", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-09-15", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-15", "news_keywords": "Contributor, Brit and co, Culture, Selena Gomez, Francia Raisa, Culture Contributor", "sailthru.tags": "Contributor, Brit and co, Culture, Selena Gomez, Francia Raisa, Culture Contributor", "description": "Francia Raisa took to Instagram to express her support for the singer, saying \"Love you sis, so glad we\u2019re on this journey together.\"", "sailthru.description": "Francia Raisa took to Instagram to express her support for the singer, saying \"Love you sis, so glad we\u2019re on this journey together.\"", "title": "Selena Gomez's best friend Francia Raisa speaks out about donating her kidney to the star", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire-contributor, thewire", "sailthru.title": "Selena Gomez's best friend Francia Raisa speaks out about donating her kidney to the star", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59bc1c77ba785e76fe5e7d58-750.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59bc1c77ba785e76fe5e7d57-750.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59bc1c77ba785e76fe5e7d57-750.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment Contributors", "og": {"title": "Selena Gomez's best friend Francia Raisa speaks out about donating her kidney to the star", "description": "Francia Raisa took to Instagram to express her support for the singer, saying \"Love you sis, so glad we\u2019re on this journey together.\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/selena-gomezs-kidney-donor-francia-raisa-posts-on-instagram-2017-9", "image": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59bc1c77ba785e76fe5e7d58-750.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Brit + Co", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/selena-gomezs-kidney-donor-francia-raisa-posts-on-instagram-2017-9", "title": "Selena Gomez's best friend Francia Raisa speaks out about donating her kidney to the star", "description": "Francia Raisa took to Instagram to express her support for the singer, saying \"Love you sis, so glad we\u2019re on this journey together.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/59bc1c77ba785e76fe5e7d58-750.jpg", "site": "@bi_contributors"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "Selena Gomez's best friend Francia Raisa speaks out about donating her kidney to the star": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505448000.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
