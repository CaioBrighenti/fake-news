In a 1934 photo, Helmer and Naemi Larsson, a Swedish couple, appear to be using an actual stick to press the button on a camera above them.\n\nImage Is this 2006 picture the first selfie ever? No, it\u2019s not. Credit Paris Hilton, via Twitter\n\nNot great news for the heiress. But maybe she\u2019d argue that real selfies have to include celebrities. If so, Cindy Sherman, Andy Warhol, Madonna and others got there first.\n\nWell, could a selfie have existed before the term existed? \u201cSelfie\u201d came into popular usage only in 2002, about four years before Ms. Hilton and Ms. Spears posed for the pictures. Mr. Marino and I were getting closer!\n\nStill, try as we might, we could not come up with a way to prove Ms. Hilton right.\n\n\u201cCould it be that they felt that there had never been a selfie quite like this before?\u201d Mr. Marino mused. \u201cShe\u2019s not being ahistorical \u2014 she\u2019s saying \u2018we\u2019 did something with selfies that had not to that moment been done?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut yeah, it\u2019s hard for me to tell what that is,\u201d he said.\n\nIn conclusion, Paris Hilton did not invent the selfie. Her publicist did not answer questions about whether her tweet was serious. Ms. Spears\u2019s publicist did not respond, either.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/us/21xp-selfie/21xp-selfie-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/us/21xp-selfie/21xp-selfie-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/us/21xp-selfie/21xp-selfie-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonah Engel Bromwich"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/style/paris-hilton-selfie.html", "title": "Paris Hilton Said She Invented the Selfie.
