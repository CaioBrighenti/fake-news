There, Stamos staged an elaborate engagement event for his then-girlfriend, including a short compilation of their favorite Disney films. It all ended with \"The Little Mermaid\" and the caption \u201cjust ask the girl.\u201d Of course, Stamos did. On Instagram McHugh posted, \u201cI kissed the boy and said . . . yes!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loves Disneyland and [at the park], I got on my knee and asked her,\u201d Stamos told PEOPLE of their engagement. \u201cI pulled the ring out. I don\u2019t know how she did it, but she went to hug me and slipped her finger right in it. When the park closed, we ran around the park in our Disney onesies.\u201d\n\nSince that day the two went on to get hitched in a gorgeous ceremony at the Little Brown Church in Studio City, California, then partied the night away at their home.\n\nNow, just a week into their marriage, they are celebrating again at the Happiest Place on Earth.\n\nAs McHugh\u2019s Instagram shows, the pair has been spending plenty of time at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. While there they\u2019ve even been spotted wearing matching mouse ears, though hers were a bit more spectacular as they came with a bridal veil.\n\nMcHugh shared even more of their journey through the park, where they stopped in at shops to look at tiny baby trinkets since they are expecting their first child this spring.\n\nOn his page Stamos shared his own adorable image of the pair as they smooched near the castle joking of their one-week anniversary, \u201cand they said it wouldn\u2019t last.\u201d\n\nWhile this may be their last trip to the park before the baby\u2019s arrival, odds are their upcoming bundle of joy will be a Disney baby, whether he or she likes it or not.", "images":
