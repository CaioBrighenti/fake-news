Then, the couple is shown in what looks like an intimate vow renewal ceremony. Clad in a white suit, Jay-Z embraces Blue before joining Beyonc\u00e9, who is wearing a veil and a dress not unlike the one she wore at their original wedding ceremony, her hair pulled back in a chignon. Closer scrutiny shows Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mother Tina Knowles and a blonde Solange standing behind them. Two babies appear in the foreground, though it\u2019s hard to say whether they\u2019re Rumi and Sir, since previous reports of a \u201csecond look\u201d at the twins proved to be false.\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nThis is just the kickoff of \u201cOTR II,\u201d which will continue through October with the North American tour beginning in Cleveland on July 25. Bey and Jay together on stage again feels like an ideal celebration of their 10th anniversary this year. Their children have reportedly joined them on tour, so more family moments, both onstage and off, seem inevitable.\n\nAfter the apparent vow renewal played, the words THIS IS REAL LOVE flashed onscreen. As the couple led the crowd in a singalong, it was easy to believe.", "images": ["https://collector-PX0lizzs6W.perimeterx.net/api/v1/collector/noScript.gif?appId=PX0lizzs6W", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b1952ec7357fe57e6f16580/16:9/pass/00-social-image-beyonce-jay-z-renewed-wedding-vows.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b1952ec7357fe57e6f16580/16:9/pass/00-social-image-beyonce-jay-z-renewed-wedding-vows.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ella Riley-Adams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-and-jay-z-on-the-run-ii-tour-wedding-vow-renewal", "title": "Did Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z Renew Their Vows?
