On Thursday, the star of Southern Charm revealed the results of her makeover on Instagram, complete with a nose emoji to further press the point.\n\nAdmitting that a bit of swelling was still present in the wake of the procedure less than two weeks earlier, Olindo claimed during an interview on Bravo TV that she decided to take advantage of the show\u2019s post-season hiatus to undergo the procedure. It stated it was something she had wanted to do since she was eight years old. She also said she suffered no pain at all while on the operating table.\n\nEven before she shared the news, fans on social media pointed out that she didn\u2019t quite look the same. However, after commenting on the change, Olindo got a few negative responses and quickly defended her decision. She noted she was happy about the effect of the results on her self-esteem and would do it again.\n\ninquisitr.com\n\nHer rhinoplasty venture might help her move on after splitting from Conover, a relationship that dominated story arcs during seasons three and four of Southern Charm. Olindo originally met Conover in South Carolina at the College of Charleston, but they actually started dating after they graduated.\n\nThe most recent season saw the two try to navigate stormy waters as audiences watched their relationship start to unravel, especially when Olindo and Conover underwent therapy to keep their connection from further fraying. Unfortunately, the twosome called it quits in September.\n\nEven after the breakup, Olindo claims she's still the best of friends with Conover, adding that he provided a lot of support for her in a text regarding her nose job.\n\nThe two will also remain in the cast of the forthcoming fifth season of Southern Charm, which recently promoted recurring personality Chelsea Meissner to become part of the core ensemble. That decision seems to be a no-brainer, considering Meissner was at the center of a three-way relationship that sparked plenty of interest among viewers.\n\nMischa Barton Reveals She Was The One Killing Off Her 'The O.C.'
