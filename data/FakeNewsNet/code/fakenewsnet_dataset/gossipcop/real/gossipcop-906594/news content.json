It was definitely the most romantic moment of my life. Every detail of the surprise was stunning and I\u2019m still in shock,\u201d Kent tells PEOPLE of Emmett\u2019s proposal.\n\nRELATED: All the Celeb Couples Who Got Engaged in 2018 \u2014 So Far\n\nImage zoom Lala Kent Josafat De La Toba Photography\n\nEmmett had set up a screen for her to watch one of her favorite shows, Friends, before the screen went black and showed a video of the pair and all their memories together, including moments with their families. At the end, Emmett got on his knee and proposed. As he placed the diamond engagement ring on her finger, a private fireworks display went off in the background.\n\n\u201cI keep looking down at my ring finger. I\u2019m just so happy to say we are officially engaged. We are so excited to start planning the rest of our lives together and I\u2019m excited to put as much detail as Randall did in our engagement into our wedding!\u201d Kent says.\n\nRELATED: The Most Jaw-Dropping Celebrity Engagement Rings\n\nImage zoom Randall Emmett and Lala Kent Josafat De La Toba Photography\n\n\u201cI immediately started to think I can\u2019t wait to tell my parents we are engaged!

I believe my father was definitely with us last night in spirit, which makes me even happier and our parents are thrilled!\u201d the bride-to-be says.\n\nRELATED: Lala Kent\u2019s Vanderpump Rules
