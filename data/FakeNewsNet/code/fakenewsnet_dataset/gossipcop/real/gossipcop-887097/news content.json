The 29-year-old actress shared a photo to Instagram holding up her breast pump while in the back of the car bringing her to the event.\n\n\u201cOn my way to present at @variety \u2018s #powerofwomen luncheon and this is my hot date,\u201d she captioned the photo. \u201cKidding. I have another hot date. But this thing is definitely our third wheel.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Brown/Getty Images\n\nReed and Somerhalder revealed that while vacationing in Barcelona, Spain, in 2016, the actor went into his wife\u2019s bag and threw out her birth control pills. \u201cIt was the beginning of the pack, so I had to pop all those suckers out,\u201d Somerhalder said.\n\nThe couple laughed about the incident, going on to share that the decision to start a family was made together with their close friends so they could all hopefully raise their children together.\n\nBut some people felt that the couple\u2019s comments were troubling, with one article accusing Somerhalder of trying to \u201cforce\u201d Reed \u201cinto pregnancy.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed Expecting First Child\n\nInitially, Reed took a strong stance against the writer and critics , addressing the backlash on Twitter.\n\n\u201cDear writer. Here\u2019s my note to you on irresponsible journalism,\u201d the Twilight alum wrote, alongside a screenshot of a lengthier message addressing an \u201carticle this morning claiming my husband tried to \u2018force (me) into pregnancy?!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you actually listen to the podcast (which I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t) you\u2019ll hear how \u2018unforced\u2019 I felt,\u201d wrote Reed. \u201cHa! Also, \u2018unconsented\u2019 bull\u2014- is you speaking on my behalf in a story admittedly taken out of context for the purpose of stirring up drama WITHOUT my approval.\u201d\n\nA note from us\u2026 pic.twitter.com/3WNmrGYS7M \u2014 Nikki Reed (@NikkiReed_I_Am) September 23, 2017\n\nReed later released a joint statement from her and Somerhalder on her Twitter page saying, \u201cTo anyone who has been affected by reproductive coercion, we are deeply sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never expected a lighthearted interview we did poking fun at EACH OTHER and how WE chose together to get pregnant,\u201d they continued. \u201cA goofy moment in Barcelona with our two best friends and the anticipation of our journey together as we went from two to three, to turn into something representing a very serious matter.\u201c", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/sydney-loofe1.jpg",
