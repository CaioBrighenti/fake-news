They are one of the few couples to stay together, and they are the only couple to have a child already. Us Weekly shared the details about their new show that will air on Lifetime. The couple met three years ago on the day they got married. Jamie was actually on The Bachelor before joining the show, Married at First Sight.\n\nThe new show will be called Married at Fight Sight: Jamie and Doug Plus One. This show will be all about parenthood. If you don\u2019t know Jamie\u2019s story, she had a miscarriage and, six months later, got pregnant with their daughter. The couple had a rough time with the miscarriage but couldn\u2019t be happier about their rainbow baby. They named their little girl Henley Grace.\n\nJamie and Doug were a couple that a lot of people thought might not make it. She was really unsure about their relationship at the start, but then they fell in love, and it all worked out. They are actually great together. Jamie fell in love with Doug, but it did take her a bit to get there. She seemed really unsure at first. Now, Jamie and Doug are one of the best couples from the show, and the fans love seeing that this show can work for someone like it did for these two.\n\nThe show has been filming for awhile because it will document the birth of their daughter and how they are as new parents. Married at First Sight: Jamie and Doug Plus One premieres on Lifetime on Tuesday, December 19, at 8 p.m. ET. In the following two weeks, you will get to see two 30-minute shows about Doug and Jamie.
