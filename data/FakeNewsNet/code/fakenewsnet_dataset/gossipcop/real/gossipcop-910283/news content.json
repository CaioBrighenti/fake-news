She did just that on Tuesday, the first day of her and Prince William 's royal tour of Norway and Sweden, when they stopped for a round of bandy hockey at Stockholm's Vasaparken park. According to the BBC , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge watched a game of bandy before competing against each other in a shootout, during which Kate scored one goal and Will scored two.\n\nPhotos and videos from the event, some of which were shared on the official Kensington Palace Twitter account, show the duo's fierce face-off. Though it takes the royal couple a few tries to get the hang of the sport, they both catch on pretty quickly and appear to be having the time of their lives out on the ice. Kate, wearing a black coat, black jeans, a purple scarf, and a black snow hat with a fluffy pompom on top, smacked her first two shots far away from the net before expertly aiming one past the goalie, while Will, also in a pompom-topped hat, only missed his first shot before making the next two.\n\nAnna Widing, a 29-year-old international bandy player, coached Will and Kate before they took to the ice. \"I could see that maybe they like to beat each other,\" Widing told the BBC . \"It was a privilege for us to show our sport to them.\"\n\nWe can only assume that the unfailingly polite Kate went easy on her husband. The expectant mother , who is an avid skier, former college athlete, and pro at playing volleyball in heels , has previously spoken about her love of sports. \"I love cheering on teams and athletes that I am passionate about. I love the physical challenge sport presents and the mental strength it gives us all,\" she said at SportsAid 's 40th anniversary dinner in 2016. \"And I love the way it so often brings people together to work as part of a team.\"", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/593078c67aa20602eb6036b9/1:1/w_125/01-Monique_And_Carlos_1044.JPG", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5d03aee45c6cf866da32cc07/1:1/w_125/Will-George-wave.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a708618fec03e371b046635/master/pass/GettyImages-912058504.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a708618fec03e371b046635/1:1/w_767/GettyImages-912058504.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5bc49605a9dc642d7745b9b3/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1051952284.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a708618fec03e371b046635/master/pass/GettyImages-912058504.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/kate-middleton-competes-prince-william-hockey", "title": "Pregnant Kate Middleton Competes With Prince William in a Hockey Shootout", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On the first day of their royal tour of Norway and Sweden, Kate Middleton and Prince William played a round of bandy hockey at Vasaparken in Stockholm.", "og": {"description": "She definitely could've won.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a708618fec03e371b046635/master/pass/GettyImages-912058504.jpg", "title": "Kate Middleton Let Prince William Win in a Hockey Shootout in Sweden", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/kate-middleton-competes-prince-william-hockey", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She definitely could've won.", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a708618fec03e371b046635/master/pass/GettyImages-912058504.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Kate Middleton Let Prince William Win in a Hockey Shootout in Sweden", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/kate-middleton-competes-prince-william-hockey", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "snd,Kate Middleton,Prince William", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,snd,Kate Middleton,Prince William"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
