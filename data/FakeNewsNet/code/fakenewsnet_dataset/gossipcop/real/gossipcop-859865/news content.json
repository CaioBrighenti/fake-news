Blige has been ordered to pay her estranged husband Martin \u201cKendu\u201d Isaacs $30,000/month in temporary spousal support, according to various reports.\n\nThe singer, 46, filed for divorce in July 2016 after 12 years of marriage. Despite Blige\u2019s attempts to argue that their prenuptial agreement waived any spousal support, she\u2019ll have to pay Isaacs dating back to September, according to E! Online.\n\nIsaacs originally requested for $129,319 per month, but a judge ordered a lot less be paid.\n\nIn April, Blige claimed in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that Isaacs spent more than $420,000 during their marriage on \u201ctravel charges\u201d that involved his girlfriend, not her.\n\nBlige also claimed that Isaacs drives a Mercedes that she pre-paid the lease on and that he refuses to turn over possession of her \u201cGrammy and other achievement awards.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Hillary Clinton Talks to Mary J.
