While he sang the 1983 tune, he was joined by the SNL cast members and the evening\u2019s musical guest, Styles, 23.\n\nAnd while the former One Direction singer only appeared for approximately 15 seconds, his charming (and funny!) dance moves and irresistible smile essentially stole the show.\n\nJimmy Fallon's Most Hilarious Talk Show Games\n\nLater on, Styles performed his new single, \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d and debuted a second song, \u201cEver Since New York,\u201d from his upcoming debut self-titled solo album.\n\nSaturday Night Live airs on NBC Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
