He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Beyonc\u00e9 Instagram\n\nThe father of three also revealed how the couple\u2019s firstborn, 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy, ended up rapping a freestyle on his new album, 4:44, while they were in the recording studio together.\n\n\u201cShe got the headphones and she climbed on the little stool, and then she just started rapping,\u201d JAY-Z said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, s\u2014.\u2019 I haver [her full freestyle] on my phone. Five minutes! Five minutes of her doing that.\u201d\n\nHe also touched on the hook that went viral after the song was released in early July.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Beyonc\u00e9 Shares First Photo of Twins Sir and Rumi Carter\n\n\u201cShe kept doing that \u2018boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh, she understands the concept of a hook,'\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s 5, and she understands the concept of a hook. I was like, \u2018What the f\u2014 is going on here?\u2019 One of the great memories.\u201d\n\nBesides talking about his oldest daughter\u2019s music skills, the Grammy Award winner said his family will be joining him on tour.\n\n\u201cI booked the tour for October so I could have at least four months to just really bond and see their fingers and s\u2014 like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be with me [on tour] anyway, but I\u2019m just saying, like, [I needed] a space where I\u2019m not doing anything,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m just focused on them. I\u2019m not thinking about a show at night or anything like that. That\u2019s why the tour is so far away from the release of the album.\u201d", "images":
