Sequins and dazzle worthy of a figure-skater (a la her I, Tonya character, Tonya Harding), statement-making black, and blush pink tones.\n\nThe former Neighbours star has been putting in serious hours walking red (and pink) carpets in the lead up to the Academy Awards on Monday, including awards shows and I, Tonya premieres around the world.\n\nAt the Golden Globes, Robbie battled the flu but still managed to turn heads in Gucci.\n\nThe dress was later sold via eBay for Charity, the auction site\u2019s philanthropy arm, with proceeds from 39 black designer gowns and suits worn by Robbie, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Tracee Ellis Ross and others donated to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defence Fund.\n\nRobbie has also been matching her frocks to the I, Tonya-themed palette of pink.\n\nAt the movie\u2019s Paris premiere, Robbie wore a blush-coloured Rodarte dress, and went back to black at the BAFTAs, wearing Givenchy at Royal Albert Hall.\n\nShe sported a custom Louis Vuitton gown (above) in London, described as \u201cDynasty-level sparkle and sex appeal\u201d by US Vogue.\n\nBack on Aussie shores, Robbie wore light pink, this time by Australian designer Michael Lo Sordo for I, Tonya\u2019s Sydney premiere.\n\nRobbie has proven she has serious cred behind the scenes while promoting I, Tonya \u2014 a movie she stars in a co-produced.\n\n\u201cThe weight has never been on my shoulders in this way,\u201d Robbie told Stellar magazine this month, about producing I, Tonya, as well as acting in it.\n\n\u201cAnd to be a producer on this (means) I can\u2019t blame anyone else if people don\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say, \u2018the filmmakers made some bad choices! Because, well, I was a part of all those choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this sucks, it\u2019s my fault in large part.\u201d\n\nShe brought her A-game to the SAG Awards with a Miu Miu silk chiffon gown, teamed with an ostrich feather \u201cbelt\u201d. She opted for another Louis Vuitton frock at the Producers Guild Awards (as you do).\n\nSporting more casual looks for daytime events, Robbie wore short and sweet outfits to the BAFTAs nominees\u2019 party, when she sat front row at New York fashion week, and to the annual Academy Awards\u2019 luncheon.\n\nEach time, the shorter looks were teamed with strappy stilettos.\n\nShe showed her support for Australian designers whens he was honoured at the G-Day USA gala in Los Angeles, where she wore floral Zimmermann.\n\nEven when Robbie isn\u2019t on the red carpet, she is still on-trend.\n\nShe and her husband, producer Tom Ackerley, made a low-key trip to Melbourne last week for a friend\u2019s wedding ... just days before the Oscars.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph reported that the couple was back to attend the wedding of one Robbie\u2019s best friends, Georgia Graham, and James Rollin.\n\nAt the wedding, Robbie\u2019s place card simply read \u201cMrs. Tom Ackerley\u201d and she wore a red-hot gown by The Vampire\u2019s Wife, which retails for $AU2,377.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t the Oscars, but Robbie sure looked ready for a red carpet.", "images":
