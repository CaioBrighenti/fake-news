That\u2019s why for 2018, the \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d singer is vowing to kick them to the curb with a battle cry of body positivity that just about everyone could stand to hear.\n\nPosting a shot of herself posing in a striped one-piece on a dreamy, sunny beach, the 25-year-old admitted she doesn\u2019t always see perfection in herself. \u201cSo, I\u2019m insecure about my legs in this picture,\u201d she revealed.\n\nStill, she had a pretty good reason for looking beyond her own perceived \u201cflaws.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m posting it because I look so happy\u2026\u201d (she really does!)\u201d \u2026and this year I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m letting go of my perfectionism and embracing freedom from self criticism.\u201d\n\nThe former Disney star continued on to explain what a huge step this was for her in particular, having struggled with an eating disorder in the past. \u201cLearning to love my body the way it is is challenging but life-changing. Giving up my eating disorder has been the most challenging journey of my life but I work every day towards solid recovery, even if I mess up sometimes,\u201d the singer shared.\n\nLovato has been plenty open about her eating disorder in the past, opening up about a recent relapse in her YouTube documentary, Simply Complicated, and posting powerful images about her recovery back in October.\n\nIf this latest snap is any indication, it looks like she\u2019ll continue to share her journey with her followers in the New Year, telling followers, \u201cToday I\u2019m feeling strong. You all can do it too. It IS possible. Thank you God for this new chapter in my life. #EDrecovery #happyAF\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re #happyAF *for* you, Demi!\n\nWhat do you think about Demi Lovato\u2019s vow to let go of her perfectionism and self-criticism?
