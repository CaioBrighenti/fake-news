She\u2019s definitely in the running for moi\u2019s new BFF.\u201d She also spoke to the outlet about their newly formed bond, saying, \u201cI love dropping in on Blake\u2026 she\u2019s funny, lovely, and talented\u2026 and of course it doesn\u2019t hurt that her hunky husband Ryan likes to walk around the house with his shirt off.\u201d Oh, my!\n\nThe All I See Is You actress didn\u2019t seem to mind Piggy\u2019s admiration for her significant other, posting the same photo and writing, \u201cEat it, Peppa,\u201d in reference to that other famous British cartoon pig, Peppa Pig. Their shared pictorial, which features the gals clasping hands in coordinating maribou Miu Miu feather coats, was shot by Alasdair McLellan.\n\nAnd clearly, Piggy isn\u2019t jealous about Lively sharing the cover of Love Magazine with her amphibian ex, Kermit the Frog. \u201cThe lovers, the dreamers, and me,\u201d Lively joked of the cover snap, which showcases Kermie in his own stylish hooded green and white outerwear.\n\nThe shot was one of several Alasdair took for the magazine, which also featured Kendall Jenner and model Jean Campbell posing alongside Jim Henson\u2019s beloved characters.\n\nWe, for one, are loving every second of this shoot. Who knew Kermit was so in vogue?\n\nWhat do you think of Blake and The Muppets\u2019 latest looks?
