Though Markle is extremely pretty and she stars in a TV show, you would never call her a \u201cshowgirl.\u201d She is too serious, too well brought up. (And outside of Vegas, who\u2019s called a \u201cshowgirl\u201d anymore?) \u201cGrounded\u201d is the word that is often used to describe her. \u201cI was born and raised in Los Angeles, a California girl who lives by the ethos that most things can be cured with either yoga, the beach, or a few avocados,\u201d she once wrote. Until recently, she maintained a popular lifestyle blog called The Tig. She is a self-described foodie, a passion, incidentally, given to her character on Suits. \u201cI mean, this bread is so good!\u201d she enthuses over the delicious meal she prepared. \u201cIt\u2019s that perfect crunch and then the softness. They call it the \u2018crumb,\u2019 all of these little holes\u2014oh!\u201d Suits, in which Markle plays ambitious paralegal turned lawyer Rachel Zane, first brought the actress to wide attention. (Before that she\u2019d appeared briefly in the movies A Lot Like Love and Horrible Bosses and had minor roles on television in the science-fiction drama Fringe and the soap opera General Hospital, among others.) I asked the boyishly attractive, 36-year-old actor Patrick J. Adams, who plays the likable but fraudulent lawyer Mike Ross, Rachel\u2019s love interest on Suits, to describe the series and its popularity. ROYAL TREATMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never defined myself by my relationship,\u201d says Markle, who adds that she and Prince Harry were \u201cquietly dating for about six months before it became news.\u201d Photograph by Peter Lindbergh. Styled by Jessica Diehl. \u201cGetting to 100 episodes is pretty surreal,\u201d Adams says. \u201cI never thought that a story about six people working in a law firm in New York City would be something that would capture people\u2019s interest all over the globe. I was backpacking through New Zealand a couple of years ago and stopped to help a Swedish guy who had twisted his ankle. He looked up at me, and his eyes went wide, and all he could talk about was how badly he wanted Mike and Rachel to figure things out.\u201d Mike Ross\u2019s relationship with Rachel Zane is one of those long, simmering teases that take several episodes to come to a boil, but it was clear from their first meeting that they were meant to be together. \u201cI think Mike and Rachel are a classic Romeo-and-Juliet story,\u201d Adams believes. \u201cThey come from totally different sides of the tracks. Rachel has taken the path well traveled, worked hard, and followed the rules of the game. Mike is a naturally gifted, brilliant guy but has followed exactly none of the rules.\u201d When it came to casting Rachel Zane, \u201cwe needed somebody in the role that was absolutely engaging, relatable, young enough, who is beautiful in a non-traditional way, and who had an authenticity,\u201d says Bonnie Hammer, chairman of NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Group. Aaron Korsh, the show\u2019s creator, recalls that Rachel Zane was particularly challenging to cast because the role required \u201ctoughness and attitude while still being likable. . . . We all looked at each other [after Markle\u2019s screen test] like, Wow, this is the one! I think it\u2019s because Meghan has the ability to be smart and sharp but without losing her sweetness.\u201d When she auditioned for the role, Markle showed up in black jeans, a plum-colored spaghetti-strap top, and heels. It suddenly occurred to her that for the screen test she needed to look less casual and more like a lawyer. She dashed into an H&M and bought a little black dress for $35. Sure enough, she was asked to change into the dress, which she hadn\u2019t even tried on. Thank God it fit. \u201cMy parents had been so supportive,\u201d she told V.F., \u201cwatching me audition, trying to make ends meet, taking all the odds-and-ends jobs to pay my bills. I was doing calligraphy, and I was a hostess at a restaurant\u2014and all those things that actors do. My father knew how hard it is for an actor to get work, so he above all people was so proud that I was able to beat the odds.\u201d One of the strongest bonds Prince Harry and Markle share is their philanthropy. For Markle, it began at an early age. Her mother, Doria Ragland, made sure that her little girl knew about the greater world and its political and economic challenges when she was growing up in Los Angeles. FIT FOR A PRINCE\n\n\u201cThe people who are close to me anchor me in knowing who I am,\u201d Markle says. \u201cThe rest is noise.\u201d Photograph by Peter Lindbergh. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Meghan\u2019s father, Thomas Markle, was a successful lighting director in Hollywood; he lit the popular sitcom Married . . . with Children and, for 35 years, General Hospital. Markle recalled, \u201cEvery day after school for 10 years, I was on the set of Married . . . with Children, which was a really funny and perverse place for a little girl in a Catholic-school uniform to grow up.\u201d Markle says, \u201cWhat\u2019s so incredible, you know, is that my parents split up when I was two, [but] I never saw them fight. We would still take vacations together. My dad would come on Sundays to drop me off, and we\u2019d watch Jeopardy! eating dinner on TV trays, the three of us. . . . We were still so close-knit.\u201d When she turned 18, she left for Northwestern University, in Evanston, Illinois\u2014becoming the first person in her family to graduate from college\u2014and double-majored in theater and international relations. In line with her international-relations major, Markle worked at the U.S. Embassy in Argentina her senior year, \u201cso I had been in a completely different world and then suddenly jumped into this one.\u201d Markle thinks her social awareness began during the South-Central riots, in Los Angeles, sparked by the police beating of Rodney King, in 1991, and the subsequent riots in 1992, when she was 11 years old. \u201cThey had let us go home [from school] during the riots and there was ash everywhere.\u201d As the ash from street fires sifted down on suburban lawns, Markle remembers, she said, \u201cOh, my God, Mommy, it\u2019s snowing!\u201d \u201cNo, Flower, it\u2019s not snow,\u201d Doria answered. \u201cGet in the house.\u201d\n\nMarkle\u2019s friends, family, and fellow actors on Suits are respectful of her relationship with Prince Harry, which has come under harsh criticism in the U.K. Tabloids report that Queen Elizabeth will be hesitant to sanction such a match for her grandson, following the ancient rule barring Catholics, commoners, and divorc\u00e9es. Though not raised Catholic, Markle graduated from a Catholic high school and was married for almost two years to producer Trevor Engelson, and she adds a new wrinkle: her mother is black, her father white. Criticism of Markle has been snob-ridden, racist, and uninformed. The trolls have really gone after her. Last November, the Daily Star Online announced, \u201cPrince Harry could marry into gangster royalty\u2014his new love is from a crime ridden Los Angeles neighborhood\u201d; \u201cthe royal\u2019s future mother-in-law still lives in Crenshaw, surrounded by bloodbath robberies and drug-induced violence.\u201d \u201cI told her, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be who you are, Meghan. You can\u2019t hide,\u2019 \u201d says Serena Williams. How does Markle handle the tabloid nonsense about her and Harry? \u201cI can tell you that at the end of the day I think it\u2019s really simple,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u2019s perception. Nothing about me changed. I\u2019m still the same person that I am, and I\u2019ve never defined myself by my relationship.\u201d The media frenzy seems to bother the prince more than it does Markle. The official statement issued from Kensington Palace by his communications secretary read, in part, \u201cMeghan Markle has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. . . . Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle\u2019s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her.\u201d As for Markle, she prefers what the British call \u201costriching.\u201d She says, \u201cI don\u2019t read any press. I haven\u2019t even read press for Suits. The people who are close to me anchor me in knowing who I am. The rest is noise.\u201d Photograph by Peter Lindbergh. Styled by Jessica Diehl.\n\nMarkle\u2019s parents \u201ccrafted the world around me to make me feel like I wasn\u2019t different, but special,\u201d as she wrote in a 2015 essay for Elle. As dolls in the 1980s were generally sold in sets of black and white, for Christmas one year her father bought \u201ca black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each color. My dad had taken the sets apart and customized my family.\u201d Problems began in the seventh grade, when she had to complete a mandatory census by checking one of four boxes: \u201cwhite, black, Hispanic, or Asian.\u201d The pale, freckled, curly-haired Markle felt that to choose either white or black would be a rejection of one of her parents. Her teacher told her to check \u201cCaucasian\u201d because she looked white, but she couldn\u2019t. She ended up leaving the boxes unchecked. \u201cI left my identity blank\u2014a question mark, an absolute incomplete\u2014much like how I felt,\u201d she once said. Because she is light-skinned and has not made an issue of being bi-racial\u2014though she has embraced it\u2014she has auditioned for white as well as black and Latina roles. There was widespread disbelief among viewers in Season Two of Suits when her black father, a high-powered lawyer played by the charismatic actor Wendell Pierce (of Treme fame), first appeared on the show\u2014most people didn\u2019t think her character, or the actress playing her, was bi-racial. One thing Markle noticed about how she was perceived was that \u201cat almost every photo shoot they would airbrush out\u201d her freckles. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved my freckles,\u201d she now says, so when she was photographed for V.F., she was \u201cthrilled to work with Peter [Lindbergh] because he rarely retouches and he believes in such little makeup. I gave him a big hug and said, \u2018I am so excited to work with you because I know we will finally be able to see my freckles!\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore important, what does Queen Elizabeth think of the prospect of a marriage between her grandson and the American divorc\u00e9e? When asked if she thought the Queen opposed the match, Sally Bedell Smith, who has written biographies of Queen Elizabeth, Princess Diana, and most recently Prince Charles, said, \u201cThe stakes are obviously lower in the case of Harry because he is now fifth in line to the throne [in descending order, the others are Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince George, and Princess Charlotte]. They have to be concerned\u2014William and Harry will always have a special place because, whatever you think of Diana, she has a magical aura that continues. The fact that Harry and William are half Diana . . . that will never go away.\u201d \u201cThe Queen is remarkably open-minded and she\u2019s very tolerant,\u201d Smith observes. William was allowed to cohabit with Kate (Middleton), even though she\u2019s the daughter of \u201ca very middle-class family. The Queen just looked at who Kate was and that she was in love with her grandson, and that she knew how to conduct herself with dignity and discretion, and that was the most important thing. I would imagine that the Queen\u2019s view of this would be: if they\u2019re in love and they\u2019re well suited, then they should proceed.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day I think it\u2019s really simple,\u201d Markle says. \u201cWe\u2019re two people who are really happy.\u201d Bonnie Hammer expressed her concern about Markle\u2019s sudden, international fame. \u201cShe isn\u2019t somebody who was already a celebrity, who had paparazzi tracking her day and night in Hollywood or New York or Toronto. She\u2019s going through something that should be the most glorious and open time in her life, to be able to share, but because of circumstances, that\u2019s very hard.\u201d Markle credits the rock-solid support from her close friends for helping to sustain her. The international tennis great Serena Williams (who recently graced the cover of V.F.) is one of those friends. The two met about seven years ago at the Super Bowl. \u201cHer personality just shines,\u201d Serena said about Markle, who asked her advice on how to handle some of the more extreme results of fame, such as paparazzi showing up at her house and chasing her. \u201cI told her, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be who you are, Meghan. You can\u2019t hide.\u2019 \u201d Another close friend is the Bahrain-born fashion designer Misha Nonoo. They met in Miami through a mutual friend and immediately bonded. \u201cHer greatest strength is her compassion for others,\u201d says Nonoo. \u201cMuch of the work she does is unseen by the public.\u201d Another close friend is the actress Abigail Spencer, who has been a Suits cast member. When asked why she thinks Harry was drawn to Markle, Spencer says, \u201cShe\u2019s got warm elegance, though her style is hard to pin down. It\u2019s classy and timeless. When you\u2019re talking to her, you feel like you\u2019re the only person on the planet. And it\u2019s just wonderful to see her so in love.\u201d STRONG SUITS\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful to see her so in love,\u201d says actress Abigail Spencer, a close friend.
