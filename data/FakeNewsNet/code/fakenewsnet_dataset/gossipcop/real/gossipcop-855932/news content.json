I don't want it to happen because it would make you that much better than me, and I just don't want that to happen,\" he joked with his friend and co-star.\n\nWhen Norton pressed Chastain on whether she would be a \"cheerleader\" for Johnson, she said she definitely would. \"Have you seen his Instagram?\" she asked.\n\nRebel Wilson also chimed in, telling Norton she would be \"prepared to donate\" to a potential Johnson campaign.\n\nThe rumors of a Johnson presidential run picked up steam after the actor told GQ that he thinks a campaign is \"a real possibility\" in June. In October Johnson continued to fan the flames of fan speculation when he commented, \"I think 'The People's President' has a really nice ring to that. I'll just say that,\" on a panel at Los Angeles Comic Con.\n\nJohnson and Hart appeared on The Graham Norton Show to promote Jumanji, which will be released in theaters Dec. 20.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2018/09/red_dead_redemption_2_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/blogs/promoflag-thr-latest-news.png?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/scale_crop_768_433/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2019/07/gettyimages-1142776438_copy.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Kilkenny", "Aaron Couch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dwayne-johnson-jokes-he-may-not-run-president-because-kevin-hart-will-sabotage-campaign-1065826", "title": "Dwayne Johnson Jokes He May Not Run for President Because Kevin Hart Will \"Sabotage the Campaign\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "On 'The Graham Norton Show' the 'Jumanji' actor worries his friend and co-star will ruin his presidential chances, but Jessica Chastain and Rebel Wilson offer their support.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dwayne-johnson-jokes-he-may-not-run-president-because-kevin-hart-will-sabotage-campaign-1065826", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson Jokes He May Not Run for President Because Kevin Hart Will \"Sabotage the Campaign\"", "description": "On 'The Graham Norton Show' the 'Jumanji' actor worries his friend and co-star will ruin his presidential chances, but Jessica Chastain and Rebel Wilson offer their support.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Dwayne Johnson Jokes He May Not Run for President Because Kevin Hart Will \"Sabotage the Campaign\"", "description": "On 'The Graham Norton Show' the 'Jumanji' actor worries his friend and co-star will ruin his presidential chances, but Jessica Chastain and Rebel Wilson offer their support.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/dwayne-johnson-jokes-he-may-not-run-president-because-kevin-hart-will-sabotage-campaign-1065826", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Dwayne Johnson Jokes He May Not Run for President Because Kevin Hart Will \"Sabotage the Campaign\"", "sailthru.description": "On 'The Graham Norton Show' the 'Jumanji' actor worries his friend and co-star will ruin his presidential chances, but Jessica Chastain and Rebel Wilson offer their support.", "sailthru.author": "Katie Kilkenny", "sailthru.channel": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.vertical": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-08 11:49:39", "sailthru.tags": "Heat Vision, Movies, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, International, Late-Night TV"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXBlB2ZD1rw"], "publish_date": 1512751779.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
