Godzilla: King of the Monsters follows Madison Russell (Brown), who gets kidnapped along with her mother by a mysterious group that we can say pretty confidently is Monarch \u2014 the secret organization created to hunt and study monsters like Godzilla.\n\nGodzilla: King of the Monsters will feature more monsters this time around, including King Ghidorah, Mothra and Rodan, some of the most iconic characters in the Godzilla franchise. An official synopsis for the movie can be read below.\n\nThe new story follows the heroic efforts of the cryptozoological agency Monarch as its members face off against a battery of god sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three headed King Ghidorah. When these ancient superspecies, thought to be mere myths, rise again, they all vie for supremacy, leaving humanity\u2019s very existence hanging in the balance.\n\nEdwards isn\u2019t returning for the sequel; Godzilla: King of the Monsters will be directed by Michael Dougherty. The film is set to hit theaters March 31, 2019.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64719533/twosmiles.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64722428/F1_2019_win64_do_2019_04_08_20_00_26_63.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64719404/Bloodstained_demon_127_cover.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7qLER0OjygpHwDrSeK7gixOO0hY=/64x0:1164x576/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11724755/Screen_Shot_2018_07_21_at_2.33.23_PM_1.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64722093/IMG_2041.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64722691/Pokemon_Direct_2.27.2019_31-4_screenshot.0.0.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64719636/Bloodstained_Entrance_blood_fountain.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7qLER0OjygpHwDrSeK7gixOO0hY=/64x0:1164x576/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11724755/Screen_Shot_2018_07_21_at_2.33.23_PM_1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/21/17588504/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-trailer-sdcc-2018", "title": "Godzilla: King of the Monsters Comic-Con trailer teases a kaiju-filled sequel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Polygon", "author": "Julia Alexander", "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-21T14:34:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-21T14:34:39-04:00"}, "fb": {"pages": "340327135979921,1121292284586403,353942168328519,231096643968522", "app_id": 549923288395304}, "style-tools": "https://www.polygon.com/style/community/405/1b8e95dff5d693af3ed21ed146098477/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "A first look at Legendary Entertainment\u2019s Godzilla sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, premiered at San Diego Comic-Con today.", "og": {"description": "Godzilla isn\u2019t alone", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7qLER0OjygpHwDrSeK7gixOO0hY=/64x0:1164x576/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11724755/Screen_Shot_2018_07_21_at_2.33.23_PM_1.png", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Polygon", "title": "Godzilla: King of the Monsters Comic-Con trailer teases a kaiju-filled sequel", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/21/17588504/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-trailer-sdcc-2018"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/21/17588504/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-trailer-sdcc-2018", "title": "Godzilla: King of the Monsters Comic-Con trailer teases a kaiju-filled sequel", "description": "Godzilla isn\u2019t alone", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNpkXqMKp9ouMcEY77jxZSn2xuk=/38x0:1190x576/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11724755/Screen_Shot_2018_07_21_at_2.33.23_PM_1.png", "site": "Polygon"}, "sailthru.title": "Godzilla: King of the Monsters Comic-Con trailer teases a kaiju-filled sequel", "sailthru.tags": "general,polygon,front-page,movies,sdcc,entertainment", "sailthru.description": "A first look at Legendary Entertainment\u2019s Godzilla sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, premiered at San Diego Comic-Con today.", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-21 14:34:39", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZVvMGeDyjPLlpizILwveDI0KPw=/102x0:1126x576/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60444557/Screen_Shot_2018_07_21_at_2.33.23_PM_1.0.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TNkCA2balDk2JvT4Dx9AJlFnX9w=/326x0:902x576/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60444557/Screen_Shot_2018_07_21_at_2.33.23_PM_1.0.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/405/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000x1000.7014.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0052", "outbrainsection": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532145600.0, "source": "https://www.polygon.com", "summary": ""}
