No phones here, see y\u2019all soon,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also shared a snapshot of his bathroom inside the facility. \u201cRehab privileges- having my own bathroom, i can piss and floss simultaneously, and I get to use my phone an hour a day!\u201d he wrote.\n\nMargera was arrested by California Highway Patrol officers around 8 a.m. on Sunday in Los Angeles, Officer Juan Galvan \u2014 a public information officer with the CHP\u2019s Southern Division \u2014 previously confirmed to PEOPLE.\n\nAccording to Galvan, CHP officers were in the area for unrelated business when they observed Margera on his cell phone, which prompted an interaction. At that point, \u201cthey noticed signs of possible intoxication and conducted standard field sobriety tests,\u201d Galvan said. \u201cHe was subsequently arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.\u201d\n\nMargera\u2019s bail was set at $15,000, and he was released a little after 2:30 p.m. on Sunday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department.\n\nOn Tuesday, Margera\u2019s mother April told Page Six that her son was heading to rehab in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cHe feels a lot better,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had a bad night. He\u2019s embarrassed by it. He\u2019s mad at himself for being stupid. Now he just wants to pick up the pieces and move forward for himself and for his family.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Former Jackass Star Bam Margera Is A Dad\n\nThe incident marks Margera\u2019s first DUI arrest. Last September, Margera \u2014 who welcomed his first child, son Phoenix Wolf Margera, with wife Nicole Boyd in December \u2014 opened up to PEOPLE about learning to skateboard again after years of alcohol abuse, crediting the sport with helping him get his life back on track after hitting rock bottom.\n\n\u201cI took a five-year hiatus from skating because I had bone spurs, so instead I was making money by doing nightclub appearances, which basically was shooting photos and taking shots with the locals,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I was s\u2014bag wasted every night, and eventually was like, \u2018This has to stop.\u2019 Once I woke up in my own puke and p\u2013, I knew I had to cut it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just reached a point where drinking got really old,\u201d he added. \u201cI just looked at the big picture, like, \u2018What am I doing? I\u2019m not doing anything, just sitting in a bar in Westchester cracking jokes with the locals.\u2019 So I stopped.\u201d\n\nMargera\u2019s Jackass costar Ryan Dunn died in 2011 while driving under the influence of alcohol.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bgus_1632970_003.jpg?crop=3px%2C74px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630",
