How dare any one of you judge me and say that on a social platform. It doesn\u2019t make you any better of a person to cast judgment on others and sit in the seat of mockers. I will always love Chris and Jo knows that. And I will always love Jo. The beautiful thing about love is that it multiplies as new blessings come into your life.\u201d", "images":
