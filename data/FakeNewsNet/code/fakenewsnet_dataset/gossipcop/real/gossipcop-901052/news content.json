On Monday, the married couple stepped out for a night out in London, where they supported the Motor Neuron Disease Association\u2019s Carol Concert. The night marked their first public appearance since announcing in November that they\u2019re expecting a second child together.\n\nFor the occasion, Eddie did what Eddie does best and kept it super dapper in a suit with a straight tie and matching pocket square. Hannah covered her growing baby bump in a green coat with oversize buttons, pockets, and matching jeans.\n\nImage zoom Doug Peters/PA Wire/PA Images\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Iris May Redmayne, in June 2016. Last year, Eddie opened up about parenthood on Ellen.\n\n\u201cBefore you\u2019re a parent, you sort of hear people talking about [not getting any sleep] and suddenly you\u2019re the guy who\u2019s like floating in a sort of constant jet lag with a constant IV of caffeine. So yes, I\u2019ve become that person. It\u2019s worth every minute,\u201d he said.\n\nIt sounds like they\u2019re taking parenthood by storm.", "images":
