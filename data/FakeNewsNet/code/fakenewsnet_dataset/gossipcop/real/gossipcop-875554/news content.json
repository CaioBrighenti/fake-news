Exactly one boob,\" said the former Miss Israel, alluding to a theory in Greek mythology.\n\nContinuing, \"So what are you talking about here? Me having small boobs and small ass? That will make all the difference.\"\n\nGadot also revealed that she and Jenkins wanted Wonder Woman to be strong but feminine.\n\n\"I didn't want to play the cold-hearted warrior. We didn't want to fall into the cliche\u00b4s,\" noted Gadot.\n\nShe also shared that she gets really surprised when people come and ask her \"Are you a feminist?\"\n\nGadot shared, \"People always ask me, 'Are you a feminist?' And I find the question surprising, because I think, 'Yes, of course. Every woman, every man, everyone should be a feminist. Because whoever is not a feminist is a sexist. Me and my younger sister were taught to value ourselves.\"\n\nAdding, \"I had a very sheltered kind of life. There was no TV-watching. It was always 'Take a ball and go play.' In general, I was a good girl, a good student, a pleaser and I was a tomboy, always with wounds and scratches on my knees.\"\n\nThe 2017 remake just reached the USD 800 million-dollar mark in earnings, a fact that doesn't seem to surprise the leading lady.\n\n\"It just shows that the world was ready for a female-driven action movie,\" Gadot said.\n\nDisclaimer :- This story has not been edited by Outlook staff and is auto-generated from news agency feeds.", "images": ["https://www.outlookindia.com/new/images/logo.png", "https://images.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2019/7/11/reservation_1_20190722_100_100.jpg", "https://www.outlookindia.com/images/twitter_short.png", "https://images.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2019/7/11/regional_cinema_1_collage_20190722_100_100.jpg", "https://www.outlookindia.com/images/facebook1.png", "https://images.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2019/7/13/Fed-Novak-AP_80_80.jpg", "https://www.outlookindia.com/images/google_plus1.png", "https://images.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2019/7/11/cricket_2_20190722_100_100.jpg", "https://www.outlookindia.com/images/pinterest1.png", "https://images.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2019/7/13/Wasim-Jaffar-AP_80_80.jpg", "https://images.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2019/7/13/Eoin-Morgan-PC-AP_80_80.jpg", "https://www.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/gallery/20170528/mexico-preview_20170529.jpg", "https://www.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/outlook-banner-img.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22214668&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.outlookindia.com/images/linkedin.png", "https://www.outlookindia.com/new/images/newsscroll/logo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/outlook-banner-img.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/gal-gadot-shuts-down-wonder-woman-body-shaming/1131719", "title": "Gal Gadot shuts down 'Wonder Woman' body shaming", "meta_data": {"description": "New York [USA], August 25 : When it comes to being a Wonder Woman on-screen or off-screen, there is no one better than Gal Gadot", "keywords": "Entertainment_Culture,Human Interest,Gal Gadot,United States,New York,rolling stone", "news_keywords": "Entertainment_Culture,Human Interest,Gal Gadot,United States,New York,rolling stone", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "https://www.outlookindia.com/", "title": "Gal Gadot shuts down 'Wonder Woman' body shaming", "description": "New York [USA], August 25 : When it comes to being a Wonder Woman on-screen or off-screen, there is no one better than Gal Gadot", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/outlook-banner-img.gif"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@outlookindia", "url": "https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/gal-gadot-shuts-down-wonder-woman-body-shaming/1131719", "title": "Gal Gadot shuts down 'Wonder Woman' body shaming", "description": "New York [USA], August 25 : When it comes to being a Wonder Woman on-screen or off-screen, there is no one better than Gal Gadot", "image": "https://www.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/outlook-banner-img.gif"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.outlookindia.com", "summary": ""}
