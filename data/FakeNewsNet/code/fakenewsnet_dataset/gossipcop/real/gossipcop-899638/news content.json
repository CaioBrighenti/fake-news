{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/beyonce-gucci-kimono", "text": "Beyonc\u00e9 has always been an all-star when it comes to her maternity style game, and her last two major looks haven't let us down: When she first announced she was having twins, she donned an Agent Provocateur Lorna scalloped underwired bra and sheer veil. Shortly after, she took the stage at the Grammys in a gilded Peter Dundas custom gown and headdress, and left us breathless.\n\nNow Beyonc\u00e9 is at it again. She and Jay-Z sat courtside on Sunday at the NBA All-Star basketball game in New Orleans, and her look definitely made a statement. Queen B dressed like many of us do for a game\u2014distressed jeans, stilettos, white tee\u2014but kicked it up a (major) notch with an extravagant printed silk Gucci kimono from the S/S '17 collection. She accessorized the $21,945 robe, embroidered with tigers and tropical plants, with a $450 Gucci fan.\n\nBlue Ivy, who sat between her famous parents, complemented her mom's look by sporting a chartreuse Gucci dress, denim jacket, and Chuck Taylor kicks.\n\nHere's a view of the kimono from the side:\n\nPhoto by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images Jonathan Bachman\n\nIt's pretty standard to wear distressed denim and a tee to a sporting event, but consider us reminded: Adding a statement piece to the simplest outfit\u2014even if it's just a pair of earrings\u2014is a great way to get some major style points. You don't need a $22,000 kimono, either.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d013145dac63f554b910561/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/0612_bathingsuits_lede.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1441213863/glamour_34-reasons-we-love-beyonce.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d20c97c9443aa00091131e2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-christening-social.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab363c545f472d5ffd422f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-643011494.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d25c756495aa2000a9c5537/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1154845796.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d25e885495aa2000a9c5541/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kendall%2520-%2520kyle%2520kuzma.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d17f38b0e99880008ad03e8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/shutterstock_10241587alede.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Tara Gonzalez", "Kelsey Laffert", "Natasha Reda", "Halie Lesavage"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/beyonce-gucci-kimono", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Wore a $22,000 Gucci Kimono to the NBA All-Star Game", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z sat courtside on Sunday at the NBA All-Star basketball game in New Orleans, and her look definitely made a statement", "keywords": "beyonc\u00e9,fashion,outfit of the day,maternity style", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "That's one way to upgrade jeans and a white tee.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Wore a $22,000 Gucci Kimono to the NBA All-Star Game", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/beyonce-gucci-kimono"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "That's one way to upgrade jeans and a white tee.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Wore a $22,000 Gucci Kimono to the NBA All-Star Game"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
