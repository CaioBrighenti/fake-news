Lindsay is staying at Ben\u2019s new house,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE of the duo. \u201cThey had dinner at Giorgio Baldi last night. They arrived in a limo. They looked happy. They had a quick dinner and then returned to Ben\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nThe two have worked together before, as Affleck is a five-time host of the long-running show and last hosted in May 2013. Read on for more on the TV producer that has captured Affleck\u2019s interest.\n\nShe\u2019s a Buffalo native and went to college in North Carolina\n\nThe 37-year-old producer has New York roots: She\u2019s a native of Buffalo, where her dad is in the housewares and electronic consumer products business, according to The New York Times, and her mom is a sales representative for Gilead Sciences, a biotechnology company. She went to the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill before starting at Saturday Night Live.\n\nShe started working at SNL straight out of college \u2014 and met Matt Damon on her first week\n\nShookus got on the fast track to the comedy world when she started working at SNL as an assistant producer straight after graduating from UNC Chapel Hill. Affleck\u2019s best bud Matt Damon hosted her first week working at the show and she got up close and personal with Bruce Springsteen during his rehearsal as musical guest.\n\n\u201cI was watching Bruce Springsteen perform from 30 feet away on my fourth day,\u201d she said in a 2015 The Hollywood Reporter profile. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018How is this my job?\u2019 \u201c\n\nShookus was eventually bumped up to producer and later won a 2015 Emmy along with the show for its 40th anniversary special. She also went on to work as a producer on Tina Fey\u2019s 30 Rock.\n\nShe discovered SNL heavy-hitters like Kristen Wiig\n\nThe now-producer climbed the ranks until she landed with a high-profile job at the long-running show, working closely with iconic creator Lorne Michaels to pick and choose the talent that makes it on air. Shookus is even responsible for some of the most prolific performers on the show, helping cast Kristen Wiig and the recently departed Vanessa Bayer.\n\n\u201cWhen I started as an assistant at SNL, I got my eyes on Kristen Wiig and was able to bring her for an audition for Lorne Michaels and the other producers,\u201d she told THR. \u201cTurns out, Kristen Wiig can give you some street cred early on.\u201d\n\nShe was married to a fellow SNL producer\n\nShookus was previously married to then-fellow SNL producer Kevin Miller. They were married in 2010 in her native city of Williamsville. The two met on Shookus\u2019 first day at the show. Miller later left SNL and now works for Seth Meyer\u2019s Late Night.\n\nShe has one child\n\nIn her 2015 THR profile, Shookus said her then-2-year-old child was her natural alarm clock in the mornings.\n\n\u201cMy 2-year-old has become my alarm, so on a good day, 7:30 a.m. or 8 a.m. My alarm sounds something like, \u2018MAMA, where ARE yooooou?\u2019 \u201d she said.", "images":
