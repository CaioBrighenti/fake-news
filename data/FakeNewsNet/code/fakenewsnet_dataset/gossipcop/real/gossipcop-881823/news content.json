She wore blue jeans, a black and white patterned blouse and carried a black messenger bag.\n\nUs broke the news that Bilson and Christensen, 36, \u201chave been on the outs for a couple of months.\u201d The pair, who are parents of daughter Briar, 2, met on set of the 2008 film Jumper and got engaged that December. They called off their engagement in 2010, but reconciled shortly after.\n\n\u201cThey are completely, officially done,\u201d the source added to Us. \u201cShe\u2019s full-time back in L.A. He\u2019s in Toronto.\u201d\n\nLast month, the O.C. alum opened up about possibly having a second child with the Star Wars actor. \u201cI may have another child, that\u2019s still up in the air,\u201d she told Lapalme Magazine\u2019s Summer Issue at the time. \u201cI\u2019m having so much fun with the one right now. I want to be happy and content. All the life BS that happens doesn\u2019t matter. You want to be happy, you want your kid to be happy and you want everyone in your life to be healthy and happy.\u201d\n\nThe O.C. Cast: Then and Now\n\n\n\nShe added of working with Christensen: \u201c[Jumper] was an amazing experience. It was the most precious time. We were shooting in Italy and inside the Coliseum\u2026The role was fulfilling, but also everything was fulfilling as a life experience, it was one of the best times. I think anytime you\u2019re on location you feel like you\u2019re away at summer camp in a way. You\u2019re more open and receptive to life experiences than you are at home.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
