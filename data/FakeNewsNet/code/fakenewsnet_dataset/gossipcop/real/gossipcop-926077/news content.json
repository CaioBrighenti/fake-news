I just never thought they would meet up in a Venn diagram of my obsessions. Yet here were are, and it's all thanks to Bethenny Frankel.\n\nIn a new interview with Australia's Kyle and Jackie O Show , Frankel revealed that she once briefly dated Markle's first husband, Trevor Engelson. \"I met this guy as a romantic interest. His name is Trevor,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I met him in Chicago and we were supposed to go out, and I ended up seeing him one time and he\u2019d been texting me. He\u2019s a producer in L.A. He told me that he was married before. He\u2019s divorced [now]. He was married to this girl named Meghan Markle from the TV show Suits .\u201d\n\nApparently, Frankel didn't know anything of Markle at the time but was floored when news of her relationship with Prince Harry went public in 2016. She says, according to Us Weekly , she told Engelson, \"Holy s\u2013t! Your ex is going to be a princess. Is that crazy?\u201d\n\nThe RHONY star says they went on one date, but the relationship was more focused on business than romance. \"He pitched me a TV show idea to produce together about a bunch of businesswomen, which I think we are going to do,\u201d she said. \u201cHe looks a little bit like my ex [Jason Hoppy], which scares me. We bypassed the romantics and went into the business. But I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s something there. There\u2019s something salacious about doing a TV project with Meghan Markle\u2019s ex.\u201d Not to mention the PR possibilities, right?\n\nEngelson and Markle married in 2011 and divorced in 2013. According to Deadline , he's also working on a scripted show about a man whose ex-wife marries a British prince, forcing him to share custody with the royal family. But frankly, we're way more excited about the Harry and Meghan Lifetime movie .\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nThe First Trailer for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Lifetime Movie Is Really Something\n\nLuann de Lesseps' Apology for Her Diana Ross Costume on 'RHONY' Just Doesn't Cut It\n\nInstead of Gifts, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Want You to Donate to These Charities", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180412072213im_/https://www.glamour.com/static/images/conde-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180412072213im_/https://media.glamour.com/photos/5acb976fc132ac18221445bc/master/pass/social%20(1).jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180412072213im_/https://media.glamour.com/photos/5acb97640f4b9815aeae0dbd/master/w_644,c_limit/lede%2520(3).jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180412072213im_/https://covers.conde.io/images_covers/cover_glamour_105.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180412072213im_/https://media.glamour.com/photos/5acb976fc132ac18221445bc/master/pass/social%20(1).jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa", "Zoe Weiner", "Julyssa Lopez", "Avery Matera", "Helena Yeung", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180412072213/https://www.glamour.com/story/bethenny-frankel-once-dated-meghan-markle-ex-husband", "title": "Bethenny Frankel Says She Once Went on a Date With Meghan Markle's Ex-Husband", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-config": "/static/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "author": "Abby Gardner", "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 Cond\u00e9 Nast 2018", "description": "Real Housewives of New York's Bethenny Frankel told an Australian show that she once went on a date with Meghan Markle's ex-husband, Trevor Engelson.", "keywords": "Meghan Markle,Bethenny Frankel,Real Housewives of New York", "application-name": "Glamour Magazine", "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "og": {"site_name": "Glamour", "title": "There's a Royal Wedding and 'Real Housewives' Connection We Never Saw Coming", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180412072213/https://www.glamour.com/story/bethenny-frankel-once-dated-meghan-markle-ex-husband", "description": "Of course, Bethenny Frankel is involved.", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180412072213im_/https://media.glamour.com/photos/5acb976fc132ac18221445bc/master/pass/social%20(1).jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "glamourmag", "title": "There's a Royal Wedding and 'Real Housewives' Connection We Never Saw Coming", "description": "Of course, Bethenny Frankel is involved.", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5acb976fc132ac18221445bc/master/pass/social%20(1).jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "domain": "www.glamour.com"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
