For one, the actors are older, and age can slow even the seemingly indestructible Jackie Chan. For another, Chris Tucker became a born-again Christian and that impacted his career choices in a major way.\n\nIn a recent interview with an L.A. radio station, however, action superstar Chan revealed Rush Hour 4 is basically a go. Only one potential obstacle remains.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

It notes an appearance Tucker made on The View in which he said he and Chan \"were talking about some stuff [for Rush Hour 4] so we\u2019re thinking about doing something like that.\"\n\nWe'll keep our fingers crossed that Tucker is still as open to the idea as he seemed in July.\n\nIn the meantime, anyone who wants a dose of Jackie Chan-style action can check out The Foreigner, his new\u2014and serious\u2014action film. It hits US theaters on October 13.\n\nh/t EW", "images": ["https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY1NDA2ODUxNzE2ODgzOTIy/curtiss-zeus-radial-v8-promo.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY1NDExMjYyNjQ4Mjk2OTg1/gizele-oliveira-promo.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY1NDI2NTg5Nzc2MDI5MTM4/mongoose-x-stranger-things-promo.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY1NDI1MzUzODk5MTI0MTc4/facebook-linked_image___the-shining-deepfake-jim-carrey-e1562852823682-2.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY1NDA4MzM0ODIyNzc4MzIy/blink-of-an-eye-trailer-promo-nascar.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/t_share/MTU5MTkzMTIyODEzNzgxODgx/publisher-logo-asset.svg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY1NDI4MTg3NTAzNzk3Nzg1/2019-roush-f-150-nitemare-promo.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY1NDI4MTc5NzE5MTY5NDkw/facebook-linked_image___pg_image1.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTQ5NjExODk0NDY5MTA5MjEy/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-promo.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTUxNDIzMzQ5MDAyNjA5OTE5/section_header_art_xtrasmall_recent.svg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/t_share/MTUwNDg4NTQ2OTU0NzE2ODQz/rush-hour-promo-new-line.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY1NDA1NTQzMzYyNDcxNDQ5/rob-gronkowski-promo.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTUxNzQ3NDIxNDY0OTYyMTc0/navbar.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.maxim.com/.image/t_share/MTUwNDg4NTQ2OTU0NzE2ODQz/rush-hour-promo-new-line.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Steve Huff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/rush-hour-4-jackie-chan-chris-tucker-2017-10", "title": "Jackie Chan Confirms That 'Rush Hour 4' Is Coming, But There's One Big Catch", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "q63quMzrnwkF_yEDRGy8B69bv1FrUD6FINaZmIIlxTw", "msvalidate.01": "565AA37CB662E60BF24DDCABEC686D8F", "generator": "Tempest - www.saymedia.com", "pinterest": "nohover", "author": "Steve Huff", "description": "There have been rumors that we'd eventually see a fourth Rush Hour, but there were obstacles.
