Kaitlyn Bristowe \u2014 AKA the super spunky Bachelorette star from of the show\u2019s 11th season \u2014 locked down her dream attire last month for her possibly televised wedding event with fianc\u00e9 Shawn Booth, and she\u2019s FINALLY dropping some hints to fans about what her outfit for the big day might look like.\n\nThough no date has been revealed, the Canadian-born TV personality has been working closely with bridal gown designer and friend, Hayley Paige, to create not one, but two bespoke looks for the ceremony and reception.\n\nIn an interview with E!, Bristowe, 32, revealed that her ceremony dress is \u201c\u2026elegant but it\u2019s also edgy,\u201d adding that we shouldn\u2019t expect anything plain or simple. \u201cIt feels so pretty and it\u2019s girlier than I thought it would be,\u201d she gushed, \u201cbut there\u2019s also an edge to it which makes me feel like, \u2018Oh, this is so me.'\u201d\n\nThe designer noted that her pal\u2019s main nuptial inspiration was the black two-piece crop top and skirt she wore to the 2016 CMAs, which designer Paige called \u201c\u2026a good foundation point for the wedding dress.\u201d \u201cIt was definitely inspired by her CMAs look,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, she was best-dressed at the CMAs.\u201d\n\nAs for the color, Paige also shared that the groom-to-be, Booth, helped pick the hue for her walk down the aisle. Awwww!\n\nWhen it comes to the reception dress, both ladies confirmed that it\u2019ll be fab for dancing, and alluded that it will most likely be covered in sequins and/or glitter: \u201cLet\u2019s just say she is not going to need a disco ball,\u201d Paige quipped.\n\nWhile both of the bride\u2019s looks will no doubt be stunning, it definitely sounds like she\u2019s veering from the traditional. As the soon-to-be Broadway star pointed out, \u201cI\u2019m definitely not the traditional type of gal. I met my fianc\u00e9 on a reality show.\u201d Touch\u00e9, Kaitlyn. Touch\u00e9.\n\nWould you ever wear a two-piece wedding gown?
