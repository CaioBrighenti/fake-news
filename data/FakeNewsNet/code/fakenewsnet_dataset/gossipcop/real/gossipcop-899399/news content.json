Thanks to Candace Cameron Bure, we now know that part two of season 3 arrives just in time for the holidays on December 22, and in the new trailer that just dropped, we get a look at some pretty major events that are set to unfold. (Potential spoilers ahead!)\n\nThe trailer starts out with the usual goofy family goodness we\u2019ve come to love from the Tanner family, promising more \u201chugs, original dance numbers, and cute babies with dogs\u201d in the rest of season 3. But then: record scratch! The rest of what\u2019s in store for the season will \u201cblow your mind.\u201d\n\nFirst, we see the Tanners taking off on a trip to Tokyo, presumably for Steve\u2019s wedding. Then we get a hint that SOMEONE is planning for a baby! \u201cMy oven is pre-heated and ready to easy-bake,\u201d Kimmy says to Stephanie. \u201cWe\u2019re getting pregnant!\u201d We learned in earlier episodes that Steph is unable to have kids, so our guess is that Kimmy is going to be a surrogate.\n\nWe also get a glimpse of DJ in a wedding dress after Matt is seen getting down on one knee. But it sounds like Steve isn\u2019t ready to let her go just yet. \u201cWhat if DJ really was going to pick me?\u201d he says, referring to a previous cliffhanger. \u201cThis could be our wedding!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say a LOT will be happening in the last nine episodes of season 3! Check out the full trailer below, and tune in to Netflix on December 22 to see how everything shakes out.\n\nAre you excited for the second half of season 3?
