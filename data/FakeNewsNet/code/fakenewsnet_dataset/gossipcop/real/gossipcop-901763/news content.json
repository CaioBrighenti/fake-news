Through the series of 10 historic throwback Thursday images, fans got the message: This family is serious about holiday cheer.\n\n\u201cSome photos of Christmas past. Little, middle, big,\u201d Ripa captioned the post, referring to each of her three children, Michael, 20, Lola, 16, and Joaquin, who is 14. Dad Mark Consuelos was also in the mix.\n\nMore: Kelly Ripa Is, Like, So Embarrassing on Her Anniversary With Mark Consuelos\n\nIn the images, we see loads of smiles, dazzling Christmas decor and a range of matching holiday-themed pajamas, obviously.\n\nThe real question is: Does her Lola approve? If you\u2019ve followed Ripa on social media, you may know the teen is not a fan of her mom\u2019s desire to share intimate family photos of her daughter.\n\nMore: 2 Things to Know About Kelly Ripa\u2019s Gorgeous Daughter, Lola Consuelos\n\nIn October, the mother of three shared a sweet Halloween throwback of little Lola \u2014 and as Ripa explained on The Tonight Show, this didn\u2019t go over well with the teen, who demanded her mom take the photo down immediately. Ripa agreed, but during her appearance on the nightly show, she had host Jimmy Fallon blow the image up and show it to his millions of viewers. \u201cWhy did I have these kids if not to exploit them on social media?\u201d she joked to Fallon. Moms.\n\nIn a photo Ripa shared last week, the caption read, \u201cWishing you a LIT holiday season! With love from the Consuelos gang.\u201d Ripa even added \u201c(and yes, Lola approved)\u201d to the end to stave off any questioning. Phew! As many parents know, when the kids are happy, everyone\u2019s happy.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bethany-hamilton-unstoppable-lieber-films.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gmopepgre4ulfenzsnly.jpeg?w=695&h=391&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_721076470.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_1439766605-e1562875783520.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://us72er.com/ylkikj?MXwCTgoLGEhYFEJJURZbFhINWEkrAQpEHRZEA04EH0AIWU4OHw4EFhZfRVNBURASDVgFBh4DShEUEBZbAR9ACFldXhQ", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/teckin-smart-power-strip-bgr.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/5951803ad-1.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gmopepgre4ulfenzsnly.jpeg", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/my-autism-diagnosis-at-age-38-drastically-changed-how-i-parent.png?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shutterstock_10112916ms.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.sheknows.com&path=%2Fparenting%2Farticles%2F1137537%2Fkelly-ripa-throwback-holiday-photos-instagram%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1137537", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Best-Outdoor-Speakers.jpg?quality=98&w=330#038;ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mariah-carey-49-shows-off-her-tiny-waist-in-teeny-weeny-skintight-mini-dress-ftr.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/i-believe-in-letting-my-kid-swear-annd-my-husband-hates-it.png?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/MarquitaHP1.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gmopepgre4ulfenzsnly.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marquita Harris"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1137537/kelly-ripa-throwback-holiday-photos-instagram/", "title": "Kelly Ripa\u2019s Family TBTs Will Get You in the Holiday Spirit \u2013 SheKnows", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Kelly Ripa captured the spirit of the holidays with an adorable family #TBT photo series on Instagram.", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.2", "author": "Marquita Harris", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ripa's pics with her kids are holiday throwback gold", "url": "https://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1137537/kelly-ripa-throwback-holiday-photos-instagram/", "description": "Kelly Ripa captured the spirit of the holidays with an adorable family #TBT photo series on Instagram.", "site_name": "SheKnows", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gmopepgre4ulfenzsnly.jpeg", "width": 1024, "height": 593}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-22T18:13:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-01-22T19:51:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Ripa's pics with her kids are holiday throwback gold"}, "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gmopepgre4ulfenzsnly.jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SheKnows", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/mar_har", "title": "Ripa's pics with her kids are holiday throwback gold", "description": "Kelly Ripa captured the spirit of the holidays with an adorable family #TBT photo series on Instagram."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-sk-favicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513966380.0, "source": "https://www.sheknows.com", "summary": ""}
