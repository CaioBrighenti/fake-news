The CW's non-Arrowverse superhero series enjoyed an electrifying first year, and it set up some epic confrontations for the upcoming sophomore season. Here's everything we know about Black Lightning Season 2.\n\nWhen does it premiere?\n\nThe Season 2 premiere, titled \"The Book of Consequences: Rise of the Green Light Babies,\" will air on The CW on Tuesday, October 9 at 9PM. It will be followed by a new episode on subsequent Tuesdays.\n\nWhich characters and actors are in Season 2?\n\nCress Williams will return as the titular superhero. In his civilian guise of Jefferson Pierce, he's a father of two and a high school principal, but he came out of superhero retirement in Season 1 to fight crime as Black Lightning once again. The first season ended with Jefferson escaping a near-death situation, but by the episode's conclusion he and his family had unearthed a government conspiracy and were enjoying some much-overdue public recognition.\n\nNafessa Williams returns as Jefferson's older daughter, Anissa Pierce. In Season 1, she learned she had metahuman powers like her father, and eventually became his crimefighting ally under the superhero name Thunder. She is also TV's first black lesbian superhero. China Anne McClain plays Jennifer Pierce, the younger Pierce daughter. She develops electrical powers just like her dads by the end of Season 1, and seems poised to join the family crime-fighting team, though we don't see her suited-up in the Season 2 trailer.\n\nBlack Lightning will also be aided by his oldest friend and super-suit tailor, Peter Gambi (James Rema), the mildly antagonistic but well-meaning deputy police chief Billy Henderson (Damon Gupton), and his ex-wife, Lynn Stewart (Christine Adams).\n\nThe main villain of Season 2 will be the same as before, though if anything Tobias Whale is even more dangerous than he was last season. Played once again by Marvin \"Krondon\" Jones III, Tobias leads the villainous gang the 100 that's plaguing the city of Freeland and has connections with the corrupt metahuman agency the A.S.A. When Season 1 ended, Tobias had opened a case that appeared to contain the tools he'd need to defeat his longtime foe Black Lightning once and for all. Charlbi Dean, who plays his henchwoman Syonide, has been spotted in the Season 2 trailer, same with Jordan Calloway's Painkiller, who used to be Jennifer's boyfriend Khalil before becoming a villain.\n\nSofia Vassilieva, who recently appeared on Supergirl, joins the cast as the DC Comics hero Looker. The member of the Outsiders superhero team was alluded to in Season 1, but it's unclear how, exactly, the character will be portrayed in the show.\n\nWhat happened in Season 1, again?\n\nThe trailer The CW released over this summer's San Diego Comic-Con wasn't a preview of Season 2 so much as it was a pretty tight, 5-minute recap of the first season. It's worth watching if you need to get caught up, but the tl;dr is that Black Lightning has come fully out of retirement, joined by at least one of his two superpowered children. His arch-foe Tobias Whale hasn't been defeated, and is perhaps even more of a threat now. Oh, and there are several of pods full of teenagers with metahuman powers given to them by the A.S.A. that are just waiting to be saved and/or unleashed.\n\nVideo of Black Lightning - Comic-Con 2018 Trailer\n\nWhat will happen in Season 2?\n\nThe first real trailer for Season 2 came out on September 4, and it shows Black Lightning and Thunder getting ready to kick all types of villainous butt \u2014 and Tobias, Khalil, and Syonide are ready to dish out some pain, too. Tobias, in particular, looks pretty confident in his plan, but there haven't been many details about what, exactly, he'll be up to in Season 2.\n\nIn an interview with Fandom Wire, Cress Williams teased that Season 2 would focus on Jennifer's grappling with her powers, hinting that it would not be as easy an acceptance as Anissa's. \"It's not going to be the same as season one, where um, Anissa just embraced [her powers] and was ready to fight crime,\" he said. \"I think It's going to be a little bit more of a struggle, and from what I'm told we're just going to go harder\n\nVideo of Black Lightning | Guess Who's Back Trailer | The CW\n\nWill there be a crossover with the Arrowverse?\n\nNo \u2014 well, at least, not yet, according to the folks behind Black Lightning. From the beginning, Black Lightning has stood apart from the CW's other connected superhero shows like The Flash, Arrow, Legends of Tomorrow, and Supergirl. In January of this year, co-executive producer said there would be no crossover. \"I say this with all due respect, but [the Arrowverse is] not really relevant to the show that we're doing,\" he said.\n\nStar Cress Williams dashed further cold water on hopes for a crossover in that Fandom Wire interview when he said he didn't think there would be a crossover in Season 2, noting that Black Lightning shoots in Atlanta while all the other Arrowverse shows film in Vancouver.\n\nHowever, even if a crossover doesn't happen this season, it feels like it's bound to happen eventually. As Arrow star Stephen Amell said at April's Awesome Con in Washington, D.C., \"Everyone pretends like we're not going to eventually crossover with Black Lightning but we're probably gonna crossover with Black Lightning because that's just the way that the world works.\"", "images": ["https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/ad-choices.png", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/logo.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/syfywire_blog_post/2018/09/9569910d062dfbd6caf7219e04d0d75f1feaaf64.jpg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/close--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/down--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/watch--yellow.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/hamburger--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/menu--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/search--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/syfywire.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/watch--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/loading-spinner.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/syfywire_blog_post/2018/09/9569910d062dfbd6caf7219e04d0d75f1feaaf64.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Grebey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/everything-we-know-about-black-lightning-season-2-so-far", "title": "Everything we know about Black Lightning Season 2 (so far)", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 795894437245434}, "post_type": "syfywire_article", "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "description": "They say lightning never strikes twice, but Black Lightning is coming back for Season 2 this fall.
