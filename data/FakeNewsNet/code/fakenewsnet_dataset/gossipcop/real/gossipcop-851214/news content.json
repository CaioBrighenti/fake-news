The decision could open the door for Hernandez's former team, the New England Patriots, to issue payments to his family. The former football star signed a $40 million contract extension with the team in 2012, though the Patriots denied him a signing bonus payment after he was arrested for the murder of Lloyd in 2013.\n\nIn her interview with Dr. Phil, Jenkins says that her last conversation with Hernandez, with whom she shares a 4-year-old daughter, Avielle, \"had nothing to do with suicidal thoughts.\"\n\n\"Did he kill himself so that you could collect $6.5 million?\" Dr. Phil asks Jenkins, whose answer is not disclosed.\n\nDr. Phil's two-part interview with Jenkins airs on Monday, May 15 and Tuesday May 16.\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Gary Condit Opens Up About Chandra Levy Murder Case 15 Years Later on 'Dr. Phil'", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-04/aaron_hernandez_1280_177211.jpg?itok=EdmjYlyH", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-07/gettyimages-1161760651.jpg?itok=MLRyG4zA&h=bd7808dd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/aaron_hernandez_1280_177211.jpg?itok=UdfK5OsV", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2019-05/amazon-prime-day-beauty-sales-1280.jpg?itok=FIL40h13&h=f7474839", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/aaron_hernandez_1280_177211.jpg?itok=UdfK5OsV", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217386_aaron_hernandez_fiancee_shayanna_jenkins_tearfully_opens_up_about_his_death_i_thought_it_was_a_hoax", "title": "Aaron Hernandez's Fiancee Shayanna Jenkins Tearfully Opens Up About His Death: 'I Thought It Was a Hoax'", "meta_data": {"title": "Aaron Hernandez's Fiancee Shayanna Jenkins Tearfully Opens Up About His Death: 'I Thought It Was a Hoax' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217386_aaron_hernandez_fiancee_shayanna_jenkins_tearfully_opens_up_about_his_death_i_thought_it_was_a_hoax", "title": "Aaron Hernandez's Fiancee Shayanna Jenkins Tearfully Opens Up About His Death: 'I Thought It Was a Hoax'", "description": "Jenkins breaks her silence on Hernandez's death on next week's 'Dr. Phil.'", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/aaron_hernandez_1280_177211.jpg?itok=UdfK5OsV", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jenkins breaks her silence on Hernandez's death on next week's 'Dr. Phil.'", "title": "Aaron Hernandez's Fiancee Shayanna Jenkins Tearfully Opens Up About His Death: 'I Thought It Was a Hoax'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217386_aaron_hernandez_fiancee_shayanna_jenkins_tearfully_opens_up_about_his_death_i_thought_it_was_a_hoax", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/aaron_hernandez_1280_177211.jpg?itok=UdfK5OsV"}, "description": "Jenkins breaks her silence on Hernandez's death on next week's 'Dr. Phil.'", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Dr Phil", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Celebrities, News, Dr Phil"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
