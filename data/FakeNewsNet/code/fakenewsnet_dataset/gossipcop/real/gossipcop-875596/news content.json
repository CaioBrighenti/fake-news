Jennifer Lopez and Ja Rule gave us the \u2018I\u2019m Real (Remix),\u2019 and \u2018Lady Marmalade\u2019 received an epic reimagining from Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, P!nk, Mya (and Missy Elliot) on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack. But above it all, The Ruff Ryders' first lady and Rolling Stone\u2019s newly-minted \u2018Queen of Confessional Pop\u2019 held court with the release of \u2018Let Me Blow Ya Mind,\u2019 the deftly cool, swagged-out single from Eve\u2019s sophomore album, Scorpion. An instant classic, the track peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned the pair the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Almost 20 years later, the collaboration can still blow ya mind.", "images": ["https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/64x64/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2Fd426b0eb423b42c4a18d418154a90076.1000x1000x1.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-f3CPQ6vHckedE.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17151659&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://loadus.exelator.com/load/?g=4&j=0&p=1183&page-album_ids=%5B2984%5D%2C%5B140556%5D%2C%5B309630%5D%2C%5B370291%5D%2C%5B468743%5D%2C%5B508568%5D&page-album_in_top_10=false&page-albums=Scorpion%2CHip+Hop+Basics+Vol.+4+%3A+New+School+1998-2015%2CFriends%3A+The+Ultimate+Soundtrack%2CNow+That%27s+What+I+Call+Music%21+50%2CTake+Me+Out+-+The+Album%2CMuchDance+2002&page-artist_ids=%5B458%5D%2C%5B1893%5D&page-artist_in_top_10=false&page-artists=Eve%2CGwen+Stefani&page-genre_ids=%5B1434%5D&page-genres=Rap+Genius&page-in_top_10=false&page-new_release=false&page-release_decade=2000&page-release_month=200105&page-release_year=2001&page-type=song&user_signed_in=false", "https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/220x220/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2F11f7438c93912fddb29ef7d3823828c6.300x300x1.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=201983886890479&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://images.genius.com/11f7438c93912fddb29ef7d3823828c6.300x300x1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.genius.com/11f7438c93912fddb29ef7d3823828c6.300x300x1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://genius.com/Eve-let-me-blow-ya-mind-lyrics", "title": "Eve \u2013 Let Me Blow Ya Mind Lyrics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=709482991", "y_key": "f63347d284f184b0", "og": {"site_name": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/Eve-let-me-blow-ya-mind-lyrics", "type": "music.song", "title": "Eve (Ft.\u00a0Gwen\u00a0Stefani) \u2013 Let Me Blow Ya Mind", "description": "Samples/sounds eerily similar to Dr. Dre\u2019s last track \u201cThe Message\u201d from  the 2001 album featuring Mary J Blige.
