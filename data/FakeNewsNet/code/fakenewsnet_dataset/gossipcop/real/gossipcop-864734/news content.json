I\u2019m completely speechless. It\u2019s just \u2013 yeah, I mean, I\u2019m just \u2026\u201d a visibly shaken Williams said, her voice trailing off.\n\nThe seven-times major champion then broke down in tears, stepping out into the hallway to gather herself with members of her team.\n\nWilliams returned after about five minutes to field five more questions, mostly related to her 7-6 (7), 6-4 win against Belgium\u2019s Elise Mertens amid wildly fluctuating weather on No1 Court, as the sun\u2011splashed afternoon gave way to blustery conditions and ultimately rain.\n\nThe American \u2013 at 37 the oldest woman in the draw here \u2013 was at her imperious best in the opening stages, breaking Mertens in her opening service game and dictating points with her serve. But Mertens, who was not born when Williams turned professional and only four when she won the first of her five Wimbledon singles titles, overcame those initial nerves and began challenging Williams with powerful groundstrokes into the corners and well-concealed variety.\n\nMertens blinked during the first-set tiebreak, then surrendered her early service break in the second. Rain interrupted play with the 21-year-old, who had just saved her second match point with a gorgeous backhand lob, serving at 3-5, 40-40 in the second set.\n\nAfter a 33-minute delay Williams finished the job, uncorking an overhead smash to see off Mertens after an hour and 40 minutes and booking a second-round match against China\u2019s Qiang Wang.\n\nThe American flashed her familiar smile after meeting her opponent at the net but it became clear during the press conference that her 20th appearance at the tournament she has won five times will be loaded with emotion.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prepare for everything,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI have no idea what tomorrow will bring. That\u2019s all I can say about it. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n\nPalm Beach Gardens police said witnesses told investigators that Williams ran a red light in her Toyota Sequoia SUV at around 1pm on 9 June, injuring 79-year-old Jerome Barson, who died 13 days later. Barson was riding in the passenger seat when the Hyundai Accent driven by his wife, Linda, crashed into the side of Williams\u2019s vehicle.\n\nWilliams told investigators she entered the six-lane intersection on a green light but was forced to stop midway through because of traffic ahead of her, failing to see the Barsons\u2019 car when she continued through at about 5mph.\n\nBut police concluded the driver of Williams\u2019s car \u201cis at fault for violating the right of way\u201d. Linda Barson, 68, also sustained injuries, including \u201ca cracked sternum, shattered right arm, broken wrist, hand and fingers\u201d.\n\nWilliams made her first public comments on the incident in a Facebook post on Friday night, describing herself as \u201cheartbroken\u201d.\n\nOne of only two former Wimbledon champions in the women\u2019s field, Williams has a promising draw and perhaps a renewed ambition after her inspired run to the Australian Open final in January \u2013 a remarkable feat given the incurable autoimmune disease that has hamstrung her game for most of the decade.",
