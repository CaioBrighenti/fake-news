The Shahs of Sunset alum's boyfriend, Dara, popped the question in late August, and now she's spilling all the details about their whirlwind romance.\n\nThe two started dating back in March after Lilly had to get approval from the board at her apartment building to get another parking spot for her Ferrari. Dara just so happened to be on the board. After some time passed and several email exchanges took place, they met in the lobby of their building for the first time ever despite living a floor apart. \"I did know what he looked like only because after he asked me out. I had a girlfriend that knew him and I texted her,\" the eyelash expert recalled. \"And she sent me a photo of him and her husband and I was like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm definitely going.'\"\n\nIn fact, that first meeting has even been captured on security footage. \"We'll forever have literally the exact moment we met in life,\" she said.\n\nLilly felt something for Dara, who runs a company that makes office chairs with his parents, right from the start. \"I would say the first date I felt like I dreamed him into life,\" she said. \"I would say within two or three months of dating we were inseparable. It all moved very quickly.\"\n\nPhoto courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi\n\nPhoto courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi\n\nThat brings us to the epic late-summer proposal. The engagement came as a surprise to Lilly. It all took place on the grounds of their future home in Bel-Air at a very special spot on the property. The couple will build a home from scratch on the land, but they are keeping an already-existing gazebo, which is where he asked her to marry him. \"There was chandeliers, candles, flowers, so the reason he proposed there was [because] the only part of the existing structure that will remain is that gazebo at the top of the hill,\" she said. \"The next day, unfortunately, his 36th birthday party was completely overshadowed and turned into a huge engagement party.\"\n\nAnd, yes, Lilly loves her ring. \"It's f***ing awesome. It's an oval cut gorgeous diamond,\" she said. \"I literally could not have asked for anything more. It's very antique and dainty set with pave diamonds for the band and has pave diamonds covering the basket and everything \u2014 so all you see are diamonds. I don't know exactly how big it is, but it's big enough.\"\n\nPhoto courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi\n\nIt's even more special since her future mother-in-law helped him pick it out. \"His mom is the most fashionable f***ing awesome woman I have ever met,\" she said. \"She is everything I aspire to be in life. She has the best fashion taste. She's a glam girl.\"\n\nPhoto courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi\n\nWith the engagement behind them, the couple are now planning their wedding, slated for May 2017. After initially thinking they wanted to marry in Europe, they later settled on L.A. at the Beverly Hills Hotel. \"It's very special to be able to do it at home and have everyone you love attend,\" she said.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi\n\nWhile she doesn't keep in touch with all the Shahs, she has heard from some of the crew following her happy news. \"I ran into Reza. I talk to GG and they're both just over the moon ecstatic, congratulating me,\" she said.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi\n\nSo, what made Lilly know that Dara was the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with? Well, he's not into social media. \"He is a very private person. It's so refreshing to be with somebody that doesn't care about social media, that doesn't care about celebrities [and] is just a complete opposite from a world that I came from,\" she said. \"In that world, there's so many fake people. There's so many users. You never really know people's intentions and with him you don't even have a shred of doubt because he doesn't have these things. He doesn't care about these things.\"\n\nShe also applauds \"his success and work ethic,\" adding, \"I not only found my equal. He far surpasses anything I could ever be.\"\n\nCheck out throwback photos of Lilly, below.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-120416-lilly-ghalichi-engagement-party-02.jpg?itok=y_MQ5cVV", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=8qj_CxiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-120416-lilly-ghalichi-embed-02.jpg?itok=iBpWTcQG", "https://nbcubravoprod.apps.nbcuni.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/field_season_cast_photo/2018/12/shahs_s7_2560x1440_nologo.png?itok=sUjwqJoi", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/captain-sandy.jpg?itok=qXjF-_oI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/dorit-kemsley-morgan-stewart-look-alikes_0.jpg?itok=uElmmY9J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2015/07/dish-071615-kylie-lilly.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-120416-lilly-ghalichi-embed-01.jpg?itok=nXvnle_6", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/barbara-luann-rhony.jpg?itok=lOYMeBeH", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/rhop-904-candiace-dinner-party-explosion_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=sLRmUfZw", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-120416-lilly-ghalichi-engagement-party-03.jpg?itok=cfbidJ4G", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/225/655/190710_3986181_What_You_Didn_t_See_Ashley_Jacobs_Do_at_the_.jpg?itok=6y25G9ie", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2015/12/dish-120515-lilly-ghalichi.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-120416-lilly-ghalichi-embed-03.jpg?itok=6wDs972W", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/cynthia-kenya-kandi.jpg?itok=b8xgPLPA", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/327/663/190703_3983178_Is_Craig_Conover_Really_Over_Naomie_Olindo_.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/briana-ryan-culberson-grocery-shopping.jpg?itok=QiQLmgVL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/1021/703/190709_3985566_Andy_Cohen_Reacts_to_Lisa_Vanderpump_s_Absen.jpg?itok=lNfk2wvQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/tinsley-mortimer-reality-tv.jpg?itok=K4fcZgBt", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/755/619/190627_3980046_Sonja_Morgan_on_Ramona_Singer___She_s_Very_H.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/below-deck-med-403-joao-cries-over-brooke_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/dorinda-luann-friendship.jpg?itok=_aGuNqe_", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2016/12/dish-120416-lilly-ghalichi-promote_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/large/public/dish-120416-lilly-ghalichi-engagement-party.jpg?itok=5LGDxcHC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/media-gallery-embed/public/shahs-of-sunset-season-2-lilly-photo-diary-04.jpg?itok=NUmuGVPc", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/148/263/190625_3978632_Dorit_Kemsley_on_Camille_Grammer_s_Accusatio.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2016/12/dish-120416-lilly-ghalichi-promote_0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jocelyn Vena"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/lilly-ghalichi-engagement-details-photos", "title": "Lilly Ghalichi Is Engaged: Get the Details on Her Epic Proposal and Stunning Ring", "meta_data": {"title": "Shahs of Sunset Star Lilly Ghalichi Engaged | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "A big mazel goes out to Lilly Ghalichi, who revealed exclusively to The Daily Dish that she's found love again and is engaged.
