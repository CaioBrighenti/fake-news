Rapper Yo Gotti and R&B singer Trey Songz supported as well at Wells Fargo Center on Dec. 1, 2017 in Philadelphia.\n\nA woman who recently came forward and accused R&B singer Trey Songz of assaulting her during this year's NBA All-Star Weekend was granted a temporary restraining order against the singer, according to the NY Daily News.\n\nThe alleged victim appeared in court on Tuesday (March 6), where a judge approved her restraining order request after the woman filed a report accusing Songz of striking her in the face back in February when she attended a party at his Los Angeles home. Songz allegedly became angry with the woman after watching her engage with another man. A hearing has been set for March 27.\n\n\"We took this step today to protect my client's rights to peacefully live and work, and we will continue to fully cooperate with law enforcement's investigation of this serious matter,\" said Lisa Bloom, who is representing the woman, in a statement. \"The room was filled with Mr. Songz' friends and employees. We are asking just one of them with a conscience to reach out to us and tell us what they saw. Don't be a bystander to violence against women.\"\n\nSongz has had a few legal run-ins in the past. Last August, the singer pled guilty to two misdemeanors stemming from a December concert where the singer was accused of damaging property and throwing objects off the stage after concert organizers asked the singer to end his set. Shortly after in December, Songz was also accused of attacking a fan who said the singer knocked her cell phone to the ground after requesting to take a photo.\n\nBillboard reached out to Songz's rep for comment.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nerisha Penrose"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8235599/trey-songz-assault-victim-temporary-restraining-order", "title": "Trey Songz Alleged Assault Victim Granted Temporary Restraining Order", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Trey Songz Alleged Assault Victim Granted Temporary Restraining Order", "description": "Trey Songz's alleged assault victim was granted a temporary restraining order against the singer.", "og": {"title": "Trey Songz Alleged Assault Victim Granted Temporary Restraining Order", "description": "Trey Songz's alleged assault victim was granted a temporary restraining order against the singer.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8235599/trey-songz-assault-victim-temporary-restraining-order", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8235599/trey-songz-assault-victim-temporary-restraining-order", "title": "Trey Songz Alleged Assault Victim Granted Temporary Restraining Order", "description": "Trey Songz's alleged assault victim was granted a temporary restraining order against the singer.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
