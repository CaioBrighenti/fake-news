Ron Batzdorff/NBC\n\nThe episode will follow Kate (Chrissy Metz) and her fianc\u00e9, Toby (Chris Sullivan), as they whoop it up at their respective bachelorette and bachelor parties in Las Vegas \u2014 and knowing that fun-loving duo, things are bound to get wild.\n\nBeth (Susan Kelechi Watson) shows how it's done in Sin City. Ron Batzdorff/NBC\n\nNBC released photos from the upcoming episode and it looks like everyone has a blast in Sin City \u2014 especially Randall's wife, Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson), who gets a chance to unleash her inner party girl. Check out Beth living her best life in that limo.\n\nMetz shares a hug with co-star Caitlin Thompson (Madison). Ron Batzdorff/NBC\n\nWith just three new episodes left this season, there's lots to process: In addition to grieving our beloved Jack (Milo Ventimiglia), celebrating Kate and Toby's impending nuptials, worrying about Kevin (Justin Hartley) and his sobriety, and crossing our fingers for Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth's new restoration business, we'll also see plenty more flashbacks of Jack and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) in happier times.\n\nRandall (Sterling K. Brown), Toby (Chris Sullivan) and Kevin (Justin Hartley) have a little Vegas-style fun. Ron Batzdorff/NBC\n\nOne pic from the upcoming episode shows America's favorite couple holding each other close at what looks to be an anniversary party.\n\nRebecca and Jack in happier times. Ron Batzdorff\n\nIn other words, keep the tissues close \u2014 as usual.\n\n\"This Is Us\" returns to NBC at 9 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Feb. 27, and we can't wait!", "images": ["https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_08/1320329/this-is-us-today-tease-180223_5f03a7b82b3395675dc64a2e4eadcf7d.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_08/1320329/this-is-us-today-tease-180223_5f03a7b82b3395675dc64a2e4eadcf7d.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/see-pics-kate-s-bachelorette-party-us-t123808", "title": "See pics from Kate's bachelorette party on 'This Is Us'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/see-pics-kate-s-bachelorette-party-us-t123808", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 heads to Vegas for Kate\u2019s bachelorette party \u2014 see the pics", "description": "The Pearson clan travels to Sin City to celebrate Kate and Toby's impending nuptials when the hit NBC drama returns on Feb. 27.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_08/1320329/this-is-us-today-tease-180223_5f03a7b82b3395675dc64a2e4eadcf7d.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_08/1320329/this-is-us-today-tease-180223_5f03a7b82b3395675dc64a2e4eadcf7d.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_08/1320329/this-is-us-today-tease-180223_5f03a7b82b3395675dc64a2e4eadcf7d.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 heads to Vegas for Kate\u2019s bachelorette party \u2014 see the pics", "description": "The Pearson clan travels to Sin City to celebrate Kate and Toby's impending nuptials when the hit NBC drama returns on Feb. 27.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Pearson clan travels to Sin City to celebrate Kate and Toby's impending nuptials when the hit NBC drama \"This Is Us\" returns on Feb. 27.", "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_08/1320329/this-is-us-today-tease-180223_5f03a7b82b3395675dc64a2e4eadcf7d.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519426160.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
