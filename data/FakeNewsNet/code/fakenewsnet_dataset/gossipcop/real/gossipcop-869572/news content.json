This includes a bit called Convers(at)ion Therapy, which features a non-binary guest and sees Harrison jokingly trying to \"convert\" the person she's talking to at the end of the segment. Whether Harrison is discussing transgender dating life or ways to act more straight, one thing remains the same: She's always sneakily calling out those who aren't so welcoming to transgender people.\n\nIn addition to the trans talk, Harrison has also voiced her frustration with Donald Trump's presidency through her comedy, including \"an inauguration day workout to prepare you for the Trump administration\" and \"Christmas songs for Trump's America.\"\n\nTake a look at Harrison's response to Trump's transgender military ban and some of her other transphobic/Trump-bashing videos below.\n\n\"Trump Bans Transgender People from Military, Comedian Patti Harrison Responds\"\n\n\"An Apology on behalf of ALL Trans People\"\n\n\"An Inauguration Day Workout to Prepare you for Trump's Administration\"\n\n\"How can a Trans-Person Land a Cis Lover?\"\n\n\"What does it mean to be a Trans-Trender?\"\n\n\"ALL NEW CHRISTMAS SONGS FOR TRUMP'S AMERICA\"\n\n\"Can Playing Foosball make You Cis?\"", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/politics/7881850/patti-harrison-comedian-trump-transgender-ban-transphobic-people-videos", "title": "6 Times Comedian Patti Harrison Has Poked Fun at Trump & Transphobic People", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Patti Harrison: 6 Times Comedian Has Bashed Trump & Transphobes", "description": "Take a look at Harrison's response to Trump's transgender military ban and some of her other transphobic/Trump-bashing videos here.", "og": {"title": "6 Times Comedian Patti Harrison Has Poked Fun at Trump & Transphobic People", "description": "Take a look at Harrison's response to Trump's transgender military ban and some of her other transphobic/Trump-bashing videos here.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/politics/7881850/patti-harrison-comedian-trump-transgender-ban-transphobic-people-videos", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/politics/7881850/patti-harrison-comedian-trump-transgender-ban-transphobic-people-videos", "title": "6 Times Comedian Patti Harrison Has Poked Fun at Trump & Transphobic People", "description": "Take a look at Harrison's response to Trump's transgender military ban and some of her other transphobic/Trump-bashing videos here.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
