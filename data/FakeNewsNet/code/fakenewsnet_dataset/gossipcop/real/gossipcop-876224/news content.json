I was just like, \u2018What? Why?\u2019 \u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: WATCH: The Ladies Of Fifth Harmony Open Up About Their Upcoming Performance At Sunday Night\u2019s MTV Video Music Awards\n\nThe \u201cWork From Home\u201d singers later said the VMA stunt wasn\u2019t intended to be a dig towards Cabello, but a celebration of how the four remaining members of Fifth Harmony were stronger than ever.\n\n\u201cWe get asked all the time if we\u2019re getting a fifth member and we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that hey, the four of us are Fifth Harmony,\u201d Brooke told host Lara Spencer on Good Morning America. \u201cAnd we\u2019re stronger and better than we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nBut no matter what Fifth Harmony meant by including that moment in their performance, Cabello doesn\u2019t plan on holding it against them.\n\n\u201cI have to make space for the good stuff to happen in my life,\u201d she told The New York Times. \u201cI don\u2019t like holding onto the past, especially when it\u2019s stuff that, in my opinion, is just petty.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Normani Kordei (left), Dinah Jane Hansen, Lauren Jauregui, Camila Cabello, and Ally Brooke Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat\n\nThe \u201cHavana\u201d singer also opened up for the first time about why she decided to leave the successful pop group.\n\nCabello told the Times that the trouble started after she became the first member of the group to release music outside of the band \u2014 2015\u2019s \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d with Shawn Mendes.\n\nAs tensions started building, Cabello claimed she tried to become more involved with Fifth Harmony\u2019s songwriting process, but was denied the opportunity.\n\n\u201cI was just curious and I wanted to learn and I saw all these people around me making music, writing songs and being so free,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to do that and it did not work.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Remaining Fifth Harmony Members \u2018Were Truly Hurt\u2019 by Camila Cabello\u2019s Departure After They \u2018Pleaded\u2019 She Stay for One More Album\n\nCabello also added that the tension between her and her bandmates only got worse as she began working with more producers, like Diplo and Cashmere Cat.\n\n\u201cIt became clear that it was not possible to do solo stuff and be in the group at the same time,\u201d Cabello explained, claiming that she was eventually given an ultimatum between working on solo material and staying in the band. \u201cIf anyone wants to explore their individuality, it\u2019s not right for people to tell you no.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Camila Cabello Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat\n\nCabello will drop her first solo LP \u2014 simply titled Camila \u2014on Friday, just over a year after the Dec. 19, 2016 announcement of her departure from Fifth Harmony.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/camila-cabello-2.jpg",
