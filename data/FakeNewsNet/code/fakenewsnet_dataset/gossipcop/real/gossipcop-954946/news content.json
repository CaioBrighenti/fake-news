Either way, the outcome is negative and tantamount to bullying.\u201d\n\nThe article questioned why Eugenie\u2019s nuptials are rivaling Prince Harry\u2018s wedding to Meghan Markle in May, given that Eugenie is further down in line for the throne (ninth, as opposed to Harry\u2019s sixth) and doesn\u2019t have the same widespread intrigue as the son of a future king. At one point, Moir dismisses Eugenie as \u201cconstitutionally important as one of the Queen\u2019s corgis.\u201d\n\nCouldn\u2019t agree more with this letter about the disgusting article that Jan Moir wrote about Eugenie and Jack. Bullying at its\u2019 premium and hiding behind a newspaper commenting about people you\u2019ve never met @MailOnline @RE_DailyMail @Daily_Express @Telegraph @DailyMirror pic.twitter.com/eVvzOdRx2x \u2014 lAntonia Marshall (@antoniam6) July 25, 2018\n\nImage zoom Jack Brooksbank, Princess Eugenie and Sarah Ferguson David M Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Hope and Homes for Children\n\nWade continues, \u201cThe rhetoric is inflammatory and divisive, suggesting that the Princess has a \u2018hunger for glitz and glamour that is every bit as monstrous as Mother\u2019s Fergie\u2019s\u2019 and making the ill-search judgement that the Princess has done \u2018almost nothing of note.\u2019 I would like to raise into question whether Jan Moir has ever met or spent time with Princess Eugenie or whether the source of her malicious contempt for a 28-year-old woman is the result of years of unfounded and hurtful abuse that has been directed towards the Princess and her family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we support freedom of expression, but not when the intended outcome is to inflict pain on another person or incite others to do so,\u201d Wade concludes.\n\nImage zoom Jack Brooksbank and Princess Eugenie Jonathan Brady/Pa/Getty\n\nLike Eugenie\u2019s cousin Prince Harry, the princess and Brooksbank, the 31-year-old U.K. ambassador for George Clooney\u2019s Casamigos tequila, are exchanging vows at Windsor Castle\u2019s St. George\u2019s Chapel. And they will follow it with a carriage ride (albeit much shorter) through the streets of Windsor and back into the castle. Like Harry and Meghan, the future newlyweds are also inviting 1,200 members of the public to enjoy a close-up view of the second royal wedding of the year.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Princess Eugenie Shows Off Sapphire Engagement Ring (with Major Kate Vibes!) in New Portraits\n\nAlthough \u201cit is very much Princess Eugenie and Jack\u2019s day, and they are leading the planning,\u201d a palace source says, they are also getting plenty of input from the mother of the bride. \u201cFergie is very involved,\u201d a well-placed insider tells PEOPLE in this week\u2019s issue.\n\nImage zoom Sarah Ferguson and Princess Eugenie Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

But this one has the added input of palace staffers, working on behalf of Eugenie\u2019s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, who considers Windsor Castle her favorite official residence.", "images":
