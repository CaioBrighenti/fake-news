{"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-oceans-trilogy-february/", "text": "With the all-ladies Ocean\u2019s 8 coming this summer, I find that lately all I want to do is watch Ocean\u2019s Eleven, Ocean\u2019s Twelve (yes, I do enjoy Ocean\u2019s Twelve, let me live), and Ocean\u2019s Thirteen. This is a simple enough desire, right? But unfortunately, for some reason, they are never all streaming at the same time. It\u2019s like, one month Ocean\u2019s Eleven will be here, and then Ocean\u2019s Thirteen ends up on another streaming platform, and everyone has just agreed to forget about Ocean\u2019s Twelve (except me), so that\u2019s nowhere. It\u2019s driving me mad. Can\u2019t a girl get her Danny Ocean caper fix when she wants it??\n\nWell, thankfully, someone has been looking at my vision board, and in February all three Ocean\u2019s movies are coming to Netflix. Yes, along with binging (and re-binging) your favorite shows, you\u2019ll be able to binge-watch Danny Ocean steal SO MUCH STUFF, thanks to Netflix. Would it be weird to throw an actual Ocean\u2019s trilogy party? Does that sound like the best night ever, or is it just me? Would you show up to that? (You don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to.)\n\nOcean\u2019s Eleven, Ocean\u2019s Twelve, and Ocean\u2019s Thirteen all land on Netflix on February 1st, so mark your calendars. That gives you plenty of time to watch all three movies *at least* a dozen times before Ocean\u2019s 8 lands in theaters on June 8th, 2018 (nice work there with the multiple 8s).\n\nThese three titles are just a handful of the dozens of new shows, movies, and specials that will land on Netflix next month. We\u2019ll have the full list on Tuesday, so be sure and check back here then to make sure you can start planning your viewing schedule for the month. Or start planning your own Ocean\u2019s party. You do you.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/01/18141156/spice-girls-e1547849528399.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/12210649/ChristmasSwitch.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/16020752/avatar-b1-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/13081306/Chris-Hemsworth-Avengers.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/23070040/legally-blonde.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09090444/Halle-Bailey-Original-Ariel.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/04101257/Chloe-x-Halle-Bailey.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/14095406/Rupert-Grint-and-Tom-Felton-Harry-Potter.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/08080643/Halle-Bailey-Ariel.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/01/22120256/taylor-swift-cats.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/03161937/friends-e1543882785629.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/27112306/picture-of-harry-meghan-lifetime-movie-photo.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/11074641/frozen-ii-trailer-e1560264419505.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/11095749/book-smart.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/27071206/Cinderella-e1551280475333.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/10090702/Rebel-Wilson-and-Anne-Hathaway-e1557504461234.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/21140751/oceans.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22121101/aoc-knock-down-the-house.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/18071559/Sophie-Turner.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/23095720/Ariana-Grande-e1556038674146.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/01/25083926/cat-doc-netflix.png"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/21140751/oceans.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paige"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-oceans-trilogy-february/", "title": "The \"Ocean's Eleven\" trilogy is coming to Netflix, and my prayers have finally been answered", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Danny Ocean,netflix,ocean's 8,Ocean's Eleven,Ocean's Thirteen,Ocean's Twelve,Movies", "news_keywords": "Ocean's Eleven, Ocean's Twelve, Ocean's Thirteen, Ocean's 11, Ocean's 12, Ocean's 13, Netflix, Danny Ocean, George Clooney", "description": "If you've been looking for a place to watch all the \"Ocean's\" movies, Netflix has you covered \u2014 Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen will soon be streaming.", "og": {"title": "The \"Ocean's Eleven\" trilogy is coming to Netflix, and my prayers have finally been answered", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-oceans-trilogy-february/", "description": "Make the call.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/21140751/oceans.jpg", "width": 574, "height": 1362}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-oceans-trilogy-february/", "description": "If you've been looking for a place to watch all the \"Ocean's\" movies, Netflix has you covered \u2014 Ocean's Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen will soon be streaming.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/21140751/oceans.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-oceans-trilogy-february/", "title": "The \"Ocean's Eleven\" trilogy is coming to Netflix, and my prayers have finally been answered", "description": "Make the call.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/01/21140751/oceans.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
