I truly loved him & what he stood for. \u2014 Lucy Hale (@lucyhale) June 8, 2018\n\nHis wisdom, his insight, his humor, his compassion, his staunch resistance to the inauthentic and support of all that resonates from the heart, and his passion for life that he shared with the us....Its difficult to process a world without Anthony Bourdain. \u2014 Elijah Wood (@elijahwood) June 8, 2018\n\nTrump says news of Anthony Bourdain's death shocked him this morning: \"I want to extend to his family my heartfelt condolences...I enjoyed his show, he was quite a character.
