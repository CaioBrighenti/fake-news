News , the cast of Hamilton was in for a major surprise when the royal couple showed up at the Broadway hit musical at London's West End Theatre on Friday night.\n\nCast member Leslie Garcia Bowman shared her excitement to see the married couple on Twitter, writing \"Was an honour to have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in to watch @HamiltonWestEnd last night.\u201d\n\nIronically, parts of the award-winning musical make fun of Harry's ancestor King George III while telling the story of the founding of the United States (perfect for the American and British duo!)\n\nThe Director of West End also confirmed that the couple seemed to thoroughly enjoy their private visit.\n\nThanks to some new royal arrangements, the couple can now take time to enjoy dates like this. Earlier today, Kensington Palace revealed that former press officer Amy Pickerill was appointed the position of assistant private secretary in Prince Harry's office and will be working on Markle\u2019s right hand woman and aide, handling all of her correspondences. A spokesman from Kensington Palace said the assistant \"will be working on Meghan Markle's programme.\" (Because a maid of honor alone is not going to cut it for this wedding.)\n\nSee more: Will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Spend the Night Before Their Royal Wedding Together?\n\nThe two have been wedding planning in the midst of their chaotic schedule, attending public engagements together and preparing for Markle's big transition into royalty.
