The publicist has reportedly gotten over their televised ordeal, even ripping up his paper heart in the first teaser for the show, and now, she\u2019s ready to meet her bachelors \u2014 and so are we! Luckily, ABC has given us a sneak peek at their limo arrivals with a brand-new trailer \u2014 and let\u2019s just say, these guys are pulling out all the stops.\n\nIf you\u2019ll recall, one of her early suitors rode in on a horse for a surprise meet and greet during The Bachelor season finale. Now, one of the brunette beauty\u2019s 28 contestants is taking things up a notch, riding in on a bull. Yes, a bull. (Because limos are SO 2017.)\n\nWhen the limo finally does arrive, she\u2019s greeted by none other than Arie Luyendyk Jr. himself \u2014 er, rather, a cardboard cutout of him. Another of her would-be love interests brought the prop along for their very first encounter. Yikes!\n\nIt's time to bring on the men! They better not chicken out. \ud83d\udc25 #TheBachelorette pic.twitter.com/QJFMEmunBe \u2014 The Bachelorette (@BacheloretteABC) May 12, 2018\n\nPerhaps most surprising of all, however, is the guy who appears in full chicken costume, complete with yellow fur, a giant beak, and red comb on his head. Flapping his wings and making chicken sounds, he goes for the ultimate dad joke, turning his clucking sounds from \u201cBa-caw!\u201d to \u201cBecca!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is happening?!\u201d our Bachelorette asks in disbelief. We don\u2019t even know, Becca. We don\u2019t even know. Looks like this one\u2019s gonna be a doozy\u2026\n\nAre you excited to watch Becca on The Bachelorette?
