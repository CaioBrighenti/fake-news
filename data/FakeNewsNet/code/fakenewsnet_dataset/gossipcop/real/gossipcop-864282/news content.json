The remix was released as a single by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Columbia Records, and Parkwood Entertainment. Beyonc\u00e9 donated all proceeds from the song to hurricane relief charities in Mexico, Puerto Rico, and other Caribbean islands. Balvin and William stated Beyonc\u00e9 was the \"top choice\" for the remix, and had no expectation of her agreeing to the song when they reached out to her.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 would later perform the song in her set in Coachella in 2018. For the second weekend, Balvin joined her on stage.\n\nThis song is also part of the set list for the OTR II tour. The song was added to the set list at the show in Manchester on June 13, 2018 at Etihad Stadium.\n\nCommercial performance [ edit ]\n\nUpon the release of the remixed version of the song featuring Beyonc\u00e9, the song reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart, ending the 35-week reign led by \"Despacito\", becoming Balvin's fourth number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart, as well as Beyonc\u00e9's highest-charting song on the chart after \"Irreplaceable\" peaked at number four and \"Beautiful Liar\" peaked at number 10 in 2007. On the Hot 100, the remix moved from number 21 to number three after a full tracking week, giving both Balvin and William their first top 10 single and Beyonc\u00e9 her 17th top 10 single (27th with Destiny's Child) on the chart. The remix also reached number one the US Digital Songs chart with 79,000 copies sold during that week (combined sales with the original version), becoming both Balvin and William's first number one song on that respective chart, and Beyonc\u00e9's sixth, as well as just the second mostly-Spanish sung song to top the chart after \"Despacito\".[122] This made \"Mi Gente\", alongside \"Despacito\", as the first time in the Hot 100 chart history for two non-English singles to appear in the top 10 simultaneously.\n\nIn Canada, the remix reached a new peak of number two on the Canadian Hot 100, behind Post Malone and 21 Savage's \"Rockstar\", becoming both Balvin and William's highest charting single at the time, and Beyonc\u00e9's 13th top 10 single. It also moved from number 17 to number one on the Hot Digital Songs chart.[123]\n\nThe remix also peaked at number one in many European and Latin American countries, including Argentina, Hungary, Mexico, the Netherlands, Bolivia, Costa Rica, and Australia.\n\nMusic video [ edit ]\n\nA music video was also released on YouTube featuring American producer Diplo, French DJ David Guetta, Dutch DJ Martin Garrix, Dutch DJ Ti\u00ebsto, Venezuelan YouTuber Lele Pons, Brazilian soccer player Neymar, Brazilian singer Anitta, Colombian singer El Llane, Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and several fan made videos.[124]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nThe version featuring Beyonc\u00e9 was named \"Best New Track\" by Pitchfork with Matthew Ismael Ruiz stating that the song \"is about a shared cultural pride, one that transcends borders and race, from J Balvin's native Colombia to Puerto Rico and across all of Latinidad. It's a declaration that \"El mundo nos quiere\" (The world wants us) set to a head-nod bop. Beyonc\u00e9 gets this, and with this remix, she backs up her words with action. This is what solidarity sounds like.\"[125] Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times wrote that: \"To say Beyonc\u00e9 lends a hand in the remix is an understatement. Unlike guests who limit their contributions to a single late-track verse or hook, Beyonc\u00e9 upends \"Mi Gente\" from the first verse and proceeds to bilingually maneuver through the rhythmic, up-tempo jam like the queen she is.\"[126]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nTrack listing [ edit ]\n\nDigital download[121] No. Title Length 1. \"Mi Gente\" (featuring Beyonc\u00e9 3:29\n\nCharts [ edit ]\n\nCertifications [ edit ]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/Sales Australia (ARIA)[162] Platinum 70,000^ United States (RIAA)[163] 68\u00d7 Platinum (Latin) 4,080,000 Spain (PROMUSICAE)[164] Gold 20,000* *sales figures based on certification alone\n\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\n\nsales+streaming figures based on certification alone\n\nRelease history [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/J_Balvin_Mi_Gente.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Double-dagger-14-plain.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Mi-gente-beyonce.jpg/220px-Mi-gente-beyonce.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/J_Balvin_Mi_Gente.jpg/220px-J_Balvin_Mi_Gente.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/J_Balvin_Mi_Gente.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi_Gente_(J_Balvin_and_Willy_William_song)", "title": "Mi Gente (J Balvin and Willy William song)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.34.0-wmf.13", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/J_Balvin_Mi_Gente.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
