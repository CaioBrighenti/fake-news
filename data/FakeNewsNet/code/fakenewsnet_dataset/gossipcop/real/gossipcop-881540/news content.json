The film stars Donald Glover, Beyonce, James Earle Jones and many more, and it was revealed on Instagram that Chance The Rapper is also featured in the CGI-edition of the Disney classic.\n\nIn a social media post after attending the world premiere of the movie, Lil Chano wrote that he was a part of the film\u2019s consulting process, which was a dream come true.\n\n\u201cI grew up my whole life obsessed with all things related to #TheLionKing,\u201d he wrote. \"Needless to say the original film was immensely impactful on my music and overall life.

I grew up my whole life obsessed with all things related to #TheLionKing; like all three films, the Timon and Pumbaa tv show, the broadway play and especially the broadway soundtrack. Needless to say the original film was immensely impactful on my music and overall life. So when my big bro Donald got casted as Simba, he did the coolest thing ever and told director Jon Favreau to call me in as a consultant to keep the original flavor. So for about a year I would go to the LK studio and see early animations, scenes, music direction or assemblies and they\u2019d always be out of this world amazing. One day I\u2019m there Jon asked me to do some singing stuff, another day he asks me to do some lines. Its all a blur, but I\u2019ll tell u its one of the best blurs of my whole life. I am so blessed to know people like Donald and Jon man. AMAZING FILM, AMAZING CAST AND AN AMAZING NIGGHT LAST NIGHT. GOD BLESS AND LONG LIVE THE KING\n\nA post shared by Chance The Rapper Owbum (@chancetherapper) on Jul 10, 2019 at 8:17am PDT", "images": ["https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/chance-the-rapper-the-lion-king-1562787953-650x366.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/spinderella-suing-salt-n-pepa-1562856595-240x135.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/euphoria-renewed-season-2-1562945204-650x366.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2017/09/Big-Sean-Carpool-Karaoke-1505920599-compressed.png", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/lil-kim-blasts-media-1562792338-240x135.jpg", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/cardib-jennifer-lopez-hustlers-film-1553025230-768x768-1562858258-240x135.jpg", "https://www.vibe.com/assets/images/logo/white.svg?edb4fa5dcea44378cb64", "https://static.vibe.com/files/2019/07/GettyImages-1160402526-2-1562776630-300x169.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://static.vibe.com/files/2017/09/Big-Sean-Carpool-Karaoke-1505920599-compressed.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desire Thompson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vibe.com/2017/09/tracee-ellis-ross-raps-big-sean-carpool-karaoke", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Raps With Big Sean On 'Carpool Karaoke'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2017-09-20T13:05:45-04:00", "published_time": "2017-09-20T12:00:28-04:00"}, "description": "\"It's past time that y'all knew, I'm not the lady from 'The Chew'\"", "og": {"description": "\"It's past time that y'all knew, I'm not the lady from 'The Chew'\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.vibe.com/files/2017/09/Big-Sean-Carpool-Karaoke-1505920599-compressed.png", "height": 350, "width": 640}, "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Raps With Big Sean On 'Carpool Karaoke'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vibe.com/2017/09/tracee-ellis-ross-raps-big-sean-carpool-karaoke", "site_name": "Vibe"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "\"It's past time that y'all knew, I'm not the lady from 'The Chew'\"", "image": "https://static.vibe.com/files/2017/09/Big-Sean-Carpool-Karaoke-1505920599-compressed.png", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross, AKA T-Murda, Spits Hot Fire With Big Sean On 'Carpool Karaoke'", "site": "@vibemagazine"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505923228.0, "source": "https://www.vibe.com", "summary": ""}
