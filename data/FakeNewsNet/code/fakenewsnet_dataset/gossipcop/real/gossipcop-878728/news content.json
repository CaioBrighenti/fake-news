They took that literally: The cover features the lifestyle site\u2019s founder and CEO, Gwyneth Paltrow, topless and slathered in mud from head to toe.\n\nThe 96-page magazine debut, which retails for a hefty price (like all things Goop) of $15, is the first iteration of a new quarterly publication. Just like the online brand, the book will feature wellness advice, clean beauty secrets, healthy recipes and more.\n\nThe Fall 2017 issue, specifically, covers a makeup-bag detox, deep-dives into crystals and mud masks, a do-anywhere workout from fitness guru Tracy Anderson, fall fashion, tips for a better orgasm and a candid conversation with Paltrow, 44, herself.\n\nIn one standout story, the actress talks about having bee venom injected into her C-section scar. \u201cThe doctor stings you [with a live bee] like it\u2019s an acupuncture needle,\u201d shared the mother of Apple, 13, and Moses, 11 (with ex Chris Martin). \u201cI had it done on my cesarean scar\u2026 I had some buckling in the scar, and it really evened it out.\u201d\n\nIn the issue\u2019s editor letter, Paltrow also recalls her first-ever cleanse: \u201cI remember standing in a hippie health-food store in Greenwich Village and I saw a little paperback book describing a \u2018master cleanse,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 I remember the next day [after I finished the cleanse] I was like, \u2018Oh, wow, I just did this cleanse, and I feel so much better. I can have a beer and a cigarette now, right?'\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?
