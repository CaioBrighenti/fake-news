The musician and actress has been revealed as the host for the 2017 WE Day, the annual one-day California event that brings together thousands of young people in promotion of youth advocacy for social issues.\n\n\u201cMy first WE Day experience was three years ago and to say I was impressed is an understatement,\u201d Gomez, 24, said in a statement. She was one of the performers at last year\u2019s event. \u201cThe electricity of an arena full of thousands of young people who are making real change in the world is like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced. I am grateful to be a part of such a supportive community and hope I can inspire the kids at WE Day just as they continue to inspire me.\u201c\n\nShe will be joined by Alicia Keys, who will perform. Other VIP appearances are expected to include Demi Lovato, Bryan Cranston, Lily Collins, Magic Johnson, DJ Khaled, Miss Piggy and Alessia Cara. Lovato was also in attendance last year, as were Charlize Theron and Joe Jonas.\n\nGomez has been making a calculated return to the spotlight since releasing her \u201ccomeback\u201d record, \u201cRevival,\u201d in October 2015. She scored her first Vogue cover for the April 2017 issue, and has been promoting the Netflix series she produced, \u201c13 Reasons Why.\u201d\n\nWE Day, according to its founder Craig Kielburger, \u201ccelebrates the amazing young people who have taken action at home and around the world, to create sustainable change for a better tomorrow. Standing in a stadium full of passionate youth will affirm your belief that real change can happen \u2014 and is happening every single day right here in California. This past school year more than 875 California schools in the WE Schools program made an incredible impact in their own backyards and in communities around the world through their commitment and passion for change.\u201d", "images":
