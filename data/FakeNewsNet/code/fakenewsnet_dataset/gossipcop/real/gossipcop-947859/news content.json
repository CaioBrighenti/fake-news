Kylie Jenner isn\u2019t going to let the first year of 4-month-old daughter Stormi pass her by without planning for the best 1st birthday bash Calabasas has ever seen.\n\nThe 20-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star revealed her plans for the celebration \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with followers in a series of Snapchat videos on Wednesday, June 27.\n\n\u201cStormi is gonna be 5 months this weekend, which really is tripping me,\u201d she began the first Snap. \u201cThat means we\u2019re halfway to a year \u2014 almost \u2014 and I\u2019m already thinking about her first birthday and how it\u2019s going to be epic, OK?\u201d\n\nShe continued to reveal that she had already decided on a theme, but sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian used it for their daughters\u2019 joint birthday parties earlier in June. \u201cI was going to do super magical unicorn theme, but North and Penelope beat me to it, so I have to think of something else.\u201d\n\nJenner welcomed her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott on February 1. The lip-kit maven kept her pregnancy news under wraps until the birth announcement post on social media three days after the baby\u2019s arrival.\n\n\u201cI understand you\u2019re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. my pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world,\u201d the reality star wrote at the time. \u201cI knew for myself i needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way i knew how. there was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal i had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\u201d\n\nThe Life of Kylie star wasn\u2019t shy about sharing sweet pics and videos of the baby girl until earlier this month, when she revealed that she\u2019s not sharing photos of her little one \u201cright now\u201d after a followers accused her of cutting Stormi out of a selfie.\n\n\u201cYeah I cut my baby out. I\u2019m not sharing photos of my girl right now,\u201d Jenner responded. She also went a step further and deleted all of the previously shared photos.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rails-Top-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1097470430-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Leggings-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kylie-jenner3.jpg?crop=0px%2C171px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kylie-jenner3.jpg?crop=0px%2C198px%2C2000px%2C1130px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kylie-jenner3.jpg?crop=0px%2C171px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kylie-jenner-is-already-planning-stormis-epic-first-b-day-party/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Is Already Planning Stormi's 'Epic' First B-Day Party", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kylie Jenner revealed that she's already planning for 4-month-old daughter Stormi's 'epic' first birthday party in a series of Snapchat videos on Wednesday, June 27 \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Huh?
