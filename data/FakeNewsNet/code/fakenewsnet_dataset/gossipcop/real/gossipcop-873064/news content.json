Most lip balms are used to soothe and protect dry lips. Tinted balms enhance your natural lip color along with moisturizing.\n\nMany times lip balms contain unsavory ingredients such as petroleum.\n\nIf you are looking for a natural lip balm I suggest the Afterglow Cosmetics Organic Infused Lip Soother in Hush (my favorite because it has a Lavender aroma). To add some color you can pair an Organic Infused Hydra Gloss on top. Fortune is a gorgeous choice for the fall.", "images": ["https://qsf.fs.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favicon.ico-26-ae77b637b1e7ed2c.ico", "https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-thumb-203659671-100-dcmxuhxlxdbpdesotugfyglhwxkxmnpr.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://qsf.fs.quoracdn.net/-3-images.favicon.ico-26-ae77b637b1e7ed2c.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.quora.com/Would-you-consider-a-colored-lip-balm-as-a-makeup-product", "title": "Would you consider a colored lip balm as a makeup product?", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.quora.com", "summary": ""}
