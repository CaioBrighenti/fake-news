(Paul Hebert/ABC)\n\nIt has not been a great week for Arie Luyendyk Jr. The 36-year-old race-car-driver-turned-real-estate-agent faced immense backlash after his turn as ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d when he proposed to Becca Kufrin, a 27-year-old publicist from Minnesota, and then blindsided her with a breakup so he could propose to the runner-up, Lauren Burnham, a 25-year-old salesperson from Virginia.\n\nSo, as is tradition, the final \u201cBachelor\u201d couple has to embark on ABC talk show appearances after the finale \u2014 and for Arie, it has naturally turned pretty defensive. By Thursday, even Becca \u2014 just named the newest Bachelorette \u2014 was halfheartedly defending him during an interview with \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had to do what he had to do. And I don\u2019t fault him for that,\u201d Becca said, in response to whether she felt \u201cambushed\u201d by the breakup. \u201cI would want him to follow his heart and not to feel trapped in a relationship with me. At the end of the day, if it had to happen, then it had to happen.\u201d\n\nHere are three takeaways from Arie\u2019s press tour:\n\n[A legislator has a bill to ban \u2018The Bachelor\u2019s\u2019 Arie Luyendyk Jr. from Minnesota]\n\nArie has multiple explanations for breaking up with Becca on camera.\n\nViewers were stunned on Monday night upon seeing the footage of Becca, who thought she was arriving at a house in Los Angeles to spend a romantic weekend with Arie. Instead, he had brought along a camera crew to film as he called off their engagement because he was still in love with Lauren.\n\nArie was roasted on social media for this decision \u2014 while the producers probably encouraged it, they swear the cameras were Arie\u2019s choice \u2014 and some of our country\u2019s top TV personalities were equally confused.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of backlash from a lot of people,\u201d Michael Strahan said Wednesday on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d reading tweets from former \u201cBachelor\u201d contestants who thought the show went too far. \u201cWhy was the decision made to film this? It probably could have been done \u2014 I think a lot of people felt \u2014 in a more quiet way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really wanted everyone to know that this was on me, this was my fault. And I felt like filming that would let people know that. That if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup,\u201d Arie explained. \u201cAnd I wanted her that opportunity \u2014 honestly, I wanted her the opportunity to be the potential Bachelorette.\u201d\n\nThat reasoning was similar to Arie\u2019s thinking that he shared during the finale, about how he wanted to be fully transparent. But essentially saying he was doing a good thing because he knew it would help Becca be named the Bachelorette? Apparently, he thinks he did her a favor.\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s \u201cLive with Kelly and Ryan,\u201d Kelly Ripa called Arie \u201cshady\u201d and said the choice to air the extended breakup was \u201cexcessively cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy break up with Becca like you did on camera and why 40 minutes of us seeing her in so much pain?\u201d Ryan Seacrest asked.\n\nArie emphasized that although he wanted to film the breakup, he didn\u2019t decide to air the whole thing \u2014 that was the producers\u2019 call.\n\n\u201cThrough every breakup there\u2019s always questions of what went wrong. And I knew if we did it on camera that I could take ownership of it and that it was completely my fault and my doing. I thought that was important,\u201d Arie said, echoing his earlier answer. \u201cAnd the whole thing started on camera, and I wanted the story to be told all the way to the end.\u201d\n\nAh, so he also wanted to do it for continuity\u2019s sake. Good to know.\n\nArie wants everyone to know he\u2019s fine with the backlash.\n\nSocial media users have not been kind. \u201cAre you worried about how people are going to react to your relationship with Lauren?\u201d Michael Strahan asked on \u201cGMA.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that, you know, you\u2019d love to have the support from people online, but what really matters is our relationship, our family, our friends, and they\u2019re all on board,\u201d Arie said.\n\nLauren repeated this idea when she joined Arie later in the interview, and Strahan asked again about how they\u2019re handling the haters.\n\n\u201cIf either of us is struggling, we come to each other and try to make light of any kind of hate we get. Just kind of joke around,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think we try to turn it around and try to poke fun at things. Some things are kind of funny,\u201d Arie said, noting that he and Lauren \u201cdidn\u2019t get the best edit\u201d on the show. \u201cAs long as we have each other, we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n\nArie and Lauren have already started planning the wedding.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what they told Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night. Kimmel was shocked when he asked them a question about whether Arie changes his mind a lot when he\u2019s out at dinner, and Lauren responded that they\u2019ve never actually been to dinner before.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been to a restaurant together? Oh, you should definitely get married right away,\u201d Kimmel deadpanned.\n\nArie and Lauren also cuddled through every interview, with lots of public displays of affection. They told Ripa and Seacrest that they\u2019re headed out of the country on vacation, and when they get back, they\u2019re going to pack up Lauren\u2019s belongings in Virginia and drive to Phoenix, where they\u2019ll live together. In other words, this disastrous situation was worth it, because they\u2019re soul mates.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s difficult for a lot of people to swallow, but I\u2019m happy. And it took a long, hard road to get here,\u201d Arie said. \u201cBut I\u2019m really solid in my relationship, and we have been together since January and it\u2019s going really well. And I knew this was going to be a tough week for me.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThis \u2018Bachelor\u2019 expert says watching the show has made her a smarter dater\n\nThe worst moments from an awkward \u2018Bachelor\u2019 finale that just kept going\n\n\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 tries to do damage control after disastrous finale, but only makes things worse", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JL4jdyGdq0peOfYeXoa3wRmtd4A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RBR4LTORGAYIBOWLHXIDATOZOI.jpg", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JL4jdyGdq0peOfYeXoa3wRmtd4A=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RBR4LTORGAYIBOWLHXIDATOZOI.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture", "March", "Emily Yahr Is An Entertainment Reporter For The Washington Post.
