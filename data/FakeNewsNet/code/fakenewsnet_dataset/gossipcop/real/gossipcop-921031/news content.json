This is so amazing!!!\u201d mom Kris Jenner wrote on Instagram after the video was released.\n\nRELATED: Video Vixens! Watch Every Single Kardashian/Jenner Music Video Cameo\n\nAt the start of the video, Lil Dicky, 30, and Brown, 28 \u2014 who\u2019s been making headlines this week after a recent Snapchat ad made light of Brown\u2019s conviction for assaulting his ex-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009 \u2014 swap bodies much to the rapper\u2019s delight.\n\n\u201cSometimes I really wish I could be somebody else,\u201d laments Lil Dicky in a Chinese restaurant as he watches Brown \u2014 who also says he wishes he could \u201ckind of, like, be somebody else for a day\u201d \u2014 on the TV.\n\nAfter swapping bodies, Brown (as Lil Dicky) then romps with models, drives a Ferrari and even has a FaceTime session with Kanye West. Meanwhile, Lil Dicky (as Brown) enjoys a more low-key life and even makes a reference to the singer\u2019s embattled public image.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking down the street and nobody know my name / Ain\u2019t no paparazzi flashing pictures this is great / Ain\u2019t nobody judge me \u2019cause I\u2019m black or my controversial past.\u201d\n\nSnapchat apologized earlier this week for running an ad for a game called \u201cWould You Rather\u201d and asking its users if they would rather slap Rihanna or punch Brown.\n\nOn Thursday, the \u201cWork\u201d singer slammed the social media app on Instagram, writing \u201cNow SNAPCHAT I know you already know you ain\u2019t my fav app out there! But I\u2019m just trying to figure out what the point was with this mess! I\u2019d love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain\u2019t that dumb!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Rihanna on Instagram Stories Rihanna/Instagram\n\n\u201cYou spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV victims and made a joke of it!!! \u2026 Shame on you. Throw the whole app-oligy away,\u201d she added about the ad, which was pulled from the app on Tuesday.\n\nBrown\u2019s lawyer also released a statement to PEOPLE, saying \u201cwhoever conceived this at Snapchat needs to be slapped.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dwayne-wade-lil-nas-x.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630",
