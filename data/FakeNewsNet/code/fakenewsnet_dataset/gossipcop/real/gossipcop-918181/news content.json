But when Tiffany Haddish said she wanted to get her money's worth out of the Alexander McQueen dress she bought for the premiere of Girl's Trip back when she hosted the show in November 2017, she really wasn\u2019t kidding. Not only did she wear it to deliver her SNL monologue, but she brought it out again to present at the 2018 Oscars.\n\nAs Haddish explained on SNL (where she made history as the first black female comedian to ever host the show, by the way), the $4,000 gown, which she wore to the Girl's Trip red carpet in July 2017, cost more than her mortgage\u2014it\u2019s only right that she re-wear it for special occasions.\n\nSATURDAY NIGHT LIVE -- Episode 1730 -- Pictured: Host Tiffany Haddish during the Opening Monologue in Studio 8H on Saturday, November 11, 2017 -- (Photo by: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images) NBC\n\nSo, she donned the Alexander McQueen number to appear on SNL. But if you thought that would be the last time you saw the dress, you'd be wrong: Haddish chose to wear the halter-top dress once again to hand out the Oscar for Best Animated/Live Action Short with Maya Rudolph at the 2018 Academy Awards.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d07c0b6a8736f447859bcbd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/luke-hannah.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1bae2199d04e00097edf57/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/M8DLIME_EC014.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d10bdfffe47b1e714f2745c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1157867029.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9cc57099ea9a2ba3431b82/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-927298310.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9cc8a6c0cda831d24f4442/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-873080598.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d000c0ab1802a03e8653d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1014153064.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d25c756495aa2000a9c5537/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1154845796.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9cc79577c6a92acd888717/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-817020296.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccd3d19724717d28d5996/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-927300596.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccab6fb204a1bd58402c7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-dress.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c6c7d7efe05cf2db64d5038/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/khloe-tristan.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1639cc0e99880008ad03a0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1153554653.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d06be98816c482269028ae7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1153313006.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccab6fb204a1bd58402c7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-dress.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Ana Col\u00f3n", "Julyssa Lopez", "Melissa Minto", "Krystin Arneson", "Christopher Rosa", "Avery Matera", "Jessica Radloff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/tiffany-haddish-rewore-alexander-mcqueen-dress-2018-oscars", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Wore Her Favorite Alexander McQueen Dress to Present at the 2018 Oscars", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "While presenting at the 2018 Oscars with Maya Rudolph, Tiffany Haddish wore the same white Alexander McQueen dress she wore on Saturday Night Live.", "keywords": "snd,tiffany haddish,Oscars,oscars 2018", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "She brought the gown out (again) to present at the 2018 Oscars.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccab6fb204a1bd58402c7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-dress.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Is Keeping Her Promise to Rewear That $4,000 Alexander McQueen Dress", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/tiffany-haddish-rewore-alexander-mcqueen-dress-2018-oscars"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "She brought the gown out (again) to present at the 2018 Oscars.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a9ccab6fb204a1bd58402c7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-dress.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Is Keeping Her Promise to Rewear That $4,000 Alexander McQueen Dress"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
