Me and Jen, we\u2019re going to be involved in each other\u2019s lives forever, so we may be toxic forever.\u201d\n\nBut beyond repairing his relationship with Jen, Ronnie\u2019s focus was on the couple\u2019s infant daughter, Ariana Sky. Determined to get a custody plan in place, he paid a visit to his lawyer\u2019s office to get the paperwork in motion.\n\n\u201cI have to make a change for my daughter. I have to put a stop to this for Ariana, something has to be done so she has stability and foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need some kind of guidelines, to make sure that she\u2019s all right at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nAnd the rest of the cast was more than happy to give Ronnie his time and space.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super proud of Ron,\u201d Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi said. \u201cHe\u2019s growing up and he\u2019s adulting and he\u2019s figuring out how to handle situations better.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jersey Shore\u2018s\u2019 Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Apologizes After Public Feud with Girlfriend: \u2018I Acted on My Gut\u2019\n\nNicole, meanwhile, had her own drama to deal with: she and Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley were not in a good place. After days of mounting tension between the BFFs, Jenni decided to leave Vegas early.\n\n\u201cNot cool. How the f\u2014 is that fair? F\u2014 that,\u201d Nicole snapped. \u201cShe only just cares about her f\u2014ing self. What an a\u2014hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicole\u2019s hurt that I\u2019m leaving, but I\u2019m hurt, too,\u201d Jenni said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t [participate] in my Mother\u2019s Day video \u2014 she\u2019s a mom. She should get it. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s the godmother to one of my kids. And then the whole inviting Angelina [Pivarnick]? Come on. This bitch is annoying, and I don\u2019t want to be in the house with her.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jenni \u2018JWoww\u2019 Farley Shares Update on Son, 2, After Revealing His Struggle with Delayed Speech\n\n\u201cNicole and I were keeping secrets from each other,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her when I was booking my flight home, and Nicole didn\u2019t tell me that she invited Angelina. It sucks, but at the same time, it\u2019s like, we obviously have problems. We\u2019re not as close as we thought. I don\u2019t get angry anymore unless I\u2019m really, really hurt \u2014 so this is the end result of me being angry, is that I\u2019m hurt.\u201d\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays (8 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/jenni-farley.jpg",
