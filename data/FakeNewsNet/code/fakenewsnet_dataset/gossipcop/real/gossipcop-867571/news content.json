The two pose around life-size versions of the fashion house\u2019s new monogram logo, \u201cF is Fendi,\u201d in the playful (yet super-luxe) Karl Lagerfeld-shot photo series.\n\nWhether they\u2019re twinning in jewel-toned dresses or showing off the brand\u2019s latest and greatest sheer organza evening wear and winter-ready coats, we can\u2019t help but dream of what fall fashion has in store for us\u2014even if we\u2019re deep into summer. Oh, and those colorful F hoop earrings? They\u2019d send any logo enthusiast\u2019s heart aflutter. Hair extraordinaire Sam McKnight kept Jenner\u2019s locks sleek and straight and gave Hadid a retro-inspired \u2018do, while both sported smoldering makeup by Peter Phillips. (Thanks to them, we now know what our go-to fall beauty looks will be.)\n\nBut really, what\u2019s a bigger BFF milestone than starring alongside your pal in a luxury fashion campaign? If they weren't considered fashion icons before, they certainly are now.\n\nClick through the gallery below to check out the campaign in full.", "images": ["https://nylon-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F18430979%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/Apdq3k1TJ2GolvPO/img.jpg", "https://assets.rbl.ms/19008645/2000x.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?cv=2.0&cj=1&c1=2&c2=17186550&c6=Fashion&c8=BFFs+Kendall+And+Gigi+Just+Scored+A+New+Fashion+Campaign", "https://assets.rbl.ms/19088955/2000x.png"], "top_img": "https://nylon-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F18430979%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/Apdq3k1TJ2GolvPO/img.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Igneri", "Bailey Calfee", "Allison Stubblebine", "Tembe Denton-Hurst", "Sesali Bowen", "Grant Rindner", "Caitlin Wolper"], "canonical_link": "https://nylon.com/articles/kendall-jenner-gigi-hadid-fendi-fall-2017", "title": "BFFs Kendall And Gigi Just Scored A New Fashion Campaign", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@", "image": "https://assets.rbl.ms/18430979/980x.jpg?1563005888"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1332028133512923}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://nylon.com/articles/kendall-jenner-gigi-hadid-fendi-fall-2017", "site_name": "NYLON", "image": {"identifier": "https://nylon-img.rbl.ms/simage/https%3A%2F%2Fassets.rbl.ms%2F18430979%2F980x.jpg/2000%2C2000/Apdq3k1TJ2GolvPO/img.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 2000}, "title": "BFFs Kendall And Gigi Just Scored A New Fashion Campaign", "description": "\u201cF is Fendi\u201d"}, "article": {"section": "Fashion", "publisher": 60772646764, "published_time": "2017-07-17T17:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-01-10T20:32:34+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/60772646764"}, "referrer": "always", "theme-color": "#647187", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "jOnt41cT1_AQeKXtlLnkxf2lxC7abvZ0uxLoe-6Kxco", "keywords": "fashion, fendi, gigi hadid, kendall jenner, news", "description": "\u201cF is Fendi\u201d"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500310800.0, "source": "https://nylon.com", "summary": ""}
