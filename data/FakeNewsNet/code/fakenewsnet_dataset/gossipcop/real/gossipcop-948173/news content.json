(Which husband Cory Hardrict picked out!)\n\n\u201cThis is baby Cairo. Her name is Cairo Tiahna Hardrict. Cairo, it basically means victorious. My husband was in the air, flying. He always feels like he\u2019s closer to his mother when he\u2019s up in the air. He said when he was flying, he saw the letters A, I, R, in the sky. He said he wanted the baby\u2019s name to have those letters. Tiahna is spelled T-I-A-H-N-A so it has Tia in there. Tiahna actually means follower of Christ. Also, Tiahna is one of the first African princesses so she\u2019s our little princess here!\u201d\n\nThe actress and The Oath actor announced that they were having baby number two in November 2017 and shared that they\u2019d be welcoming a daughter in January. The couple who wed in April 2008, has a son, Cree Taylor.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f A post shared by tiamowry (@tiamowry) on Nov 8, 2017 at 10:20am PST\n\nMowry-Hardrict had been vocal about her struggle with endometriosis and was in denial about pregnancy the second time around.
