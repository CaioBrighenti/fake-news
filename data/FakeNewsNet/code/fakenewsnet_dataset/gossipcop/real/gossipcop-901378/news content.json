Chloe Bailey, Halle Bailey and Luka Sabbat also recur in the series.\n\nRELATED: The Sweetest Things Selena Gomez and Her Best Friend (and Kidney Donor) Francia Raisa Have Said About One Another\n\nThe following week, fans can catch the premiere of Alone Together, the irreverent buddy comedy from executive producers Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone \u2014 the Lonely Island trio \u2014 starring stand-up comedians Esther Povitsky and Benji Aflalo.\n\nThe two play a pair of overlooked millennial misfits from different backgrounds \u2014 with a strictly platonic friendship \u2014 trying to find their place in the status-obsessed culture of Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI saved you from a walk of shame,\u201d he says in PEOPLE\u2019s exclusive sneak peek, above.\n\n\u201cThe walk of shame is an anti-feminist construct,\u201d she responds.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a feminist \u2014 you\u2019re just too lazy to walk,\u201d he retorts.\n\nThroughout the season, the dynamic duo\u2019s misadventures include shooting their own music video, standing in line for a Lip Kit Pop Up and even trying their hand at retirement life.\n\nThe special two-episode premiere of grown-ish airs Jan. 3 at 8 p.m. ET, and Alone Together premieres Jan. 10 at 8:30 p.m. ET, both on Freeform.", "images":
