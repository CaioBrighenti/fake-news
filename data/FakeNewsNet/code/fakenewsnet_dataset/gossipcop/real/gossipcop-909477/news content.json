Those voters will vote for what they believe in. We\u2019ve got to do what we can to get the most people to say this is the best thing. Somebody said to me the other day: If you\u2019re a kid and you\u2019re selling cookies, you might think you\u2019ve got the best cookies on the block. But if nobody else knows that, then you don\u2019t have the best cookies.\n\nThe last time we spoke, \u201c4:44\u201d was extremely fresh \u2014 you finished it days before it came out. How has your estimation of the album changed over time?\n\nI\u2019ve loved the appreciation that people have for it, but I moved on until today. I distanced myself and I\u2019ve just been studying, working hard, thinking of new things to bring to music. I\u2019ve got a philosophy I call \u201cno dancing in the end zone.\u201d You score, get back and run another play.\n\nDo you think the fact that \u201c4:44\u201d paired a rapper with a single producer resonated with the Grammy audience?\n\nI would guess it probably did. Some probably just heard it as a body of work that sounds like a body of work. That\u2019s always been key in other genres \u2014 albums that sound like albums. Cohesive. I think it\u2019s a testament as well to what we can accomplish by not following the trendy way in \u2014 making the albums a little too compilation-esque in their production. But I would still give it to [Jay-Z\u2019s] honesty and me scoring his honestly as the ultimate thing.\n\nWhat does it mean for Jay\u2019s legacy that he was able to put out an album of this caliber at the age of 47? Rap is so often a young man\u2019s game.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/arts/30grammys-noid-sub/30NOID-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/arts/30grammy-noid2/merlin_126415883_3464863a-fba6-4cfd-b4a3-87d9892e7b23-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/arts/30grammys-noid-sub/30NOID-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/arts/30grammys-noid-sub/30NOID-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/arts/music/jay-z-no-id-444-grammy-nominations.html", "title": "Jay-Z\u2019s Producer No I.D. on the Grammys: \u2018Urban Culture Is Now Pop Culture\u2019", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-11-29T15:51:26.000Z", "modified": "2017-11-29T15:51:25.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-coscarelli", "tag": "4:44 (Album)"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005576687, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/8c9e8a57-13c8-51b2-a20a-c0593c0858e6", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/bf4d28e6e726427984533859b617e007", "description": "The man behind the music for Jay-Z\u2019s \u201c4:44\u201d received five nominations, including producer of the year.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/arts/30grammys-noid-sub/30NOID-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Joe Coscarelli", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/arts/30grammys-noid-sub/30NOID-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Rap and Hip-Hop,Grammys,Jay Z,Dion Wilson, No ID,4:44", "pdate": 20171129, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/arts/music/jay-z-no-id-444-grammy-nominations.html", "type": "article", "title": "Jay-Z\u2019s Producer No I.D. on the Grammys: \u2018Urban Culture Is Now Pop Culture\u2019", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/arts/30grammys-noid-sub/30NOID-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "The man behind the music for Jay-Z\u2019s \u201c4:44\u201d received five nominations, including producer of the year."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/arts/music/jay-z-no-id-444-grammy-nominations.html", "title": "Jay-Z\u2019s Producer No I.D. on the Grammys: \u2018Urban Culture Is Now Pop Culture\u2019", "description": "The man behind the music for Jay-Z\u2019s \u201c4:44\u201d received five nominations, including producer of the year.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/arts/30grammys-noid-sub/30NOID-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "The producer No I.D. received five Grammy nominations for work that included his full-album production of Jay-Z&rsquo;s &ldquo;4:44.&rdquo;"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005576687"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "arts", "SCG": "music", "CN": "grammy-awards", "CT": "news-event", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/arts/music/jay-z-no-id-444-grammy-nominations.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005576687", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/arts/music/jay-z-no-id-444-grammy-nominations.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/arts/music/jay-z-no-id-444-grammy-nominations.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511931600.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
