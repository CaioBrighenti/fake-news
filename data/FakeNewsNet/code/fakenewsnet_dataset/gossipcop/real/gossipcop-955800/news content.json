According to court documents obtained by The Blast, she breached a stipulation of settlement in her divorce by failing to create a trust \u201cfor the benefit of her two children.\u201d\n\nThe source close to mother of two said that lawsuit was a driving factor in her heading to rehab.\n\n\u201cDue to the trauma of being sued by her kids and ex husband, Luann decided to set the reset button and check herself into rehab,\u201d the insider said. \u201cShe read about it in the press which was devastating and after that, needed to work on herself and digest everything and be self-reflective.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lawyers are speaking on both sides and Luann is hoping for a speedy resolution because she loves her children very much,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe Real
