Troy Bolton was good at two things during his reign as the superstar athlete in High School Musical \u2014 basketball and singing. Yet, Zac Efron, who is known for playing the role of Troy, didn't actually sing in the first High School Musical movie. Basically, he just lip-synced to another singer's voice and the world took it as his own.\n\nZac has since owned up to the fact that it was a singer by the name of Drew Seeley whose voice HSM fanatics fell in love with and not his.
