She also founded the Right Action for Women, which helps at-risk women pay for MRI screenings and testing.\n\nBut the actress revealed in a TODAY.com exclusive that she recently took an additional step to prevent another cancer diagnosis: She had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. Read on for our conversation with the actress, who\u2019s busy raising her daughter Sadie, 6, with musician hubby Martyn LeNoble.\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s catch up on your health. How are you doing?\n\nYou're the first person I'm telling this. Two weeks ago, I had my ovaries and [fallopian] tubes removed. My cousin passed away from ovarian cancer in 2008. I could prevent that. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve taken control of everything. It\u2019s a relief. That\u2019s one other thing off the table. Now, let\u2019s hope I don\u2019t get hit by a bus.\n\nWhat message do you want to send to women?\n\nIf you\u2019re BRCA positive, it\u2019s highly possible you\u2019ll develop cancer in your lifetime. The first thing is to be really diligent about what you\u2019re putting into your body, as far as what kind of food you\u2019re eating. Organic is expensive. I get that. I don\u2019t want to alienate anyone who can\u2019t pay for that. But maybe skip your morning latte and get organic vegetables for the week. Try to stay away from the foods that are filled with chemicals. Be a little more diligent and carve out as much of the bad stuff that you can. The other big killer is stress. That\u2019s a hard thing to say to people especially right now. We\u2019re living in a bizarre time. We\u2019re bombarded by what\u2019s going on in our world. Breathe deeper. That\u2019s a big one for me. I used to be a stressed out person. I\u2019m not anymore. I try to find the lining in everything in life.\n\nChristina Applegate Stacie McChesney / Getty Images\n\nI know you eat super clean.\n\nWe grow our own vegetables. That\u2019s not an option for everyone. But just get a tomato plant! We\u2019re a 100 percent organic house. My daughter is a vegetarian and practically vegan. That\u2019s her choice. That\u2019s how she eats. We\u2019re really conscious about what we buy. Get some kale! Plant some green kale in your backyard and throw it into everything.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty impressive that you founded Right Action for Women, because these tests cost a fortune and most women can\u2019t afford them.\n\nWe\u2019re at this place where we need to sit down and figure out the future of what it is that we\u2019re doing and get into more of the BRCA tests for women. That\u2019s a huge cost for a lot of people who don\u2019t have perfect insurance. If you do know you have the gene, it gives you an empowerment about your lifestyle. I\u2019ve been a stay-at-home mom and focusing on my daughter the last two years. We\u2019re moving forward now.\n\nIt must weigh on you that you have a daughter, and it must make breast cancer that much more of a personal issue\n\nOf course. The chances that my daughter is BRCA positive are very high. I look at her and feed her the cleanest foods. I try to keep her stress levels down. I\u2019m doing everything I can on my end knowing that in 20 years, she\u2019ll have to start getting tested. Hopefully by then there will be advancements. It breaks my heart to think that\u2019s a possibility.\n\nDo you get checked out regularly?\n\nI don\u2019t need mammograms anymore. I don\u2019t have breasts. I go every six months to my oncologist. It used to be every three months. They still check me out as if I had all my parts. That\u2019s never going to go away. If you know you\u2019re high risk, you need to go start as soon as possible.\n\nOtherwise, what\u2019s your life like these days?\n\nI feel good. I keep my life really simple. I\u2019m very fortunate right now to have that freedom to not work. I love being my daughter\u2019s mother and being 24/7 here with her, doing what I need to do, making her meals, taking her to soccer. I work at her school six or seven hours a week. I\u2019m all in. That is my job. I love my life right now. I\u2019ve been very fortunate to be able to take a minute and it\u2019s been wonderful.", "images": ["https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_41/1288343/christina-applegate-today-171011-tease_35a9f96eed9864f427b8fb7e37d2f493.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_41/1288343/christina-applegate-today-171011-tease_35a9f96eed9864f427b8fb7e37d2f493.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/health/christina-applegate-reveals-she-had-her-ovaries-fallopian-tubes-removed-t117380", "title": "Actress Christina Applegate reveals she had her ovaries, fallopian tubes removed", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/health/christina-applegate-reveals-she-had-her-ovaries-fallopian-tubes-removed-t117380", "title": "Actress Christina Applegate reveals she had her ovaries, fallopian tubes removed", "description": "The actress revealed to TODAY that she recently took an additional step to prevent another cancer diagnosis.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_41/1288343/christina-applegate-today-171011-tease_35a9f96eed9864f427b8fb7e37d2f493.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_41/1288343/christina-applegate-today-171011-tease_35a9f96eed9864f427b8fb7e37d2f493.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_41/1288343/christina-applegate-today-171011-tease_35a9f96eed9864f427b8fb7e37d2f493.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Actress Christina Applegate reveals she had her ovaries, fallopian tubes removed", "description": "The actress revealed to TODAY that she recently took an additional step to prevent another cancer diagnosis.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The actress revealed to TODAY that she recently took an additional step to prevent another cancer diagnosis.", "thumbnail": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_41/1288343/christina-applegate-today-171011-tease_35a9f96eed9864f427b8fb7e37d2f493.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507752120.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
