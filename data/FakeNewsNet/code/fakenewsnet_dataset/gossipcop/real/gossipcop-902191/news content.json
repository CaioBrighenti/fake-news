But after trying tons of different remedies, Kardashian finally found something that\u2019s working.\n\nThis morning, Kardashian woke up to the best gift she could receive and showed fans her near-perfect skin on her Instagram story.\n\n\u201cOMG my psoriasis is almost gone! Best Christmas present!\u201d she captioned the shot of her legs.\n\nImage zoom Donato Sardella/Getty Images for The Tot\n\nLooking for more style content?

Sometimes I just feel like it\u2019s my big flaw and everyone knows about it, so why cover it? After this many years, I\u2019ve really learned to live with it.\u201d\n\nWhen Kardashian first discovered the psoriasis appearing on her legs in 2011 captured on an episode of KUWTK, she wasn\u2019t as accepting of the diagnosis.\n\nThe star visited Dr. Harold Lancer and once he confirmed she had psoriasis, Kardashian said, \u201cWhen the doctor tells me I have psoriasis I have heard of it before because my mom has always had it. But my mom didn\u2019t have red, flaky dots all over her.\u201d\n\nShe immediately worried about how psoriasis would affect her career in the spotlight.\n\n\u201cMy career is doing ad campaigns and swimsuit photo shoots. People don\u2019t understand the pressure on me to look perfect,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cImagine what the tabloids would do to me if they saw all these spots.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lippie.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dirty-lemon-retinol_5.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sk-ii-timelines-with-katie-couric.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C8220px%2C4315.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/image_uploaded_from_ios_10242.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/naomi-campbell-makeup.jpg?crop=0px%2C13px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/amazon-teigen.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/nordstrom-anniversary-sale.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/priscilla-valles-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C192px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1144507555.jpg?crop=0px%2C230px%2C3275px%2C1719px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jaclyn-hill-jen-atkin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-85319459.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kim-kardashian-north-west.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/meghan-markle-mascara-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C1150px%2C604px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sarahpotempa-rgb.jpg?crop=0px%2C539px%2C3611px%2C1898px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kylie-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/kim-kardashian7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/nastia-lukin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1351px%2C709.275px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lumee.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C608px%2C319.2px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lady-gaga-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/alyssa-edwards.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/brittany-jax-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C853px%2C447.825px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/da5e7d01afedc1c31666e045b98aacc4?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/best-fanbase-51.jpg?crop=0px%2C29px%2C1150px%2C604px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlyn Frey"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-psoriasis-almost-gone/", "title": "Kim Kardashian's Psoriasis is Almost Completely Gone", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "kim kardashian psoriasis, kim kardashian psoriasis treatment, kim kardashian skincare, kim kardashian beauty products, kim kardashian skincare routine, kim kardashian beauty routine, kim kardashian makeup routine, kim kardashian's favorite products, beauty products kim kardashian loves", "news_keywords": "kim kardashian psoriasis, kim kardashian psoriasis treatment, kim kardashian skincare, kim kardashian beauty products, kim kardashian skincare routine, kim kardashian beauty routine, kim kardashian makeup routine, kim kardashian's favorite products, beauty products kim kardashian loves", "description": "This is what Kim Kardashian's been using on her psoriasis", "og": {"title": "'Best Christmas Present!'
