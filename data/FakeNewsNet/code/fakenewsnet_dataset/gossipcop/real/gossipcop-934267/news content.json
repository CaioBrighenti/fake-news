I really missed it during my pregnancy. A good sweat sesh can do wonders for the mind,\u201d said Kardashian, who continues to document her sweaty trainings on social media.\n\n\u201cOnce I got the green light from my doctor, Coach Joe was on the next flight to Cleveland \u2014 no joke, LOL,\u201d the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star said about her longtime trainer and go-to KarJenner fitness instructor, who also trains Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nKardashian was spotted heading to the gym in Cleveland on May 8, just three weeks after welcoming her baby girl on April 12 with NBA boyfriend Tristan Thompson.\n\n\u201cOn that first day back, it felt so good to sweat again. Not going to lie, it\u2019s a struggle to get back into the groove. Mentally, I\u2019m strong but physically, it\u2019s just not the same. But every day, I\u2019m one step closer, baby!\u201d the mother of one revealed.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

She didn\u2019t try to slow down or make it easy, but I had to remind her that her body went through some big changes,\u201d Coach Joe remembered. \u201cIn her head, she\u2019s still the same! I had to explain to her all the different steps, with the understanding that we\u2019ll have to start slowly.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cShe was already talking about when we\u2019ll be able to do two workouts a day. That\u2019s how Khlo\u00e9 thinks. I told her we\u2019re not yet in beast mode, but her mind is already there.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Bares Toned Tummy 6 Weeks After Giving Birth \u2014 and Kylie Jenner Follows

Kardashian has been showing off her bare stomach in several mirror selfies on social media.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Khloe Kardashian Shares the First Video of Baby True\n\nOn Sunday, the Revenge Body host proudly lifted up her shirt to show off her toned tummy on her Instagram Story.\n\nKardashian also recently shared how getting back into her old workout routine is \u201cmuch more difficult than I think you\u2019d expect it to be\u201d as she also clapped back at mommy shamers.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m annoyed about is that I\u2019ve read a couple of times on Twitter that, you know, they feel that I\u2019m focusing too much on my body, but the truth is, I\u2019ve worked out five or six days a week before I got pregnant and that\u2019s my sanctuary and something I love to do,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cJust because I have a baby, doesn\u2019t mean I have to stop doing the things that I love, and I love working out and getting my mind right,\u201d Kardashian added.", "images":
