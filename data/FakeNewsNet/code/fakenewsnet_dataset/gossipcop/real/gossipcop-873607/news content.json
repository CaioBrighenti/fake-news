What a shame about that pretty face,\u2019 \u201d according to the Boston Herald.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Top Chef Winner Jeremy Ford Shows How to Make His Delicious Roasted Chicken Recipe\n\n\u201cI felt like he was bullying me, like he was telling me he was going to hit me. I could feel my heart beat in my chest,\u201d Lakshmi said, adding, \u201cI felt threatened.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

\u2013 whose names will be released later this week \u2013 that she was the subject of racist taunts, according to Deadline.\n\nThe court also watched a video recorded by Carbajal in which the protesters called her a \u201cf\u2014\u2014 towel head\u201d and a \u201cc\u2014.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mackenzie-lueck-murder-charge.jpg",
