And according to the man in the middle of the action, Arie Luyendyk Jr., things heat up pretty quickly.\n\nSitting down to chat with E! News, the reality star discussed how things will be different for him this time around. Thanks to his age (at 36, he\u2019s older and wiser than when he first appeared on our screens in 2012) and his new career (he\u2019s still a race car driver, but is doing real estate as well), he seems to be pretty sure of where he\u2019s coming from and what he wants out of this romantic situation.\n\nWhich is not to say he won\u2019t slip up every once in a while. In fact, he did just that on night one of The Bachelor, when he broke a rule he made for himself before the season started.\n\n\u201cThat first night, I told myself I\u2019m NOT going to kiss anybody,\u201d Luyendyk Jr. told E! News when asked if his infamous nickname \u201cThe Kissing Bandit\u201d added any pressure to the circumstances. \u201cAnd then it happened.\u201d That\u2019s right \u2014 he put his make-out skills to good use on the very first night.\n\nHe may have done the one thing that he promised himself he wouldn\u2019t do, but it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s especially upset about it, so we\u2019re going to go ahead and guess that \u201cThe Kissing Bandit\u201d enjoyed that initial peck (or two?).\n\nWe actually already know that Brittany scored herself a smooch when she issued a creative challenge to Luyendyk. But was she the only one?\n\nWe\u2019ll be able to see for ourselves when The Bachelor premieres January 1 on ABC.\n\nDo you have any rules for yourself when it comes to first dates? Let us know @BritandCo!\n\n(Photo via ABC/Craig Sjodin)", "images": ["https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/relationships_header.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://bourbon.britcdn.com/assets/menu-icon.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Style_Content-Hub_1920x260_v4_lighter-version.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Issues_header_1920x5001.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://components.britcdn.com/assets/images/logo.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/beauty_1024.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bachelor-season-22-group1.jpg", "https://components.britcdn.com/assets/images/logo_condensed.svg", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/food_header.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bachelor-season-22-group.jpg?auto=format&q=50", "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/home_header_1920x500.jpg?h=160&auto=format", "https://bourbon.britcdn.com/assets/x-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://images.britcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bachelor-season-22-group1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree O", "Desir\u00e9e O Is A", "Professional Bohemian", "Who Loves Anything", "Everything Related To The Arts", "Entertainment", "Pop Culture.
