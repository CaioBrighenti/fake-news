(ABC/Adam Rose)\n\nIn a not-surprising turn of events, actor Jordan Fisher won \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d Season 25 on Tuesday night. No one else really had a shot \u2014 he triumphed over violinist Lindsey Stirling, the runner-up, and actor Frankie Muniz, the third-place finisher.\n\n\u201cYour skills are just ridiculously out of this world,\u201d judge Carrie Ann Inaba raved to Fisher after his final performance with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.\n\n\u201cI think you are the most complete male celebrity ever on \u2018Dancing with the Stars,\u2019 \u201d Len Goodman added.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right up there with the best we\u2019ve seen on this show!\u201d Bruno Tonioli exclaimed.\n\nIn addition to the love from the judges, Fisher had this thing locked up from the start. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1) He\u2019s already a trained dancer \u2014 and it showed.\n\nSeem unfair? Quite a few viewers on social media thought so, given Fisher\u2019s background \u2014 he starred in two roles in \u201cHamilton\u201d on Broadway and has years of theater experience. This is a common \u201cDWTS\u201d controversy: Last year, some fans weren\u2019t too pleased that Heather Morris, a former Beyonc\u00e9 backup dancer, was competing against amateurs.\n\nBefore the season started, AL.com wrote that Fisher \u201cdownplays the Internet chatter that calls him as a ringer.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing into this, you would think that somebody with a dance background will go in and exceed and excel,\u201d Fisher, an Alabama native, told the site. \u201cBut I\u2019m learning from scratch. All ballroom is new to me. All ballroom, period. The end. Never done it. I\u2019ve never felt so uncoordinated in my whole life.\u201d\n\n2) He has the Disney fanbase.\n\nCorporate synergy might have played a role in Fisher being cast as a contestant. \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d airs on ABC, owned by the same parent company as Freeform (where Fisher starred in \u201cThe Secret Life of the American Teenager\u201d) and the Disney Channel (where Fisher starred in \u201cLiv and Maddie\u201d and \u201cTeen Beach 2.\u201d) He also sang on the end credits song in Disney\u2019s \u201cMoana\u201d and has songs played on Radio Disney.\n\nAll of that is to say \u2014 it\u2019s never a bad thing to have loyal Disney fans in your corner, especially those who can vote for you on a reality dancing competition.\n\n3) He also has a gymnastics background.\n\nFisher was once an aspiring Olympic gymnast \u2014 those skills really help out with tricky routines on \u201cDWTS.\u201d Just ask winners Shawn Johnson or Laurie Hernandez, along with finalists Aly Raisman and Simone Biles. As everyone knows, athletes in general do quite well on this show.\n\n\n\nFrankie Muniz and Witney Carson; Lindsay Arnold and Jordan Fisher; and Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas in the finale.
