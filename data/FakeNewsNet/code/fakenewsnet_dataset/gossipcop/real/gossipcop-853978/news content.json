Dying in the last song he ever played live.\n\nThe musician, who died from suicide hours after performing with his band Soundgarden in Detroit on Wednesday, looped in the rock band's version of the gospel song to a rendition of Soundgarden hit Rusty Cage.\n\nLyrics from In My Time of Dying first appeared in songbooks in the 1920s, and it has since been re-interpreted by musicians such as Blind Willie Johnson (in 1927), Bob Dylan (1962) and Led Zeppelin (1975).", "images":
