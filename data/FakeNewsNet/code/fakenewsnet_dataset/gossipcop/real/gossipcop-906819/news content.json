However, the Girls creator shared that she is not parting with the piece of jewelry he gave her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing this ring that Jack gave me, and I\u2019ll always wear it because love is a really cool, powerful, eternal thing,\u201d Dunham, 31, explained to fans via an Instagram livestream. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be defined the way that we, in Western culture, define it as beginnings and ends.\u201d\n\nThe actress has previously shown off some of her jewelry from Antonoff, revealing he gifted her a \u201cfriendship ring\u201d for their anniversary in April 2016.\n\nShe continued, \u201cThings can be, \u2018You know what, you\u2019re a drop of water, and then you reenter the ocean.\u2019 Anyway, I really love you all. I\u2019m really thankful for the support. I\u2019m really thankful for the love.\u201d\n\nThe Girls creator and Bleachers frontman met on a blind date set up by Antonoff\u2019s sister Rachel and comedian Mike Birbiglia in 2012.\n\nThis past October, Dunham and Antonoff celebrated their five-and-a-half year anniversary, which she celebrated with a photo of the couple donning sweats while out to dinner.\n\n\u201cHere is the picture that my \u2764\ufe0f @americaferrera insisted on taking so we\u2019d have evidence that this is how we dressed for a nice dinner. Our 5.5 year anniversary was yesterday,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cStill working hard to impress him in surprising ways. PS we independently dressed entirely in merch.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/emma-justin-ts.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630",
