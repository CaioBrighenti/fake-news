In order to get the classic \u2018S\u2019 wave shape associated with the glamor of Hollywood, you\u2019ll needto use a curling iron. Take a 1.5 inch curling wand and curl your hair in sections. As you create each curl, take it in your palm and let it cool, then gently clip to your head using sectioning clips. Leave to cool completely to set the wave.\n\nStep 4: Once cooled, release the clips and pull down each curl gently. This should give you perfect control, but if you find the curls a little tight or stiff, use a wide toothed comb to soften them.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Mist over Perfectly un(Done) Ultra Brushable Hair Spray to secure the bounce \u2013 the weightless formulation with Fleximax Fixers helps hold your look without stiffness.\n\n\n\nSo what are you waiting for?
