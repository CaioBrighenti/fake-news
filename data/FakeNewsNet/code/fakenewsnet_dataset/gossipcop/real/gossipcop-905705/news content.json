They\u2019ve spent a long time creating all of these memorable moments and that\u2019s exciting for me to because I really do consider myself part of the Pepsi family.\u201d\n\nFor Crawford, this commercial (catch a 6-second teaser above!) was extra meaningful because it also brought together the generations in her own family. Her 18-year-old son Presley Gerber stars alongside her in the spot.\n\n\u201cTo include now my next generation, Presley, just makes it that much more familial feeling,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope it gives people that warm, fuzzy feeling.\u201d\n\nCrawford says to work with Presley at this point in his career was \u201cexciting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe drove to work together, we shared a trailer, and just as a mom watching him perform, I was the proud stage mom standing by the monitor,\u201d she says.\n\nImage zoom Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty\n\nAnd Crawford\u2019s 16-year-old daughter Kaia Gerber had a little FOMO when she heard about the commercial.\n\n\u201cI was saying to Kaia, \u2018Presley and I are doing this commercial\u2019 and she was like, \u2018Wait, Presley and you? What about me?,'\u201d Crawford shared. \u201cI said, \u2018Your time will come, honey, don\u2019t worry.\u2019 I think it would be fun for her to get to really re-create my original spot.\u201d (The supermodel-in-training has already shared a Versace catwalk with her mom, so we think there\u2019s a good chance that\u2019ll happen.)\n\nImage zoom Courtesy Pepsi\n\nSpeaking about her debut Pepsi commercial, Crawford reveals that she still has those iconic denim cut-offs.\n\n\u201cThey were my jeans that I wore that day and when we were doing wardrobe the stylist asked to just cut my jeans off,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause your own jeans always fit you better if you\u2019ve worn them awhile, so we just cut off my jeans and I got to keep my own jeans.\u201d\n\nCrawford wore the same cutoffs for the spot 10 years later, which had a cameo from her very young children.\n\n\u201cMy kids were little so this actually Presley\u2019s second Pepsi commercial,\u201d she says. \u201cThe car in that one is not a Lamborghini, it\u2019s an SUV, and I\u2019ve got my two little kids in the back so they have been part of the Pepsi family really since they were little.\u201d\n\nBut this time her look was totally different: a denim shirt, white jeans and boots.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the shorts would still fit but this time we didn\u2019t want to bring them back because the commercial is about passing onto the next generation, it was a nod to the old commercial without wearing the exact same outfit,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cTime has gone on and I have an 18-year-old son now. I think Kaia will wear them one day.\u201d\n\nSo what is Super Bowl Sunday like at the Gerber household?\n\n\u201cIt involves chili and some wings and Pepsi of course, and probably at a certain point, margaritas,\u201d Crawford shares. \u201cIt\u2019s about the tradition of getting together. Some years I watch less of the football, but I always look forward to the commercials and the halftime show. I think we are all in our busy current lifestyles, and we appreciate those things that bring people together. If you think about it that\u2019s why award shows are fun too because you have a group of people sitting around together doing a shared experience \u2014 it\u2019s social. And for me I love the social moment of the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nSee the full reveal of Crawford\u2019s new Pepsi spot during Super Bowl LII on February 4 on NBC.", "images":
