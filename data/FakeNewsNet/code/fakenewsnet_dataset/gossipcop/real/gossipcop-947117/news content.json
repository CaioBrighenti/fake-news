(\u201cI don\u2019t even think lesbian is the right identity for me,\u201d she quips. \u201cI identify as tired.\u201d) But midway through, Gadsby starts methodically dissecting how comedy works to explain why she needs to quit stand-up altogether.\n\n\u201cI built a career out of self-deprecation, and I don\u2019t want to do that anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause you do understand what self -deprecation means from somebody who already exists in the margins? It\u2019s not humility. It\u2019s humiliation.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll laugh, but you also may cry several times while watching \u201cNanette.\u201d It\u2019s not a comedy special that offers escapist laughs but, instead, demands that the audience not shy away from considering harsh truths.\n\n[Grappling not only with Louis C.K., but sexism and power in comedy]\n\nWeeks after the show premiered on Netflix, fellow comedians are still buzzing about the hour and how it calls into question the common comedic devices performers have relied upon for so long.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a professional comic for 30 years. I\u2019ve been studying comedy for even longer. I thought I had seen everything \u2026 until I watched Nanette,\u201d tweeted comedian Kathy Griffin. \u201cI was blown away. I urge you to watch it ASAP \u2013 one hour and it\u2019ll change your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most incredible, powerful, wrenching pieces of comedy and art I have ever seen,\u201d tweeted comedian Aparna Nancherla.\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s gonna linger for a while and will influence a whole generation of comedians,\u201d comedian Jenny Yang tweeted. \u201cIf I don\u2019t change how I do comedy after seeing her special, why even?\u201d\n\nRecorded at the Sydney Opera House, \u201cNanette\u201d won best comedy show at Edinburgh Fringe in 2017 before Gadsby brought it to New York City for several months.\n\nIn the show, Gadsby presents a treatise on the mythology of being an artist \u2014 that to be creative you must suffer \u2014 and zeros in on the women made to suffer for the sake of protecting men\u2019s\u2019 reputations. She also explains that comedy needs tension for punchlines to work, but she\u2019s tired of tension. As a child, her very existence created tension, so she learned to use humor to deflect.\n\nStill, Gadsby plays with tension in the special, using silences and alternating between calm setups and explosions of fury for maximum emotional impact.\n\nOther recent specials have showcased comics\u2019 masterful use of timing, silence and discomfort. In her sophomore 2018 Netflix special, \u201cHard Knock Wife,\u201d Ali Wong quietly and unhurriedly lays the groundwork for her jokes before she explodes into cascading punchlines. And Tig Notaro famously told jokes about her just-received cancer diagnosis to an unsuspecting audience in 2013\u2019s \u201cLive,\u201d greeting their applause with, \u201cHello! I have cancer, how are ya?\u201d\n\n[Comedy\u2019s next big star Michelle Wolf doesn\u2019t want to make a point \u2014 she just wants to make you laugh]\n\nBut Gadsby does something else within \u201cNanette.\u201d She uses comedic elements like joke callbacks while also breaking comedy into its component parts for the audience.\n\n\u201cI feel like in a comedy show there\u2019s no room for the best part of the story, which is the ending,\u201d she says. \u201cIn order to finish on a laugh, you have to end with punchlines.\u201d\n\nSo Gadsby goes back and undoes her earlier punchlines. Early in the special, she gets laughs with jokes about a dimwitted, homophobic man at a bus stop and the time she \u201cforgot\u201d to come out to her grandmother. But later, she tells the rest of those real stories, including the devastating parts she had to leave out to get laughs.\n\nShe remains in control, bringing in silly asides even as she unleashes anger, like when she skewers comics who turned Monica Lewinsky into \u201can easy punchline\u201d instead of mocking \u201cthe man who abused his power.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to be angry on a comedy stage,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople feel safer when men do the angry comedy; they\u2019re the kings of the genre. When I do it, I\u2019m just a miserable lesbian ruining all the fun and the banter. When men do it, \u2018heroes of free speech!\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut even after she showcases the power of her anger, she ends by offering a final argument against anger, as well: \u201cIt knows no other purpose than to spread blind hatred, and I want no part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to unite you with laughter or anger,\u201d she says. \u201cI just needed my story felt and understood.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe new rock stars: Inside today\u2019s golden age of comedy\n\nBreaking news, last-minute Kanye jokes: How to make late-night TV in the Trump era", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hnzgumNGNKlrAZ9wP1Tp3WD5_KQ=/1024x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6U6325RE7M543NXI75R6MNJ3CU.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TbPyjLyZ8Miz4xbgLOu5s0ZzuQE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PK2MYG5FHQYYHFUOB5I7ROFY4M.png"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/TbPyjLyZ8Miz4xbgLOu5s0ZzuQE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PK2MYG5FHQYYHFUOB5I7ROFY4M.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer", "July", "Elahe Izadi Is A Pop Culture Writer For The Washington Post.
