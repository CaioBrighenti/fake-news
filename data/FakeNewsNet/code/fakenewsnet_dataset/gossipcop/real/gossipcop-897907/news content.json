On the cover, Swift is shown in an embellished red dress by YSL that screams fashion-over-function, swapping her classic red lip for a deep purple tone.\n\nSwift thanked the editor -- who referred to her as \"indomitable\" upon revealing the cover -- as well as both photographers, in an Instagram post early Monday (Dec. 4). \"Thank you @edward_enninful and @mertalas for your passion, spirit, and contagious laughter on set,\" Swift noted. \"Mert and Marcus took these photos for @britishvogue and my album photos for reputation, and it\u2019s been such a bonding experience working together so closely and talking so much about what we wanted to make. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done a magazine cover. I\u2019m really happy my first one back was with such wonderful people. #newvogue.\"", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Stubblebine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8055047/taylor-swift-vogue-uk-jan-2018-cover", "title": "British 'Vogue' Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Taylor Swift Stars in British 'Vogue' January Cover Story", "description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "og": {"title": "British 'Vogue' Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8055047/taylor-swift-vogue-uk-jan-2018-cover", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8055047/taylor-swift-vogue-uk-jan-2018-cover", "title": "British 'Vogue' Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
