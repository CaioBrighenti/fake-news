A few people who were seen at her celebration included Chris Brown, her brother Prince Jackson, Paris Hilton, Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross at HYDE Sunset in West Hollywood.\n\nParis shined at her celebration in a retro 60\u2019s inspired look with stand out pink hair. She also had a beautiful custom birthday cake in which she enlisted the help of Chris Brown to blow out her candles. Overall, it seems like Paris had a great birthday and is on the road towards positivity and growth as an aspiring model and actress.\n\n2013 was a heavy year for 15-year-old Paris, as she struggled to get out of her depression and anxiety that led to her attempted suicide. Recently, she shared a bit about that time saying \u201cIt was just self-hatred, low self-esteem, thinking that I couldn\u2019t do anything right, not thinking I was worthy of living anymore, I\u2019m a completely different person\u2026I was crazy. I was actually crazy.\u201d\n\nParis is a different person now, as she has the support of her family and friends. Other notable attendees to her party included Thirty Seconds To Mars\u2019 Jared Leto and other members of the Hilton family, including Kathy, Ricky, and Paris Hilton\u2019s Fianc\u00e9e, Chris Zylka.", "images": ["http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-10.23.03-PM.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/paris.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_twitter_online_social_media_734367.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_instagram_online_social_media_photo_734395.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jermaine-Dupri-on-Current-State-of-Female-Rap-Its-Like-Strippers-Rapping.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/source-logo_red_120x26px.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10321959f.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lil-Wayne005.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/11183302536_fe67fbb8e7_b.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_online_social_media_facebook_734386.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tyga-Cancels-Show-in-Sweden-Following-AAP-Rocky-Arrest.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/nike-tie-dye-sneaker-pack-chicago-1.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-11.30.40-PM.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10144111n.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cardi-B-on-Jermaine-Dupris-Strippers-Rapping-Comment-It-Seems-Like-Thats-What-People-Wanna-Hear.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toni-Braxton-Testifies-Against-Man-Who-Stole-her-1M-Engagement-Ring.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2pac-madonna-love-letter-auction.jpg"], "top_img": "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/paris.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://thesource.com/2018/04/08/paris-jackson-celebrates-20th-with-chris-brown-paris-hilton-more/", "title": "Paris Jackson Celebrates 20th with Chris Brown, Paris Hilton and More", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Paris Jackson turned 20 earlier this week ad she brought in the New Year amongst close family and friends.
