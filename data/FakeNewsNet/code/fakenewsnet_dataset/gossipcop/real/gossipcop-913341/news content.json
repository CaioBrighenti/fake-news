Doing it with one of your best friends!\n\nFigure skaters Adam Rippon and Mirai Nagasu led the U.S. team to bronze at the 2018 Winter Olympics, and the win is extra special for the longtime skating buds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re roommates here, staying at the Olympic Village,\u201d Rippon, 28, told NBC Olympics. \u201cWe gave each other a hug and I said, \u2018You know, Mirai, we\u2019re here! We did it!\u2019 \u201c\n\nNagasu, 24, made history on Monday when she became the very first American female to land a triple axel at the Olympics.\n\nImage zoom Valery Sharifulin/TASS/Getty\n\n\u201cI love my girl and so proud of her tonight,\u201d Rippon said of Nagasu\u2019s performance. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this my whole life, then to see my friend go out there and skate like that is even better.\u201d\n\nKeep Following PEOPLE\u2019s Complete Coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nMeanwhile, Rippon captured the internet\u2019s heart thanks to his attention-grabbing free skate in the figure skating team event.\n\nFour years ago, Adam Rippon and Mirai Nagasu were eating hamburgers on a rooftop after missing the #WinterOlympics. Tonight, they dazzled. https://t.co/fmMl0C4Amf pic.twitter.com/CouGAilAu5 \u2014 NBC Olympics (@NBCOlympics) February 12, 2018\n\nThe two have become fan-favorites at the Games, with Nagasu drawing kudos from figure skating icons, and Rippon striking internet fame. But just four years ago, the friends found themselves in tears after they narrowly missed an opportunity to participate in the 2014 Sochi Games.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, we got In-N-Out [Burger]. We went back to her house,\u201d Rippon recalled to NBC. \u201cWe climbed up to the roof of her house and we were eating In-N-Out because we were so upset that we weren\u2019t at the Olympic Games.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Richard Heathcote/Getty\n\nRELATED: The Most Spectacular Photos from Olympic Opening Ceremonies Past\n\nThe athletes sported wide smiles as they appeared on NBC with the medal. In a gif, Nagasu and Rippon are shown gushing over the win. Nagasu quote tweeted the post on to her account, writing, \u201cOmg we need a new emoji for whatever I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nThe pair also share a celebrity fan: Reese Witherspoon. The Oscar-winning star called Rippon \u201cReason #1\u201d to watch the Olympics, just before the Games kicked off last week. Rippon playfully noted that \u201cI want to make Reese Wtherspoon proud\u201d in an interview after his skate. She responded Monday morning to confirm that he indeed makes her \u201cso proud.\u201d\n\nOh @Adaripp ,you make me so proud ! Keep making us all so happy! https://t.co/XXzaXDpUAG \u2014 Reese Witherspoon (@RWitherspoon) February 12, 2018\n\nThe actress also traded tweets with Nagasu after the skater landed her history-making jump Sunday night, calling her \u201cMY hero !!\u201d after Nagasu noted that she watched the Witherspoon flick Home Again on the way to the Olympics. \u201cI know it\u2019s a movie but I wished you were my mom. You\u2019re my hero.\u201d\n\nThe friends appear to have been enjoying their Olympics stint from the start. Just before Team USA marched out into the PyeongChang Olympic Stadium, Rippon was shown planting a kiss on Nagasu\u2019s cheek in a Snapchat video.\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics are airing live on NBC.
