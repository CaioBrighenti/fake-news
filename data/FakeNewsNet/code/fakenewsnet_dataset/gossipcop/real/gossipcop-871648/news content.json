There will be 15 half-hour episodes total, and each will correspond with one of the houses featured on Fixer Upper season five.\n\nRELATED: 16 Goofy, Sweet and So-Chip-and-Jo Moments We\u2019re Going to Miss Now that Fixer Upper Is Ending\n\nImage zoom Joanna Gaines/Instagram\n\nOff screen, the couple has big plans for expanding their vast home improvement empire.

I believe it starts by simply going with your gut and telling your story.\u201d She adds, \u201cI unpack many different looks and styles in this book and give a deeper look into the design process and where to start with your space.\u201d\n\nWATCH THIS: PEOPLE Exclusive!
