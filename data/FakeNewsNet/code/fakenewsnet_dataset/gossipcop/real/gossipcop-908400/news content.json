Add Interest\n\nDespite all her previous accolades, the first-time Oscar nominee -- who\u2019s up for best supporting actress for her role in \"Lady Bird\" -- said she never imagined she\u2019d be recognized by the Academy in this way.\n\n\"Just to be in the room is incredible,\" Metcalf, 62, told ABC Radio. \"I just hadn\u2019t planned on it ever happening to me.\"\n\nThe actress, who became a household name through \"Roseanne,\" will star alongside original cast members Roseanne Barr and John Goodman when the show returns in March.\n\nScott Rudin Productions\n\nAside from the highly anticipated reboot of \"Roseanne,\" and the recognition from her peers for her work in \"Lady Bird,\" Metcalf said there's something else that really tops it all. She said that she enjoys hearing the reactions from \"Lady Bird\" fans who relate to the relationship between her character Marion and her free-spirited daughter Lady Bird, played by Saoirse Ronan.\n\n\"That\u2019s been wonderful to have mothers and daughters come up and say they've seen the movie together and they've had an epiphany throughout it, you know, seeing each other through different eyes,\" she said.\n\nThe movie also resonated in Metcalf's own household when she watched the film with her teenage daughter.\n\n\"My older daughter and I had the side-eye glances at each other throughout the movie because she's heard me say and she has said [things], if not verbatim, but very close to some of the lines that are in the movie,\" she said with a laugh.\n\n\"Lady Bird\" scored five Oscar nominations in total, including best picture, best actress for Saoirse Ronan and best director for Greta Gerwig.\n\nAdam Rose/ABC via Getty Images\n\nMetcalf will back on the small screen when \"Roseanne\" returns to ABC on March 27.\n\nThe 90th Annual Academy Awards airs live on ABC Sunday night starting at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/roseanne-gty-001-jpo-180228_3x2_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_12x5_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-ht-jpo-180228_23x13_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Andrea Tuccillo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned-53413916", "title": "'Lady Bird' actress Laurie Metcalf on Oscar nomination: 'I just hadn\u2019t planned on it ever happening to me'", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Oscars, Academy Awards, Lady Bird, Laurie Metcalf, Oscar nomination ,good morning america, morning news, robin roberts, lara spencer, josh eliott, sam champion, gma", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "'Lady Bird' star discusses her first Oscar nomination", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "'Lady Bird' star discusses her first Oscar nomination", "description": "\"Lady Bird\" star Laurie Metcalf never planned on getting an Oscar nomination.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "Oscars, Academy Awards, Lady Bird, Laurie Metcalf, Oscar nomination", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "'Lady Bird' star discusses her first Oscar nomination", "description": "\"Lady Bird\" star Laurie Metcalf never planned on getting an Oscar nomination.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,53413916", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,53413916", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,53413916", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,53413916", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
