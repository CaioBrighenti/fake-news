News, Parrish \u2014who is pregnant with Hart\u2019s third child\u2014has accepted her husband\u2019s apology and plans to move forward with him as a couple.\n\n\u201cEniko is aware of what\u2019s going on and that Kevin is not perfect,\u201d a source told the site.\n\n\u201cShe has accepted his apology and is focused on her pregnancy and what\u2019s to come. She has no plans for divorce. She believes Kevin is a good husband and always comes home to her.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cShe is bothered that these stories find their way into the press and that people are asking her about it. But she does her best to ignore it all and move forward. She listens to her husband and is not going to get stressed out. She is supporting him and standing by him.\u201d\n\nGirl, if you like it, we love it!\n\nSince the Ride Along star gave his public apology, the couple has been seen out with Parrish rocking her engagement ring, seeming unbothered. The two even had lunch this week:\n\nAs we previously reported, the comedian took to social media on Saturday to \u201cpublicly and profusely\u201d say \u201csorry\u201d to Parrish and his kids, Heaven Hart and Hendix Hart from a previous marriage, for past \u201cbad\u201d behavior.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at a place in my life where I feel like I have a target on my back and I should make smart decisions and recently I didn\u2019t,\u201d said the actor.\n\n\u201cI made a bad error in judgement and put myself in an environment where only bad things can happen and they did,\u201d he confessed.\n\n\u201cAnd doing that I know that I am going to hurt the people closest to, whom I have talked to\u2014my wife and my kids.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, law enforcement sources said the suspect contacted the Ride Along star\u2019s reps and demanded up to $10 million dollars to keep the footage under wraps. Sources also told the gossip site that the extortionist is either the woman shown in the video or someone who got a hold of the iPhone that recorded the tryst.\n\nIn addition, the FBI also knows the name of the woman in the videos, however none of the sources will say if Hart is actually the man featured in this particular footage.\n\nAs we wrote earlier, sources who have seen the videos told TMZ there are several clips of the following:\n\nA woman and Kevin in a club getting cozy. The tape then cuts to a bed, where you hear creaking of what could be sex.\n\nSecond clip where you don\u2019t see Kevin.\n\nThe 3rd clip shows 2 people milling around a room, one of them looks vaguely like Kevin.\n\nApparently this person didn\u2019t care: She was on a mission to expose the actor as a \u201cliar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real reason Kevin Hart orchestrated the Texas Hurricane Relief Fund, this so-called good deed was done to get ahead as he knew this damaging footage was one click away from being exposed as the liar and cheater he is,\u201d the woman recently told TMZ.\n\nShe added: \u201cKevin Hart was privy to me wanting to expose him as I have made countless attempts to expose this information to various blogs, in an attempt to also get paid.\u201d\n\nHart\u2019s rep released the following statement to E! News: \u201cSomeone tried to set Kevin up in a failed extortion attempt. As law enforcement is involved, we cannot comment further as it could affect the investigation.\u201d\n\nNo comment.\n\nRELATED NEWS:\n\nTorrei Hart Speaks Out: \u2018I Have An Ex-Husband Who Has Repeatedly Used Me In His Stand Up Routine\u2019\n\nUPDATE: FBI Identifies Suspect In Kevin Hart\u2019s Extortion Sex Scandal\n\nShady Boots!
