It was simple, it was straightforward, it was scandalous. It was \u201a\u00c4\u00faThe Thong Song,\u201a\u00c4\u011a and it was recently ranked by Billboard as having the 84th greatest chorus of the 21st Century.\n\nStill, two decades of enduring greatness does not mean a refresher isn't in order. Fashions change, and so do the sounds of summer. Norwegian trio JCY is just the group to bring a little modern heat to a classic. The tropical house update was blessed by Sisqo himself with the track with fresh vocals.\n\nIt's just as beachy keen as the original -- and even better for your summer time pool party DJ sets. Drop this on the crowd and watch the ladies lose it.\u00ac\u2020", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/879509920/?value=1.00&currency_code=USD&label=wh8cCLa922cQoIOxowM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/dj-khaled-bb14-cov-s8ask-aj-2017-billboard-400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/Sisqo-Thong-Song-screenshot-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1554285401541797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nw8g2&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://www.billboard.com/files/media/Sisqo-Thong-Song-screenshot-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://www.billboard.com/static/frontend/2017_05_23_1734/assets/images/Billboard-white.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/dj-khaled-bb14-cov-s8ask-aj-2017-billboard-400.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117im_/http://www.billboard.com/files/media/Sisqo-Thong-Song-screenshot-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kat Bein"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170613190117/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/dance/7825665/sisqo-the-thong-song-jcy-remix", "title": "Sisqo's 'The Thong Song' Gets Tropical Update From JCY: Listen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Sisqo's 'The Thong Song' Gets JCY Remake", "description": "Fashions change, and so do the sounds of summer.
