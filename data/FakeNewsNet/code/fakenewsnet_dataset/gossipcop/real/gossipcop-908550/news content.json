Little did the \u201cFilthy\u201d singer know the fire that was about to come his way, from Dylan Farrow.\n\nIt all started when Justin tweeted, \u201cCan someone please explain the saying, \u2018You just want your cake and to eat it too.\u2019 What else am I about to do with cake??\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJustin Timberlake probably didn\u2019t expect Dylan Farrow\u2019s reaction to this tweet.

You can\u2019t retain your credibility as an activist (i.e. \u2013 retain the cake) and, at the same time, praise a sexual predator (i.e. \u2013 eating the cake).\u201d\n\nThe saying means, for example, you can\u2019t support #TIMESUP and praise sexual predators at the same time. You can\u2019t retain your credibility as an activist (i.e. \u2013 retain the cake) and, at the same time, praise a sexual predator (i.e. \u2013 eating the cake). \u2014 Dylan Farrow (@RealDylanFarrow) January 23, 2018\n\nDylan, 32, is Woody Allen\u2019s adopted daughter with Mia Farrow, and she has alleged for decades that the director sexually assaulted her in 1992, when she was 7. (Allen has denied the claims.) Dylan has been back in the headlines. Just last week, she gave her first on-camera interview to CBS This Morning, giving details of the alleged molestation.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI loved my father. I respected him. He was my hero. And that doesn\u2019t obviously take away from what he did,\u201d she told Gayle King. \u201cBut it does make the betrayal and the hurt that much more intense.\u201d\n\nTimberlake recently worked with Allen on the film Wonder Wheel, and he has praised the Oscar-winning filmmaker even after the allegations resurfaced. The singer/actor came in for flak for wearing a Time\u2019s Up pin to the Golden Globes but refusing to denounce Allen.\n\nGreta Gerwig, Colin Firth, Mira Sorvino, and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet are just some of the actors to star in Allen films who have come forward recently to condemn the director, saying that they would not work with him again.\n\nTimberlake has yet to respond to Farrow\u2019s tweet.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qCQgMFt12GIRBw79t.E6sA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTgwO2g9ODA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YmiqP1TqEcZKlN5.51G8_w--~B/YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-10-19/0f61e620-b4f9-11e7-a288-0181d82e80f8_Pic-1-.jpg", "https://app.appsflyer.com/id286058814?pid=SmartBanner&c=US_Internal_YMktg_iOSSmartbanner_assortedpages_&af_sub1=Internal&af_sub2=US_YMktg&af_sub3=&af_sub4=&af_sub5=smartbanner__Banner_", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/icons/yahoo-logo.svg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KeN52qNKNDJa4.HP9KA3mg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTM0NC42MTUzODQ2MTUzODQ2NA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1v6TnGBf12FuJIu94ksewA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/3f32621efc0df6d3d3a6180c6e009445", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wzwEpA_F5HkUwdPebWTcvw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QJqQqo7utA_3ZmAv3tGhyg--~B/aD02ODk7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://78.media.tumblr.com/4888ad23d14ab967bc16d129cae683e2/tumblr_inline_p31a5whuZE1tusccv_1280.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wzwEpA_F5HkUwdPebWTcvw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02ODkuMDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QJqQqo7utA_3ZmAv3tGhyg--~B/aD02ODk7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://78.media.tumblr.com/4888ad23d14ab967bc16d129cae683e2/tumblr_inline_p31a5whuZE1tusccv_1280.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/dylan-farrow-drags-justin-timberlake-twitter-times-001746314.html", "title": "Dylan Farrow slams Justin Timberlake on Twitter over Time's Up", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/presentation/images/icons/win8-tile-1484740.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@Yahoo", "player": {"identifier": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle-news/dylan-farrow-slams-justin-timberlake-211523762.html?format=embed&region=US&lang=en-US&site=lifestyle&player_autoplay=true", "width": 500, "height": 281}, "card": "player", "description": "When Justin Timberlake casually asked his followers about the phrase, &quot;You can&apos;t have your cake and eat it too,&quot;
