(Published Tuesday, May 29, 2018)\n\nThe now-defunct \"Roseanne\" reboot has received one 2018 Emmy nomination, for one actress: No, not that one. Laurie Metcalf.\n\nThe 63-year-old actress, who reprised her role as Roseanne Connor's sister Jackie, was nominated Thursday for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance on the recent first, and last, season of the rebooted series.\n\nMetcalf's nomination comes just a month and a half after ABC canceled plans to produce a second season and cut off ties with main star Roseanne Barr after she posted an offensive tweet deemed to be racist.\n\nThis marks the 11th Emmy nomination for Metcalf, who previously won three for her role on the original \"Roseanne\" sitcom in the '90s. This year she is competing against actresses Megan Mullaly (\"Will & Grace\"), Zazie Beetz (\"Atlanta\"), Alex Borstein (\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\"), Betty Gilpin (\"GLOW\"), and \"Saturday Night Live\" stars Aidy Bryant, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones.\n\n2018 Emmy Nominations Snubs and Surprises: The Good, the Bad, the Huh?\n\nEarlier this year, Metcalf received two other prestigious honors: her first Oscar nomination, for her role in \"Lady Bird,\" and her second Tony Award, for her performances in a revival of Edward Albee's \"Three Tall Women.\"\n\nMetcalf will soon reprise her Roseanne role in a new spinoff titled \"The Connors,\" which will not involve Barr.\n\nOriginal Post: Laurie Metcalf Is the Only Roseanne Cast Member to Earn a 2018 Emmy Nod\n\n\u00a9 Copyright E!
