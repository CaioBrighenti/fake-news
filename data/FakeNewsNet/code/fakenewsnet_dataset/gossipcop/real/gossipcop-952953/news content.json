Hosted by race car driver Danica Patrick, the annual fete devoted to all things sports was held at the Microsoft Theater in L.A. on Wednesday, July 18, and you can bet the stars brought their fashion A-game on the red carpet.\n\nTrading their jerseys and uniforms for some super cool dresses, nominees like Olympic gold medalists Chloe Kim and Aly Raisman mingled with Hollywood heavyweights like Ciara, Kate Beckinsale and Jennifer Garner for a night that was full of plenty of adulation and even a few tear-jerking moments. But, let\u2019s be honest, we were just as excited to see what everyone in attendance was wearing.\n\nFrom Allison Janney\u2019s sparkly midi to Jessica Szohr\u2019s plunging blue design, there was no shortage of fierce fashion.
