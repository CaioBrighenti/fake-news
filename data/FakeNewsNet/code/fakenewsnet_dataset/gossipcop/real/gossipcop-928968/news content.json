Variety reports that ABC has just renewed its functionally unkillable medical drama Grey\u2019s Anatomy for a landmark 15th season, officially making the show the network\u2019s longest-running primetime drama series ever.\n\nStill starring Ellen Pompeo as Meredith Grey, a woman who has seen some serious shit by this point, the show remains one of ABC\u2019s highest-rated offerings despite its advancing years. Hence, presumably, why the network continues to renew the series, even after creator Rhimes announced last year that she was jumping ship to start developing shows for Netflix. (Rhimes will continue to serve as a producer on Grey\u2019s and her other ABC shows for as long as they continue to run, although it\u2019s worth noting that Krista Vernnoff is the series\u2019 actual showrunner.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrey\u2019s recently aired its 300th episode, planting it firmly in Gunsmoke, ER, and Law & Order territory when it comes to mainstream longevity in TV.", "images": ["https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=5zq9nmk&ct=0:ngtk7da&fmt=3", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--FNcsf4da--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/ljalmmqg3kutifheyvgv.jpg", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/activity;dc_iu=/4246/DFP_Audience_Pixel;dc_seg=22540930;blog=avnews;ord=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6770184&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--BcwoE7Zv--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/zt0s6xt2dqmkv9uje5aa.jpg", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--0g1Fc10y--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/zt0s6xt2dqmkv9uje5aa.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--BcwoE7Zv--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/zt0s6xt2dqmkv9uje5aa.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["William Hughes"], "canonical_link": "https://news.avclub.com/greys-anatomy-renewed-for-season-15-becoming-abcs-long-1825444511", "title": "Grey's Anatomy renewed for season 15, becoming ABC's longest-running primetime drama series ever", "meta_data": {"dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-edd40da2ae92de7cb0979025edd33027.css", "google-site-verification": "P13oAn8o8LB6FVCJWKsHWXvxfbR-SJrmvox6EgULpUs", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--7zdLcgzi--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/yfomencyqsnsfvqlfhnt.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--2rAgV5LF--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/yfomencyqsnsfvqlfhnt.png", "keywords": "TV, ABC, Grey's Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes, News", "news_keywords": "TV, ABC, Grey's Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes, News", "twitter": {"url": "https://news.avclub.com/greys-anatomy-renewed-for-season-15-becoming-abcs-long-1825444511", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--BcwoE7Zv--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/zt0s6xt2dqmkv9uje5aa.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@AV_Newswire", "title": "Grey's Anatomy renewed for season 15, becoming ABC's longest-running primetime drama series ever", "description": "While Scandals may blow over, co-stars may die, and even living content well Shonda Rhimes might depart for richer, more digital pastures, the core crew at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital continues to soldier on.
