Nikki Reed, who\u2019s expecting her first child, channeled Kim Kardashian\u2019s maternity style on a date night with husband Ian Somerhalder in L.A. on Saturday, May 27.\n\nNikki Reed Fashion Style\n\nNikki Reed showcased a daring and chic maternity look while out to dinner with husband Ian Somerhalder and a friend Saturday.\n\nThe Twilight alum, 29, wore a long, fitted black lace-up dress with a plunging neckline topped with a long black coat as she and her husband were joined by a friend for dinner.\n\nReed, who announced more than three weeks ago that she is pregnant with her first child, has rarely been spotted out in public in recent months.\n\nShe was last photographed in mid-May, grabbing a meal at the M Cafe in Los Angeles. At the time, she wore a long navy blue dress with a draped waist, paired with dark boots.\n\nThe couple, who married in 2015, announced that they were expecting a baby with a sweet Instagram post on May 4.\n\nThe Vampire Diaries star, 38, was pictured kissing his wife\u2019s baby bump in the beautiful photo. \u201cTo our friends, family, and rest of the world. In my 38 years on this earth I\u2019ve never experienced anything more powerful and beautiful than this,\u201d he captioned the pic. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more exciting than this next chapter and we wanted you to hear this from us first. This has been the most special time of our lives and we wanted to keep it between the three of us for as long as possible so we could enjoy this time with each other and our little one who is growing so fast\u2026because that\u2019s what they do, they grow so fast. Thank you for your kind energy. Love, Ian.\u201d\n\nThe actress also shared the photo on her Instagram account, along with a message to her unborn child. \u201cHi, Little One. I know you, but only because I feel you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHow is it possible to love someone so much already? All I know for sure is it\u2019s the strongest feeling I\u2019ve ever felt. We\u2019ve been sharing this body for quite some time, and we\u2019ve already experienced so much together. We can\u2019t wait to meet you\u2026 Love, Your parents.\u201d\n\nAs it is known that the couple \u201creally wanted a baby,\u201d according to an insider.\n\n\u201cNikki said she always knew she wanted to have kids before she turned 30,\u201d the insider told Us earlier this month.\n\nShe appears to have taken a fashion tip from the mother of two Kardashian, 36, whose maternity style when she was pregnant with son Saint, 17 months, consisted of fitted dresses topped with matching coats. The reality TV star said in a post on her website in 2015 that she was not trying to hide her bump, but wanted to accentuate it, while disguising other things.\n\n\u201cYes, long coats to cover my fat arms and ass,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s such a trip how your body grows and changes, and at the end of the day, you have to wear what you are comfortable in and what you feel good in.\u201d\n\nSince then, Kardashian\u2019s pregnancy style has been adopted by celebs including Chrissy Teigen, Blac Chyna, Emily Blunt and Kristin Cavallari.\n\nShort Bio on Nikki Reed and Ian Somerhalder:\n\nNikki Reed is an American actress, screenwriter, singer-songwriter, and model.
