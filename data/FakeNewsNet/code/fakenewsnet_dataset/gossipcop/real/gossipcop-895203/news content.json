A Gatorade spokesperson e-mailed AdGage saying:\n\nWhile Serena intended to have Olympia make her screen debut as part of this film, her daughter was under the weather and unable to be on set, but the sentiment remains the same.\n\nAlthough fans may be disappointed to learn that it wasn\u2019t actually Serena\u2019s daughter, the ad has an inspirational message. In the video above, the tennis star shares all the lessons she learned from sports, including strengths and goals.", "images": ["http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2pac-madonna-love-letter-auction.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-10.23.03-PM.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_twitter_online_social_media_734367.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_instagram_online_social_media_photo_734395.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jermaine-Dupri-on-Current-State-of-Female-Rap-Its-Like-Strippers-Rapping.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/source-logo_red_120x26px.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Don-Cheadle-Reportedly-Joins-Space-Jam-2-Cast.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10321959f.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lil-Wayne005.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/11183302536_fe67fbb8e7_b.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/if_online_social_media_facebook_734386.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-11.30.40-PM.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-4.24.45-PM.png", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Cardi-B-on-Jermaine-Dupris-Strippers-Rapping-Comment-It-Seems-Like-Thats-What-People-Wanna-Hear.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/10144111n.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toni-Braxton-Testifies-Against-Man-Who-Stole-her-1M-Engagement-Ring.jpg", "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/disney-the-lion-king-asos-design-capsule-collection.png"], "top_img": "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-4.24.45-PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://thesource.com/2017/11/20/serena-williams-daughter-played-stunt-double-gatorade-commercial/", "title": "Serena Williams' Daughter Was Played by a Stunt Double in Gatorade Commercial", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Serena Williams' daughter didn't make her TV debut yet.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Serena Williams' Daughter Was Played by a Stunt Double in Gatorade Commercial", "description": "Serena Williams' daughter didn't make her TV debut yet.", "url": "http://thesource.com/2017/11/20/serena-williams-daughter-played-stunt-double-gatorade-commercial/", "site_name": "The Source", "image": {"identifier": "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-4.24.45-PM.png", "width": 599, "height": 537, "alt": "Serena Williams' Daughter Was Played by a Stunt Double in Gatorade Commercial"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheSourceMagazine/", "tag": "serena williams", "section": "feature", "published_time": "2017-11-20T21:30:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Serena Williams' daughter didn't make her TV debut yet.", "title": "Serena Williams' Daughter Was Played by a Stunt Double in Gatorade Commercial", "site": "@TheSource", "image": "http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-4.24.45-PM.png", "creator": "@miss2bees"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.10"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511154000.0, "source": "http://thesource.com", "summary": ""}
