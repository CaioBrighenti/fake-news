her latest music video.\n\nFormer Spice Girl Mel C will be joined by three of her former bandmates in her latest music video.\n\nThe near-reunion takes place in the singer\u2019s crowdsourced visuals for Room For Love which features cameos from Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner.\n\nOnly Mel B is missing from the video which brings together crowd footage of Mel C and montages of fans and stars performing into their phones and cameras from across the world.\n\nBeckham \u2013 who reportedly scuppered a full Spice Girls reunion last year \u2013 is shown making a love heart with her hands while Bunton sings along to the track.\n\nMel C, full name Melanie Chisholm, told the Press Association it was a \u201cshame\u201d her namesake could not make it a full line-up.\n\nThe 43-year-old said: \u201cI don\u2019t want it to look negative because it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not a big deal, I reached out to lots of other people and everyone\u2019s busy.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t get round to doing it and obviously it does concern me\u2026 I think people will pick up on that but I don\u2019t want anything to be made of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving four of the Spice Girls in it is really special,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cGeri\u2019s in there briefly, Emma\u2019s done a really lovely one and last but not least Victoria Beckham found time to do a little one for me.\u201d\n\nNatalie Imbruglia and KT Tunstall also appear in the video which Mel C said she was inspired to create after performing to an energetic crowd in Brazil.\n\nThe singer said there were no plans for a full Spice Girls reunion \u201cin the pipeline\u201d after she rejected the chance to join Horner, Bunton and Mel B in a 20th anniversary celebration of Wannabe last summer.\n\nShe said performing as a four-piece would not have done \u201cthe band or fans justice\u201d after Beckham opted against joining the comeback.\n\nBut she added: \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like it was right and so if everyone was feeling it at some point, I\u2019m not against the idea.\n\n\u201cBut I think it would have to be all five really.\u201d\n\nPA Media", "images":
