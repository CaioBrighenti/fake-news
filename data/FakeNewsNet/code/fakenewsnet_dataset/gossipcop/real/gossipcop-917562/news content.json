That doesn't change when you're going through a rough breakup, either\u2014just ask Jennifer Lawrence. In a recent appearance on Watch What Happens Live, J.Law described the hilarious way that her friend cheered her up when she called it quits with Darren Aronofsky.\n\n\u201cWhen Darren and I first broke up. I told [Schumer] and I was really sad,\u201d the 27-year-old actress said. \u201cThe next day I got a bouquet of flowers delivered and I said, \u2018What is this?\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cI bring the bouquet of flowers in and there was a note that says, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry to hear you\u2019re gonna die alone. Love, Amy.'\u201d\n\nLawrence and Aronofsky, 49, began dating after the production of mother!, which he wrote and directed. They later broke up, after a year together, but it seems the two are still close. About a month after they ended their relationship, Lawrence and Aronofsky were seen taking a (friendly) walk in New York City.\n\nLawrence clearly wasn't offended by Schumer's joke considering she was at her friend and soon-to-be fictional sister's wedding. \"It was beautiful,\" Lawrence said about the event. \"It was very sudden, but it was...I was sobbing the whole\u2014his vows were stunning. It's when two people really love each other and they really mean it, it shows, and it was a beautiful ceremony and an amazing time. I couldn't be happier for them.\"\n\nRelated: Amy Schumer's New Comedy 'I Feel Pretty' Looks Like the Pick-Me-Up We All Need", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d971f11040d8257aedec62/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/pne%2520day.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a99680599ea9a2ba3431b31/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amy-schumer-said-jennifer-lawrence-was-going-to-die-alone-after-breakup-with-darren-aronofsky.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ca4e5c1053aa86e1b7bb6e2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/this-is-us.JPG", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a99680599ea9a2ba3431b31/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/amy-schumer-said-jennifer-lawrence-was-going-to-die-alone-after-breakup-with-darren-aronofsky.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02a69e0cd0cf17c7e295cb/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1147368581.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d07870494f64b6e9de3c018/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-77929564.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5cffa4c3b1802a3b33653d53/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1131968445.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d051443daf4bd31058a1f84/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1155989173.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a99680599ea9a2ba3431b31/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amy-schumer-said-jennifer-lawrence-was-going-to-die-alone-after-breakup-with-darren-aronofsky.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Anna Moeslein", "Christopher Rosa", "Jessica Radloff", "Melissa Minto", "Julyssa Lopez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/amy-schumer-jennifer-lawrence-breakup-flowers", "title": "Amy Schumer Gave Jennifer Lawrence the Absolute Worst Breakup Gift", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "When Jennifer Lawrence told best friend Amy Schumer that she was sad after a breakup, Schumer sent flowers with a hilariously dark message.", "keywords": "snd,Jennifer Lawrence,Amy Schumer,Darren Aronofsky", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a99680599ea9a2ba3431b31/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amy-schumer-said-jennifer-lawrence-was-going-to-die-alone-after-breakup-with-darren-aronofsky.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Amy Schumer Gave Jennifer Lawrence the Absolute Worst Breakup Gift", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/amy-schumer-jennifer-lawrence-breakup-flowers"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a99680599ea9a2ba3431b31/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amy-schumer-said-jennifer-lawrence-was-going-to-die-alone-after-breakup-with-darren-aronofsky.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Amy Schumer Gave Jennifer Lawrence the Absolute Worst Breakup Gift"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
