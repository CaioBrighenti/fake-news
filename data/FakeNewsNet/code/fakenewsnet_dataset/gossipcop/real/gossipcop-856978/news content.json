She attended school in the southern part of California. Soon after she was done with her college, she joined the real estate scene where she met her co-host, ex-husband and husband, who is none other than Tarek El Moussa. As of 2018, Christina El Moussa\u2019s net worth is $4 million.\n\nSoon, the couple opened their own real estate agency: Tarek and Christina: The El Moussa Group. After their split, the agency is now Tarek and Associates with only Tarek El Moussa involved in it. Their real estate business began to suffer losses when the real estate market crashed in October 2008. This affected their lifestyle, as they progressively moved from a $6000 house to a $700 apartment complex.\n\nTheir lives changed when a friend of the couple helped them film the process of flipping a house from the start to finish. They sent it to various production houses, but not many people thought that the viewers wouldn\u2019t be interested in the video. The Pie Town Productions differently, liked the video that they had made. Then HGTV\u2019s producers noticed the Instagram profiles of the real estate couple. They found it very interesting because the profile featured many images of house before and after renovation.\n\nThe El Moussa couple\u2019s lives changed after HGTV, in 2012 signed them up for a weekly show that basically showed the process of buying a distressed property and then renovating it right until the finishing touches. The episode also explained what could and did go wrong with the property and its renovation process. Finally, in 2013, HGTV began broadcasting the weekly show \u201cFlip or Flop\u201d. Christina El Moussa has been the co-star on 87 Flip or Flop episodes. Though the rumor mill was churning about the 7th season of the show getting canceled because of the El Moussa couple\u2019s divorce, they confirmed that the 7th season will be aired since both the parties had agreed to co-star with each other.", "images": ["https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-final_favicon-1-192x192.jpg", "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christina-el-moussa-970x500.jpg", "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/log_trans_jp.jpg", "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/martin_freeman_-_getty_-_h_2018.jpg?w=224&h=350  ", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ff8ce7fb150c79985b3d5a920d259cf6?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D24&r=G", "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/melisa.jpg?w=224&h=350  ", "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Saoirse-Ronan-critics-choice-jan-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=224&h=350  ", "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/themes/gridlove-child/close-icon-white.png", "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/luke-perry-portrait-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=224&h=350  ", "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christina-el-moussa.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xcdy-Bm7-BYUc.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christina-el-moussa.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Team Cinemaholic"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/christina-el-moussa-net-worth/", "title": "Christina El Moussa Net Worth 2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Christina El Moussa Net Worth 2019 | How Much is Christina Worth?", "description": "How much is Christina El Moussa worth?\u00a0$6 Million How did Christina El Moussa earn her money and wealth?
