Jennifer Garner wasn\u2019t exactly fond of Ben Affleck\u2018s last girlfriend (Shauna Sexton), and now he\u2019s not a fan of her new man. A source tells In Touch magazine that even though Cali Burger CEO John Miller is the \u201cnicest guy,\u201d Ben can\u2019t help but not like him.\n\n\u201cBen is used to his ex-wife dropping everything for him, but that\u2019s all changed and he\u2019s no longer at the top of her list of priorities,\u201d an insider tells the mag, on newsstands now. Apparently, the Gone Girl actor is also a tad jealous. \u201cHe winces whenever Jen brings up John\u2019s name. He can\u2019t help finding faults with him, even though John\u2019s the nicest guy and hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nJen was initially apprehensive about jumping back into the dating pool. Just last year, the 13 Going on 30 star said she didn\u2019t want to be set up on a date. She told reporters at the Hollywood Foreign Press Conference, \u201cI would not choose to be single or be in this position. It\u2019s something that we are working through. I haven\u2019t been on a date and I am not interested in dating. People want to set me up and I am just like, \u2018No, thank you!'\u201d\n\nWell, we\u2019re happy she took a chance because it sounds like she\u2019s living her best life. (Sorry, Ben!) A separate insider revealed to the outlet, \u201cJen trusts John. She didn\u2019t go into this romance lightly. She\u2019s realized that he\u2019s the guy for her. She knows some people think it\u2019s too soon, but now that their romance is no longer a secret, they want to be together 24/7.\u201d *Cue the awws*\n\nThey continued, \u201cAfter all that she\u2019s been through with Ben \u2014 the cheating, the addiction relapses, the public humiliation \u2014 her relationship with John is like a dream. Jen says that getting treated like a queen by John has taken some getting used to, but she\u2019s loving it.\u201d\n\nFor more on this story, pick up the latest issue of In Touch Weekly, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/John-Miller-pics.jpg?w=683&resize=683%2C1024", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Matt-Damon-Ben-Affleck-Los-Angeles-Promo.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ben-Affleck-Jennifer-Garner-Kids-Church-Promo.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ben-Affleck-winces-Jens-new-man.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Ben-Affleck-Hands-Full-With-Kids.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Celeb-Friends-Dated-Same-Person.jpg?resize=200%2C113", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ben-Affleck-winces-Jens-new-man.jpg?fit=200%2C112"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ben-Affleck-winces-Jens-new-man.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Heintz", "Dec"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/ben-affleck-winces-when-jennifer-garner-mentions-john-miller/", "title": "Ben Affleck 'Winces' When Jennifer Garner Mentions John Miller", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "#Awkward!
