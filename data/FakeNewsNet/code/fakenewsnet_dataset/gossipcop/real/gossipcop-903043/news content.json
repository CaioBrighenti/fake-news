It showed him vlogging from the \"suicide forest\" Aokigahara, famous for being the site of a disproportionate number of suicides. Qorygore found what he said was a dead body covered by a raincoat and included it in his video.\n\nThe video received nearly 600,000 views before YouTube removed it, according to the Indonesia-based publication Coconuts Jakarta.\n\n\"I went all the way to Japan. This is Logan Paul 2.0,\" he said in the video according to The Daily Dot.\n\nQorygore on his YouTube channel. Qorygore/YouTube\n\nYouTube star Logan Paul infamously pulled the same stunt in December 2017. He included a video of a dead body in the forest as part of a longer controversial vlog about Japan. YouTube ultimately punished Paul for the video, limiting his advertising revenue and removing him from a number of projects reserved for Youtube celebrities. Paul apologized for it.\n\nRead more: YouTube released a movie with Logan Paul less than a year after his infamous 'suicide forest' video.\n\nQoygore's video also received severe backlash in the YouTube comments and on Twitter.\n\nAfter YouTube removed Qorygore's video, the vlogger justified his actions in an interview with fellow YouTuber Eno Bening. He said he had a permit that allowed him to film dead bodies in the forest, and suggested the body may have been fake anyway.\n\n\"It was a pile covered by a raincoat like [a ghost]. Because I respected the dead body, I didn't get really close to him,\" he said, according to a translation from Coconuts Jakarta.\n\nIn another video published hours later, Qorygore clarified that he wasn't trying to be disrespectful. He said he only showed the raincoat instead of the body underneath it.\n\n\"Because I respected the dead body, I didn't get close to it.\" he said.\n\nMark Abadi contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c09941dbde70f6273792b70-750-563.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c09941dbde70f6273792b6f-2732-1366.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c09941dbde70f6273792b6f-2732-1366.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Shamsian"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/youtube-qorygore-suicide-forest-video-dead-body-japan-logan-paul-2018-12", "title": "Another YouTube star took a video of a dead body in a Japanese 'suicide forest'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-12-06", "sailthru.date": "2018-12-06", "news_keywords": "YouTube, trending news, Qorygore, Logan Paul, Japan, Suicide Forest, Suicide, Jacob Shamsian", "sailthru.tags": "YouTube, trending news, Qorygore, Logan Paul, Japan, Suicide Forest, Suicide, Jacob Shamsian", "description": "YouTube star Qorygore posted a video of a dead body in a Japanese suicide forest, less than a year after Logan Paul did the same thing.", "sailthru.description": "YouTube star Qorygore posted a video of a dead body in a Japanese suicide forest, less than a year after Logan Paul did the same thing.", "title": "Another YouTube star took a video of a dead body in a Japanese 'suicide forest'", "sailthru.verticals": "insider, news", "sailthru.title": "Another YouTube star took a video of a dead body in a Japanese 'suicide forest'", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c09941dbde70f6273792b6f-2732-1366.jpg", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c09941dbde70f6273792b6e-2732-2049.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c09941dbde70f6273792b6e-160-120.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "News", "sailthru.author": "Jacob Shamsian", "og": {"title": "Another YouTube star took a video of a dead body in a Japanese 'suicide forest'", "description": "YouTube star Qorygore posted a video of a dead body in a Japanese suicide forest, less than a year after Logan Paul did the same thing.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-qorygore-suicide-forest-video-dead-body-japan-logan-paul-2018-12", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c09941dbde70f6273792b6f-2732-1366.jpg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Jacob Shamsian, INSIDER", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-qorygore-suicide-forest-video-dead-body-japan-logan-paul-2018-12", "title": "Another YouTube star took a video of a dead body in a Japanese 'suicide forest'", "description": "YouTube star Qorygore posted a video of a dead body in a Japanese suicide forest, less than a year after Logan Paul did the same thing.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c09941dbde70f6273792b6f-2732-1366.jpg", "creator": "@JayShams", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "Another YouTube star took a video of a dead body in a Japanese 'suicide forest'": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544072400.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
