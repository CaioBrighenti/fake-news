It will mark the first time a man has graced the cover of the magazine without a woman by his side.\n\nBut perhaps more significantly the issue will also contain a pictorial and centerfold Playmate feature with its very first transgender model. And that honor will go to French model Ines Rau.\n\nAs People explained, 26-year-old Rau was photographed by Derek Kettela for the spread, in which she rocks a simple white bra and matching lace panties, along with sexy but understated white socks and sneakers.\n\nAnd while the Playmate title is new this isn\u2019t Rau\u2019s first time being photographed for the revered men\u2019s magazine. She previously appeared in its May 2014 A-Z Issue, in a spread titled \"Evolution.\" That spread, People explained, was all about celebrating the world\u2019s shifting acceptance of differing gender identities.\n\n\"It\u2019s how I celebrated my coming-out, actually,\" Rau told Playboy in an accompanying interview. \"I took that chance, and then I signed with an agency.\"\n\nAnd even for someone as strong and confident as Rau, living as her true self didn\u2019t come easily. As she told Playboy, \"I lived a long time without saying I was transgender. I dated a lot and almost forgot. I was scared of never finding a boyfriend and being seen as weird. Then I was like, You know, you should just be who you are. It\u2019s a salvation to speak the truth about yourself, whether it\u2019s your gender, sexuality, whatever. The people who reject you aren\u2019t worth it. It\u2019s not about being loved by others; it\u2019s about loving yourself.\"\n\nNow, as a model who has broken barriers in high fashion in campaigns for Balmain and in the pages of Vogue Italia, Rau is without question a woman worth taking advice from.\n\n\"The advice I have for girls is to chill,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t pressure yourself. Embrace yourself and be proud of who you are with your imperfections. It\u2019s all in the mind, you know?\"", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d971f11040d8257aedec62/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/pne%2520day.JPG", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_275%2Cq_80%2Cw_275/v1498574805/glamour_jazz-jennings-message-for-straight-boys.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1ccd5fea380e0008ea1ad1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/harry-meghan.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d110d367704655e16a1f922/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d02bfd00cd0cf5115e295cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-858131718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e8eec2a9993f07551d7014/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-491158718.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e8f08adbd21c41651e330d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-491158718ines1.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d086f396b45550f40f11e23/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/151890_0744.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d14df00342871000941102d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/charlies-angels-DF-28561_r.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e8f08adbd21c41651e330d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-491158718ines1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Anna Moeslein", "Christopher Rosa", "Stacey Leasc", "Samantha Leach"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/ines-rau-playboy-first-transgender-playmate", "title": "Meet Ines Rau, Playboy's First Transgender Playmate", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "French model Ines Rau, 26, is the first-ever transgender Playmate, marking an important milestone for iconic magazine which recently lost its founder.", "keywords": "transgender,playboy,naked", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "See the French model's centerfold, which is a major first for the iconic magazine.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e8f08adbd21c41651e330d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-491158718ines1.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Playboy Just Revealed Its First-Ever Transgender Playmate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/ines-rau-playboy-first-transgender-playmate"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "See the French model's centerfold, which is a major first for the iconic magazine.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e8f08adbd21c41651e330d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-491158718ines1.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Playboy Just Revealed Its First-Ever Transgender Playmate"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
