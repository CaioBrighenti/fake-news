The Dan Reynolds-fronted group woke up to news that their third studio effort is up for best pop vocal album alongside efforts from Coldplay, Lana Del Rey, Kesha and Ed Sheeran.\n\nTheir No. 3 Billboard Hot 100 hit \"Thunder\" landed in the best pop duo/group performance category in competition with The Chainsmokers and Coldplay's \"Something Just Like This,\" Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's \"Despacito,\" Portugal. The Man's \"Feel It Still\" and Zedd and Alessia Cara's \"Stay.\"\n\n\"Grammy nominations are one of those things you can never really predict, so we try not to think about them too much in advance,\" the band tells Billboard in an exclusive statement. \"But waking up this morning to see our nominations was an unbelievable surprise, especially in the company of such great artists. We started into this album cycle for Evolve feeling more centered and personally happy than we have in years -- to see the reaction to the album leading up to these nominations has only amplified our gratitude to be able to wake up and do what we love every day.\"\n\nThe nods are the third and fourth for the group, who took home a golden gramophone for best rock performance in 2014 for their breakthrough hit \"Radioactive,\" which was also nominated for record of the year.\n\nThe 60th Grammy Awards are set for Sunday, Jan. 28, airing live on CBS from Madison Square Garden in New York City.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/06-Imagine-Dragons-2017-cr-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/06-Imagine-Dragons-2017-cr-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/06-Imagine-Dragons-2017-cr-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gil Kaufman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8053806/imagine-dragons-2018-grammy-nominations-unbelievable-surprise-reaction", "title": "Imagine Dragons Call Grammy Nominations an 'Unbelievable Surprise'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Imagine Dragons Call Grammy Nominations an 'Unbelievable Surprise'", "description": "It was a good morning for Imagine Dragons, who woke up two Grammy nominations on Tuesday (Nov. 28).", "og": {"title": "Imagine Dragons Call Grammy Nominations an 'Unbelievable Surprise'", "description": "It was a good morning for Imagine Dragons, who woke up two Grammy nominations on Tuesday (Nov. 28).", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/06-Imagine-Dragons-2017-cr-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-1548.jpg", "width": 1548, "height": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8053806/imagine-dragons-2018-grammy-nominations-unbelievable-surprise-reaction", "site_name": "Billboard", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8053806/imagine-dragons-2018-grammy-nominations-unbelievable-surprise-reaction", "title": "Imagine Dragons Call Grammy Nominations an 'Unbelievable Surprise'", "description": "It was a good morning for Imagine Dragons, who woke up two Grammy nominations on Tuesday (Nov. 28).", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/06-Imagine-Dragons-2017-cr-Eliot-Lee-Hazel-1548.jpg", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
