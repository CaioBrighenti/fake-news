(It keeps getting better.)\n\nThe actress explained that she began to rely on the women during the grueling and uncomfortable process of promoting her Oscar-winning work in Room . \u201cI felt lonely and bad sometimes. I was embarrassed to keep talking about myself,\u201d she said.\n\nAn unexpected but \u201cbeautiful\u201d email from Stone and a text from Lawrence, turned into powerful relationships.\n\n\u201cThat [group of friends] saved my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI was able to talk with them about everything that was going on in my life, and it was with people who had been through it before and are also hilarious. That support and acceptance was everything. I was home-schooled, so I didn\u2019t have friends that had the same interests as me, and I found it to be absolutely incredible.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Larson has gushed about her celebrity comrades. After the 2017 Academy Awards, Larson posted a picture to Instagram of her embracing a tearful Stone. But the duo\u2019s cute Oscars behavior extends back even farther than this year. Larson revealed to Vanity Fair that last year, when she was nominated, Stone gave her a good luck card alongside a gift: the book I Can Fly .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s those little things,\u201d Larson said of Stone\u2019s gesture.\n\nLarson also opened up about getting to know Lawrence, whom she met through costar Woody Harrelson, who had likewise introduced Stone and Lawrence. Larson explained that she and Lawrence happened to be in Montreal at the same time, and hung out every week.\n\n\u201cWe just had a blast together, going to get dinner every Saturday night. It gave us all a chance to connect,\u201d Larson said.\n\nHarrelson also praised the group of actresses, calling them \u201ca very tight-knit group who keep them honest and keep their ego in check.\u201d\n\nAnd with Larson recently snagging the coveted titular role in Captain Marvel \u2014the first female-led Marvel superhero film\u2014it seems Larson will be needing those friends by her side more than ever. After all, every superhero needs her sidekicks.\n\nRead more about Larson's upcoming films and her friendships on vanityfair.com , and pick up the May issue on newsstands starting May 2.\n\nPinterest Inez and Vinoodh exclusively for Vanity Fair.\n\nRelated: Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence Became Friends in the Most Millennial Way\n\nBrie Larson Ran from Boulders at Her Indiana Jones Themed Birthday Party:", "images": ["https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58ff41e60c05f057f6126e4d/4:3/w_1536/brie-larson-friends.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/591a0f0e2006e2187de4708f/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Scarlett%20Johanson.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e93bee91855cce1346/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-579375228.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58ff41e60c05f057f6126e4d/2:1/w_790,c_limit/brie-larson-friends.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e40e7c3c52432b4019/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-141284566.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e43811d20203f3d323/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-108889218.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59908559a3fda3509c3412ed/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-668365186.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/5990855ba60c781bf9479496/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-682112688.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e13bee91855cce1344/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-72538840.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e2563d5e91502fcc59/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-84263845.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed771f3811d20203f3d327/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-51319784.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e53811d20203f3d324/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-158135909.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58ff41e6c18025126ab6b44c/master/w_320,c_limit/05%2520Brie%2520Larson%2520COVER.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f1897cc1eac746f6e754f/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Brad%20Pitt.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/591a0f0ebf330e0e94ab3980/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Selena%20Gomez.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e50e7c3c52432b401a/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-176802064.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59908564a3fda3509c3412ef/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-809322204%20(1).jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59908558215aa57f58934ae7/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-646525136.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e80e7c3c52432b401b/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-529492198.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e80158597c55a6c6ce/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-518319114.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e73811d20203f3d325/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-480787178.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59908555a3fda3509c3412eb/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-651199134.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e3c12b2409254de1a5/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-105501272.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59908576a60c781bf9479498/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-828844088.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76eb3811d20203f3d326/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-600973056.jpg", "https://www.wmagazine.com/images/w_logo.svg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76e73bee91855cce1345/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-492593868.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58b379b1c200102b9e472d3a/master/h_320,c_limit/Brie%20Larson.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/57ed76ea0158597c55a6c6cf/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-579454480.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/59908558215aa57f58934ae9/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-678249062.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58ff41e60c05f057f6126e4d/2:1/w_790,c_limit/brie-larson-friends.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Neha Prakash", "Composite.
