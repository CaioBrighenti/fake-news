Kelly Ripa celebrated two big anniversaries on Tuesday, May 1. First off, she rang in 22 years of marriage with her husband, Mark Consuelos. On top of that, the day marked one year of her hosting Live With Kelly with co-host Ryan Seacrest!\n\nThe TV personality took to Instagram to give sweet shout-outs to both Mark and Ryan. For Mark, she posted a sweet video collage featuring a bunch of cute photos of the two. \u201cFeliz Aniversario lover! 22 years.

No matter what, we support each other in everything we do.\u201d\n\nKelly also had a sweet message for Ryan, who joined her on the morning talk show after her former co-host Michael Strahan abruptly left her. \u201cProving time flies when you\u2019re having fun, a year goes by in the blink of an eye!
