Until he didn\u2019t.\n\nJohn Goodman\u2019s character, it was revealed by Roseanne in the last season\u2019s closing minutes in 1997, had really died at his daughter\u2019s wedding. The audience spent 24 episodes believing he pulled through. Roseanne\u2019s narration explained she constructed a fantasy to cope.\n\nIt was one of the most divisive moments in recent television history when the show ended, but in this year\u2019s short-lived revival, Dan was very much alive after the show opened with a self-aware joke about the controversy.\n\nNow, following Roseanne Barr\u2019s racist Twitter rant in May that prompted ABC to cancel the revival mid-season and spin off the series in \u201cThe Conners,\u201d Goodman has said how the show will address the matriarch\u2019s absence.\n\nShe\u2019s dead, Goodman explained.\n\nAnd this death might finally stick.\n\n\u201cI guess he\u2019ll be mopey and sad because his wife\u2019s dead,\u201d Goodman said of his blue-collar-hero character Dan in an interview with the Sunday Times.\n\nThe often media-shy Goodman opened up about Barr\u2019s controversial departure that drew reactions from President Trump, whom Barr supports.\n\nIn May, she made references to President Barack Obama\u2019s former adviser Valerie Jarrett and apes. Jarrett is black. The tweet in late May read: \u201cmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\u201d\n\n[NBC announced John McCain\u2019s death \u2014 then abruptly cut to men kissing in dolphin masks]\n\nABC canceled her show a day later, and President Channing Dungey called her tweet \u201cabhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\u201d Trump appeared to reference the cancellation days later, calling it a \u201cdouble standard\u201d for conservatives after comedian Samantha Bee made a vulgar comment about his daughter, Ivanka.\n\nBarr later apologized and blamed Ambien for her tweets. Her representative did not return a request for comment.\n\nBut months after the fallout, Goodman revealed a shock that still lingers. The popular show revitalized legendary characters dormant for two decades, and nearly as quickly as it came back, the show ended.\n\n\u201cI was surprised. I\u2019ll put it this way, I was surprised at the response,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. \u201cAnd that\u2019s probably all I should say about it.\u201d\n\nHe paused for a long moment and thought about all that came before. \u201cI know, I know, for a fact that she\u2019s not a racist,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new show, \u201cThe Conners,\u201d will premiere in October. It will feature the core Conner family, but Barr will have no financial or creative ties to the series, ABC has said.\n\nIt may be difficult for Barr to see her characters on screen without her control. \u201cRoseanne\u201d was one of the biggest shows of the 1990s, and it brought Barr commercial and critical acclaim with her depiction of a struggling working-class family.\n\nIn the closing minutes of the series finale, after she revealed that Dan had died and that she wielded the power of the characters\u2019 fate like a god, Roseanne wrote in her book that love is stronger than hate. But she also wrote more prescient words: \u201cI learned that no one can stop me but me.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nRoseanne Barr on her Valerie Jarrett tweet: \u2018I was so sad that people thought it was racist\u2019\n\nRoseanne Barr launched her new YouTube career by yelling an explanation for her Valerie Jarrett tweet", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9fyArfXpajLX0KEMjGAt0-4l7g4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PTAUMRTJFA3RBPTHGSPMQLEDCM.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/OsAtH-1XUhvh7UzAByTQh-5WRHg=/960x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ND3BJV66MZURHPJTN3UNKGLFY.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9fyArfXpajLX0KEMjGAt0-4l7g4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PTAUMRTJFA3RBPTHGSPMQLEDCM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "August", "Alex Horton Is A General Assignment Reporter For The Washington Post.
