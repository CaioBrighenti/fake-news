(Published Friday, July 17, 2015)\n\nIf you could ask your mother anything, what would you ask her?\n\nThat's just what Kate Hudson had the opportunity to do when she and her famous mom Goldie Hawn sat down for Interview magazine's May issue.\n\nIn the candid interview, the mother-daughter duo talked about everything from \"The First Wives Club\" star's wild past as a go-go dancer to the comedy icon's advice for younger actors and why she took a 15-year break from Hollywood.\n\nGoldie Hawn's Best Roles\n\n\"It's been 15 years since you've chosen to make a movie,\" Hudson asked. \"Why so long?\"\n\nHawn explained, \"Because I believe that life is about doing. It's about changing. It's about transitioning. I can't imagine, as a human being, not being able to grow.\"\n\nDo-Gooder Gallery\n\nThe 71-year-old explained hitting a milestone birthday made her look at her life differently.\n\n\"When I turned 50, I asked some of my girlfriends, all actresses of the same age, 'What are we going to do now?' I wanted to go live somewhere for a while, learn archaeology, or take part in healing the world on some level. I wanted to dig deep and say, 'Who am I now? What do I have to offer? What do I have to learn?'\"\n\nHawn also said that after 9/11 she realized what she wanted to do something more meaningful.\n\n\"I ended up writing two books and creating MindUP. It's now in Jordan, Serbia, the U.K., America, Canada, Hong Kong. I never looked back. I never wished to be acting again. I was so engaged,\" she said.\n\nBut that desire to stay away from the screen clearly faded.\n\nAfter a decade and a half away, the funny lady is back in full effect, starring alongside Amy Schumer in \"Snatched,\" due out in theaters on May 11.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright E!
