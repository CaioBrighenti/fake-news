Thanks to a savvy Instagram user, a snap of Johnson giving some side eye to Jolie (who was seated at her table) while Aniston was on stage went viral after the awards ceremony earlier this month.\n\n\u201cJennifer Aniston was on stage talking and then here\u2019s you and you\u2019re just staring at Angelina Jolie\u2019s reaction,\u201d Fallon accused as he presented the photo. \u201cBut so is Armie\u2019s (Hammer) wife,\u201d pointed out the 50 Shades Freed actress. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one!\u2026 I was trying to be sly about it.\u201d\n\nJohnson went on to explain she doesn\u2019t even think she was peeping at Jolie at all. \u201cTruthfully, I don\u2019t think I was really looking at her because if you look really closely at the angle of my eyes, they\u2019re kind of over here,\u201d she explained while demonstrating her gaze passing by Jolie. She then confessed she was probably looking at the table of the Stranger Things kids because she\u2019s a big fan and was trying to snap a candid pic of the young actors. \u201cI also maybe accidentally caught Ridley Scott asleep.\u201d\n\n50 Shades Freed is unleashed on movie theaters February 9.
