But I\u2019m not good with this sort of thing and I\u2019m sorry \u2014 especially to those of you who came here to see the show in person, because that\u2019s probably not what you came for. But we lost someone that we and I love very much today.\u201d\n\nRickles died on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 90.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to \u2014 not only have Don on this show as my guest \u2014 but also to become close to him and his wife Barbara, which was a lot of fun for me,\u201d Kimmel said.\n\nKimmel described Rickles as a towering presence in Las Vegas, where Kimmel grew up, and where Rickles found his greatest success as a stand-up comic. He also described the first time Rickles \u2014 who rose to fame as a frequent guest on Johnny Carson\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d \u2014 appeared on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d in 2006.\n\n\u201cIt was so exciting,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cI felt like I was in some kind of talk show host fantasy camp. Sitting behind a desk while Don Rickles made fun of me. It was like being a real talk show host for a minute. For twenty minutes, it was like being Johnny Carson.\u201d\n\nRickles appeared on Kimmel\u2019s show 17 times more in the years that followed.\n\nKimmel also talked about taking Rickles, famous for his insult comedy, out to Mario Batali\u2019s Los Angeles restaurant Mozza. \u201cWe rented the private room in back,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cWe had food, I invited his friends \u2014 it was beautiful. It was very expensive. At the end of the meal, he said, \u2018I can\u2019t believe you took me to a pizza place.'\u201d\n\nKimmel closed his monologue with a video tribute to Rickles, showing the best moments from the comedian\u2019s appearance on the ABC show.
