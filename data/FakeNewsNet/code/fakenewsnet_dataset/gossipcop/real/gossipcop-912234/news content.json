And that includes the film\u2019s climatic helicopter chase scene.\n\nIn an interview for the film\u2019s upcoming Blu-Ray release, Cruise\u2019s leading lady in the film, Rebecca Ferguson, discussed a scene where Cruise\u2019s character, Ethan Hunt, dangles from the underside of a flying helicopter. Then, Ethan loses his grip on the helicopter, dropping onto a cargo load being lifted by the helicopter and grabbing onto it to avoid plummeting to his death in the canyon below.\n\nAlso Read: 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout': How Tom Cruise Pulled Off That Insane Skydive\n\nFerguson saw Cruise as he did the fall and, not noticing that he had a safety harness, thought that he had just killed himself.\n\n\u201cI heard myself scream. I actually thought he fell,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere was an audible gasp from the crowd. That\u2019s a huge drop,\u201d co-star Henry Cavill added in the Blu-Ray interview.\n\nWhat was worse for Cruise is that he shot that stunt five times, only to move on to another death-defying sequence in which he flew a helicopter through the mountains at low-altitude for a chase scene that required him to get dangerously close to another helicopter.\n\nAlso Read: Did Tom Cruise Really Do All the Stunts in 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout'?\n\nOh, and he also performed the highest free fall skydive ever filmed for a movie and broke his leg while jumping between buildings in London. As we noted this past summer, you wouldn\u2019t be faulted for thinking that Tom Cruise might have a death wish.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d is available on Digital Nov. 20, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on Dec. 4.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spider-man-far-from-home-DF-06693_r.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fast-and-furious-every-car-ranked-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Mission-Impossible-Collage-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChloeDan-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anita-160x105.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-5.59.05-PM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/envelope.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MI5.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/SpiderMan-Zendaya-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CMS_EW_061919_Comedy618x742-1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/070919_Whitman_Quibi_1092px.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/MIfallout-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1153289783-1-e1562700127279.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2F5A0156.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster", "Brian Welk", "Thom Geier", "Ross A.
