Especially when the lion gets to spend eight times a week on a stage and travel around the country.\n\nNia Holloway and Jared Dixon are headed to the William Saroyan Theatre for a two-week stint playing two of the lead roles in \u201cDisney\u2019s The Lion King.\u201d The show runs from Nov. 28 through Dec. 9, with tickets ranging from $35 to $129.\n\nThey\u2019re part of a tradition that has been around for nearly their entire lives, performing in a show that more than 90 million people have seen since it first took to the stage in 1997, bringing to life the 1994 animated movie of the same name.\n\nMore: Gala of the Royal Horses will prance into Tulare County Fairgrounds\n\nFamily-friendly Coyote Entertainment Center coming to Tachi Palace on Nov. 30\n\nVisalia's Cellar Door 2.0: Pop-up kitchen, craft cocktails and (of course) lots of music\n\nVisalia Players hit a comedic bullseye with 'Escanaba in Da Moonlight'\n\nThe show features puppets and costumes on an epic scale, with all the animals of the Serengeti parading through the theater and across the stage in a theatrical extravaganza that, under Julia Taymor\u2019s direction, changed forever what people conceived of could be done on stage.\n\nFor Holloway, the role of adult Nala (another actress plays the young Nala) changed her life. She auditioned for the role while she was in high school\u2014when she was technically still too young to play the role. She went to the auditions anyway and ended up being cast as the youngest person to ever play the role.\n\nShe spent her senior year on the road and has been with the show ever since, for four years.\n\n\u201cLion King has made me a stronger person and performer,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cMy family has said I\u2019ve gone to Lion King College. It is truly an experience onstage that has helped me become the person I want to be.\u201d\n\nNia Holloway as \u201cNala,\u201d Buyi Zama as \u201cRafiki\u201d and \u201cThe Lionesses\u201d in THE LION KING North American Tour.

She\u2019s very strong and grounded as I have come into my womanhood.\u201d\n\nHolloway said her character is one that inspires young people, and that she truly appreciates the responsibility of providing such a role model. Nala is also a character that has taught her things.\n\n\u201cNala has taught be to be both strong and soft at the same time,\u201d said Holloway. \u201cNala is a princess warrior who is very strong and driven, but at the same time, she has a vulnerable side. She is very compassionate even while she gets things done.\n\n\u201cNala is a role model for men and women because she is such a young powerhouse. This is especially true for millennials who are the ones getting things done and making change. She is someone who inspires them, is close to them and they can relate to.\u201d\n\nGerald Caesar as Simba in the U.S. tour of \"Disney's The Lion King.\" (Photo: Deen van Meer)\n\nDixon is just joining the Lion King cast\u2014he\u2019s been with the show for only two months, most of that in rehearsals. He took on the role of Simba after performing in such shows as \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d \u201cCruel Intentions,\u201d \u201cViolet,\u201d \u201cHairspray,\u201d \u201cSister Act\u201d and \u201cHello Again.\u201d\n\nYet, he said being a lion isn\u2019t that different from the human roles he\u2019s been playing.\n\n\u201cThe Lion King crew really did a great job of making the characters realistic and playable in live theater,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cI put the same amount of emotion in being Simba that I do human characters. He\u2019s not one note. He is a volatile character. He\u2019s very dynamic emotionally and I get to play my happiest self and my saddest self. It\u2019s a journey of a role.\u201d\n\nDixon said the role\u2019s biggest challenge is a mental one, even with its high physical demands. He describes it as constantly playing chess with himself, trying to decide whether to go bigger or smaller with each emotional choice while always trying to live within the realm of believability.\n\n\u201cI see how my body responds to choices, how the audience responds and how other actors respond,\u201d said Dixon. \u201cThey do a really great job of training everyone on the physical vocabulary of the show. Everyone has their own physicality that mirrors their animal.\u201d\n\nAt 30 years old, Dixon said the Lion King has always been a part of his consciousness. He loved it as a kid and saw it on stage when he was 8, the year the musical first opened.\n\n\u201cIt opened my eyes to the possibilities of theater,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cThis show is groundbreaking. When it was done, it had never been done before. The innovation and creation really changed theater and it changed my mind about how theater can be more than three-dimensional.\u201d\n\n\"Disney's The Lion King\" (Photo: Matthew Murphy)\n\nWhile the spectacle and wonder of the show with its huge masks, African-inspired costumes, and memorable music crashed onto the scene and snagged the show six Tony awards, including best musical, both Holloway and Dixon say it is the story that keeps people filling the theaters in what in 2014 became the top-earning title in box office history, surpassing the record previously held by \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story of Simba being a young cub who has to take on responsibility, the circle of life, it is just truly a universal story,\u201d said Holloway. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you came from or what age you are. You can come and watch something that respects the world. It\u2019s just beautiful.\u201d\n\nDixon said that even though our world has changed over the past 30 years, the show continues to be relevant and continues to speak to people.\n\n\u201cMillions of people return for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something for everyone in this show, from the youngest child to the oldest child, and we\u2019re all children in some way. The story spans across so many different ideas and concepts, that it is still relevant. It still speaks to people. We are all partaking in something that is greater than ourselves, that speaks to our humanity through animals.\u201d\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: \u201cDisney\u2019s The Lion King\u201d\n\nWhere: Saroyan Theatre\n\nWhen: Nov. 28-Dec. 9\n\nTickets: $35 to $129\n\nInformation: https://fresno.broadway.com/\n\nDisney's The Lion King US North American Tour (Photo: Deen van Meer)\n\nEntertainment newsletter Looking for something to do this weekend?
