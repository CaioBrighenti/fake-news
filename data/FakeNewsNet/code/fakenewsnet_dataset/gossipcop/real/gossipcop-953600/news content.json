Here We Go Again.\n\nWhile Pierce\u2019s singing in the films have divided fans, he shared during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night (19Jul18) that his friend Barbra\u2019s pet dog Samantha didn\u2019t seem to appreciate his vocal ability.\n\n\u201cBarbra Streisand is a friend, she lives in the same community, so we thought we\u2019d show it to Barbra. We went over to her house and put the movie on and she said, \u2018Come sit beside me, darling.\u2019 I sat there thinking, \u2018Oh my God, what am I doing, showing this to Barbra Streisand?'\u201d he recalled of his first viewing of the flick. \u201cAnd the movie finished and she said, \u2018That was absolutely wonderful.\u2019 I said, \u2018Thank you so much.\u2019 And at that point, her dog Sammie bit my arm. She said, \u2018Sammie, are you alright?\u2019 And I said, \u2018But Barbra, she just bit me!'\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Pierce went on to share that he was \u201cterrified\u201d of singing during both films. However, he was comforted by the fact that his co-stars Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard were very nervous too.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that comforted me was seeing Colin Firth and Stellan Skarsgard looking equally as terrified on the day we did the recordings,\u201d the 65-year-old smiled, adding that ABBA\u2019s Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus were very supportive on set. \u201cBenny and Bjorn are wonderful guys \u2013 legendary.\u201d\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again is now showing in cinemas.", "images": ["https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/app/uploads/2019/04/whatsapp-banner.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2120107461598065&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1ccf16aeac9c94d04dfdc8b80f3ff1c4/5DA6DBDD/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/66298825_2285725888176681_5862802084844806351_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/app/uploads/2019/05/Peoplemagazinelogo.png", "https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3ed6dfb9718a64df7caf68159dcd7daa/5DAC2A64/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/64247763_336106730599328_1522467952711273889_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/app/uploads/2019/07/pplcover-1.jpg", "https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bbd5be5145b668e5799d3c32e9383ab3/5DA047AB/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/62350524_2359239064354151_4210441296276784732_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ebe41d3332af1607c01929e8b5bbd8a7/5DB89B15/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/66390230_697482690716757_6651901175507308271_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=414241845615779&ev=PageView\r\n&noscript=1", "https://za.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/app/uploads/2019/05/peoplesafav.jpg", "https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/254107484b7e5bed10dfd7643c939b88/5DAB4A71/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/65300431_1297937397032675_5796739998465783916_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a03b9945e8cfb9f21173aedf4c8df891/5DBC1F44/t51.2885-15/e35/s150x150/65668576_357412058488678_8533116821252656875_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/356e67ebdb2d9af41106def3d4451a28/5DC0B37E/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s150x150/66505765_869246110105559_5674787754012369851_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/celebrity-news/international-celebrities/barbra-streisands-dog-bit-pierce-brosnan-after-hearing-him-sing/\nhttps:/www.peoplemagazine.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/iab_logo.png", "https://scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/7fafe9ca2a73f4ab39411b6865508130/5DC5C412/t51.2885-15/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s150x150/64942399_422580184997211_2349630898305125277_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.cdninstagram.com", "https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/app/uploads/2016/02/d-peopleSwit-100x100.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/app/uploads/2019/05/peoplesafav.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.peoplemagazine.co.za/celebrity-news/international-celebrities/barbra-streisands-dog-bit-pierce-brosnan-after-hearing-him-sing/", "title": "Barbra Streisand\u2019s dog bit Pierce Brosnan after hearing him sing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Barbra Streisand's dog bit Pierce Brosnan after hearing him sing | People Magazine", "description": "Barbra Streisand's dog bit Pierce Brosnan after hearing him sing in the Mamma Mia! movie.The actor portrayed Sam Carmichael in the 2008 jukebox movie featuring the songs of Swedish pop group ABBA and is reprising his role in the follow-up, Mamma Mia!
