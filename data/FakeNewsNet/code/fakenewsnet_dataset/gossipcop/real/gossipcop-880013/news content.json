The iconic supermodel takes to the picturesque streets of Tokyo, in a pixie cut and black pantsuit no less, and lip-syncs to Wham's guilty pleasure classic \"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do),\" VHS karaoke lyrics and all. The video also features a diverse set of models, including Adwoa Aboah, strutting their stuff across Tokyo parks and hotspots in H&M's signature fuzzy knits and patterned blouses. It feels like a celebration of the more inclusive model generation that Naomi has spearheaded thus far, with the queen at the center of it all.\n\n<a href=\"http://adserver.adtechus.com/adlink/3.0/5151/5063854/0/0/ADTECH;loc=300;key=key1+key2+key3+key4;grp=[group]\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"//adserver.adtechus.com/adserv/3.0/5151/5063854/0/0/ADTECH;loc=300;key=key1+key2+key3+key4;grp=[group]\" border=\"0\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\"></a>\n\n\"Tokyo is definitely one of my favorite places,\" Naomi said in a statement. \"For the film, I was in a dark double-breasted trouser suit and it was my favorite look from the whole collection. Personally, I would wear it exactly as it was styled \u2014 the tailored blazer was buttoned up, but you could see a little skin so it was a good balance of feminine and masculine.\" Add powerful to that description as well.
