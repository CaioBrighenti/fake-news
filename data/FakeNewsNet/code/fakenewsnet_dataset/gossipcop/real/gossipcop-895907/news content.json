Only 747s, private. I\u2019ve never even heard of this, but whatever.\u201d\n\nThe insider says Kardashian-West accompanied West to Japan for an \u201cartistic trip.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Called \u2018Obnoxious,\u2019 \u2018Wasteful\u2019 for Flying on Private, Empty 747\n\n\u201cHe feels very inspired and creative at the moment, so she wants to be supportive,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe is aware of the 747 backlash\u2014it wasn\u2019t her idea. And again, she is trying to be supportive of Kanye. She realize it\u2019s seen as something unnecessary and extravagant, but she isn\u2019t making any excuses. They have a different lifestyle and she doesn\u2019t expect other people to understand.\u201d\n\nIn her videos, Kardashian showed off the customized interior, which featured lounge areas, bedrooms and spacious cabins full of empty seats. The jet also contained plenty of work space, which the mother of three called the \u201cYeezy floating office.\u201d In another video clip, she shouted out \u201cTeam Adidas,\u201d Yeezy\u2019s parent company.\n\n\u201cSo this is what a private 747 is like, you guys. I\u2019ve never been on one before. Oh my god, there\u2019s bedrooms everywhere. No big deal. This is like endless,\u201d she said, noting it was \u201cpretty insane.\u201d\n\nMany people were quick to call out the couple for the over-the-top mode of transport, with one Twitter user writing, \u201cAll I\u2019m thinking is what a waste of jet fuel, resources, environmental harm, etc. etc. etc. Smh. Obnoxious and unnecessary.\u201d\n\nWATCH THIS: 3 Cars of the Kardashian-Jenner Family\n\nAnother commenter on Twitter felt that taking the extravagant trip after making a half-million-dollar donation to wildfire relief efforts was hypocritical.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m missing the connection. @KimKardashian and @kanyewest donate 500000$ to wildfire relief efforts, but take a 747 airplane privately,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWill someone explain to them how the climate crisis works? Please?\u201d\n\nBut not everyone was critical of their travel tactics.\n\n\u201cKanye West always ahead of [his] time. The glee in Kim Kardashian\u2019s voice though . . . she truly loves her husband.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Inside the Kardashian-Jenner Family\u2019s Million-Dollar Real Estate Empire\n\nAlthough they faced plenty of backlash for the incident, the source added that the 747, which Travel & Leisure noted could hold up to 660 passengers and is the same model of plane as Air Force One, doesn\u2019t actually belong to West.\n\n\u201cKanye didn\u2019t buy the jet,\u201d the source says. \u201cIt was a loaner.\u201d", "images":
