The order prevented Rob from contacting Chyna \u201ceither directly or indirectly, in any way\u201d and required him to stay away from her, her home and place of work.\n\nRob has also denied the physical and verbal assault claims brought against him by his ex. In a statement to PEOPLE in response, Chyna\u2019s attorney Lisa Bloom said her team is \u201cconfident that we will prevail on this motion and at trial.\u201d\n\nA court date in Los Angeles was previously set for Thursday to present the Kardashians\u2019 case for having the lawsuit dropped.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kim-social.jpg",
