Now, Rippon and Johnson fulfilled that dream and won the competition on last night\u2019s (May 21) episode.\n\nThe two rejoiced over their win for good reason; Rippon was the first openly gay man to take home the prize, and this was Johnson\u2019s first win after being on the show for only two seasons. \u201cWinning the Mirrorball has now taken on a new meaning, someone like me is accepted and I feel loved,\u201d Rippon said before the pair\u2019s freestyle dance routine.\n\nIn another clip before their first dance routine of the evening, Johnson went as far as to say that Rippon should consider a career in dance. \u201cEvery day, to see him progress, I think he was supposed to be a dancer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe duo earned their trophy that night by excelling in their two performances. Their first dance, a jazz routine to the Broadway classic \u201cAnything You Can Do\u201d from Annie Get Your Gun, was a stunning routine that brought the audience to their feet and received a perfect score from the judges. \u201cIt was so exquisitely theatrical,\u201d judge Bruno Tonioli told the pair. \u201cTechnically, it was brilliant. Your timing and partner work is flawless.\u201d\n\nTheir second dance of the night, a gay-as-hell freestyle to DJ Kass\u2019 \u201cScooby Doo Pa Pa\u201d featuring vogueing, fan-snapping and more, did not impress the judges as much. \u201cI can\u2019t fault you for what you did, but I feel like I was missing something,\u201d said judge Carrie Ann Inaba. \u201cThere were moments where I saw you (Adam) blank out a little bit.\u201d The pair still ended up with a 28 out of 30.\n\nWatch Rippon and Johnson\u2019s full trophy-winning performances below:", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/02-adam-rippon-jenna-johnson-dwts-5-21-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/02-adam-rippon-jenna-johnson-dwts-5-21-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/02-adam-rippon-jenna-johnson-dwts-5-21-2018-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephen Daw"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8457369/adam-rippon-wins-dancing-with-the-stars-athletes-routine-videos", "title": "Adam Rippon Is Crowned the 'DWTS' Season 26 Winner After Two Striking Routines", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Adam Rippon Wins 'Dancing With the Stars: Athelets:' Watch His Final Routines", "description": "Ever since their first cha-cha dance to RuPaul\u2019s iconic club song \u201cSissy That Walk,\u201d Adam RIppon and Jenna Johnson were the favorites to win the Mirrorball trophy on Dancing With the Stars: Athletes.
