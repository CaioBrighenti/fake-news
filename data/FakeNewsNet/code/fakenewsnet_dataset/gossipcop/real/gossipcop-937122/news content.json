Though the marriage didn't have quite the happy ending expected, Diana's wedding in July of 1981 was the fairytale everyone wanted. Ask anyone who was alive in 1981 to tell you where they watched Prince Charles and Diana's royal wedding and we bet they have it engraved in their memory. Watched by one billion spectators the world over, Charles and Diana's \"I dos\" were nothing short of spectacular. From Princess Diana's over-the-top wedding dress (which like Kate Middleton's and now Meghan Marke's spawned an entire generation of look-alike brides), to the 27 wedding cakes, and the throngs of spectators waiting to wish the couple well, every detail of this royal wedding has been pored over and over for the last three (almost four!) decades.\n\nWant even more royal wedding bliss? We've scoured the depths of the internets to bring you 30 photos from Prince Charles and Princess Diana's wedding we bet you haven't seen.
