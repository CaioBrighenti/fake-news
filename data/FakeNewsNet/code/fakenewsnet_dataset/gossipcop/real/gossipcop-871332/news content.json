{"url": "https://www.wikihow.com/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner", "text": "Your style choices don't have to end with the clothes you wear. Consider your purse, earrings, jewelry, bracelets, and more when putting your outfit together. This is a great chance to be creative - if you're going for the classic Kylie black-and-white look, almost any color of accessory will go with your outfit.\n\nGood makeup can be the cherry on top of a perfect outfit. It's rare to see either of the Jenner sisters overly-made-up, so keep the mantra \"less is more\" in mind when applying your own makeup. Kylie likes to go for a minimally-made up with light highlights around the eyes and some shiny lipgloss. Occasionally, she'll go bold with some bright red or crimson lipstick - if you want to go for the 1940s pinup look, go for it!\n\nNot surprisingly, Kylie and Kendall's biggest fashion role-models are their sisters!Kourtney, Kim & Khloe are international fashion icons in their own right - watch \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" or any of its spin offs for plenty of fashion ideas from the Jenner and Kardashian sisters!\n\n4\n\nAdd your own flavor. Kylie and Kendall may be fashion icons at 16 and 17 respectively, but that doesn't mean their sense of style should overrule your own fashion instincts. For a truly unforgettable look, inject your own creativity into your outfits. Experiment with clothing and accessories that the sisters wouldn't wear. Remember to be yourself! It's fun to imitate the looks of our favorite fashionistas, but it's also important to cultivate our own identities. Use common sense and don't take fashion too seriously - a girl is much, much more important than her clothes!", "images": ["https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/92/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-4-Version-3.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-4-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3d/Behave-Like-Kimmy-Kopke-from-Dance-Moms-Miami-Step-9.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Behave-Like-Kimmy-Kopke-from-Dance-Moms-Miami-Step-9.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/55/Look-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-29.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Look-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-29.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/56/Look-Like-Kourtney-Kardashian-Step-17.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Look-Like-Kourtney-Kardashian-Step-17.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/56/Look-Like-Kourtney-Kardashian-Step-17.jpg/-crop-127-140-127px-Look-Like-Kourtney-Kardashian-Step-17.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fa/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-5-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ef/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-10-Version-3.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-10-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/e/ef/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-10-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/5b/Act-and-Look-Like-Nicole-%28Snooki%29-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Act-and-Look-Like-Nicole-%28Snooki%29-Step-5-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/db/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-8-Version-3.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-8-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d5/Do-Your-Makeup-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/-crop-342-184-327px-Do-Your-Makeup-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-15-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/5/55/Look-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-29.jpg/-crop-127-140-127px-Look-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-29.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/3e/Emulate-Kourtney-Kardashian-Step-10.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Emulate-Kourtney-Kardashian-Step-10.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/24/Dress-Like-Khloe-Kardashian-Step-11-Version-2.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Dress-Like-Khloe-Kardashian-Step-11-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8a/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-9-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/23/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-6-Version-3.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-6-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9c/Look-Like-Cheryl-Cole-Step-25.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Look-Like-Cheryl-Cole-Step-25.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/48/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-1-Version-3.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-1-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ec/Be-Beautiful%2C-Just-Like-Lauren-Conrad-Step-3.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Be-Beautiful%2C-Just-Like-Lauren-Conrad-Step-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/1b/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-3-Version-3.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-3-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/be/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-2-Version-3.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-2-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/skins/owl/images/wikihow_logo.png", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d5/Do-Your-Makeup-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-15-Version-2.jpg/-crop-127-140-127px-Do-Your-Makeup-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-15-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/89/Look-Like-Kim-Kardashian-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/-crop-127-140-127px-Look-Like-Kim-Kardashian-Step-14-Version-2.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/34/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/aid3116492-v4-728px-Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-7-Version-3.jpg", "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/89/Look-Like-Kim-Kardashian-Step-14-Version-2.jpg/-crop-342-184-245px-Look-Like-Kim-Kardashian-Step-14-Version-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.wikihow.com/images/e/ef/Dress-Like-Kylie-Jenner-Step-10-Version-3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Wikihow Staff", "This Article Was Co-Authored Our Trained Team Of Editors", "Researchers Who Validated It For Accuracy", "Comprehensiveness.
