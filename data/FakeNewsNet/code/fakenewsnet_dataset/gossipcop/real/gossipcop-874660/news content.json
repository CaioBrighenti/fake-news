I'm from Louisiana. I'm from the South and I like to keep it real, so I want to just make sure I keep having you motherf*ckers something to talk about, okay?\" The 35-year-old then launched into her soulful cover of the sassy track, confidently strutting across the stage and proving once and for all that the vocal tracks she uses in her concerts are purely for backup purposes, as she's repeatedly stated.\n\nMost recently, prior to a July performance in Tel Aviv, Spears responded to lip-syncing rumors in an interview with an Israeli TV program, according to Entertainment Weekly . \"A lot of people think that I don't sing live,\" she said. \"I usually, because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback. It really pisses me off because I am busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever really gives me credit for it, you know?\" And in a 2014 interview with Medium shortly after Spears's \u00fcber-successful four-year residency began, one of her managers, Adam Leber, backed up the \"...Baby One More Time\" singer's claims. \"To put on the show that she puts on, it's virtually impossible to sing the entire time and do what she does. She's singing on every song, basically, when she has the ability to sing,\" he said. \"There's no way you can dance for 90 minutes straight and sing the entire time.\"\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nActresses Priyanka Chopra and Jodie Foster Reinterpret \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears", "images": ["https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f1832802c577242df3ef7/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Bella%20Hadid.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bc307a3e0603bb278f/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-491955476_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/599af8c3a60c781bf94797b6/3:2/w_640/britney.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c3be685e48a5c0010b/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-657657344_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c2be685e48a5c00105/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-647558208_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bb307a3e0603bb2789/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-2011783_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bbbe685e48a5c000fd/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-112345603_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bebe685e48a5c000ff/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-546573262_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c1be685e48a5c00103/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-635621416_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c0d0a2ff28f2da594f/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-634995032_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c0307a3e0603bb2797/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-635365770_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c1d0a2ff28f2da5951/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-646573810_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c0307a3e0603bb2795/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-635290756_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bb307a3e0603bb278d/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-120986055_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bbd0a2ff28f2da5945/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-1602325_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c3307a3e0603bb2799/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-660927384_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bb307a3e0603bb278b/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-52285806_master.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f1855cc1eac746f6e7549/1:1/w_128,c_limit/Kristen%20Stewert.jpg", "https://www.wmagazine.com/images/w_logo.svg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bd307a3e0603bb2791/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-500820096_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c1d0a2ff28f2da5953/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-647295640_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7c3d0a2ff28f2da5957/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-660104850_master.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/599af8c3a60c781bf94797b6/2:1/w_790,c_limit/britney.jpg", "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/58e7a7bbbe685e48a5c000fb/master/h_320,c_limit/GettyImages-51095400_master.jpg", "https://vulcan.condenastdigital.com/wmag-services/photos/592f184acc1eac746f6e7547/1:1/w_128,c_limit/kendall%20jenner.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/599af8c3a60c781bf94797b6/2:1/w_790,c_limit/britney.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "http://www.wmagazine.com/story/britney-spears-performs-something-to-talk-about", "title": "Britney Spears Performs \"Something to Talk About\" Live", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "author": "Andrea Park", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Britney Spears responded to accusations of lip-syncing by performing a cover of Bonnie Raitt's \"Something to Talk About\" at her Las Vegas concert on Saturday.", "publishDate": "2017-08-21T17:51:00Z", "keywords": "Britney Spears,snd", "fb": {"app_id": 230068530489385, "admins": 108943, "pages": 40621875003}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "title": "Britney Spears Shut Down Years of Lip-Synch Haters", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/britney-spears-performs-something-to-talk-about", "description": "Bow down to Godney.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/599af8c3a60c781bf94797b6/2:1/w_790,c_limit/britney.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "wmag", "title": "Britney Spears Shut Down Years of Lip-Synch Haters", "description": "Bow down to Godney.", "image": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/599af8c3a60c781bf94797b6/2:1/w_790,c_limit/britney.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "domain": "wmagazine.com"}, "version": "2.0.0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6Lj6TPpgC4"], "publish_date": 1503337860.0, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
