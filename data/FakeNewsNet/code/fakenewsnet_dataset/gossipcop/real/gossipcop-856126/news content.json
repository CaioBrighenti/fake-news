There's a situation,\" Perry said. \"Honestly, it's really like she started it, and it's time for her to finish it.\"\n\nSpeculation about the years-long feud has been circulating since Taylor Swift released the hit single \"Bad Blood,\" rumored to be about Perry.\n\nBut the conflict came back into the public eye after Perry performed a song believed to be inspired by her beef with Swift, \"Swish Swish,\" on this past weekend's \"Saturday Night Live.\" Perry didn't confirm that the song was inspired by Swift, but she was clear that it would make perfect sense.\n\nPerry said it all started over three of her backup dancers going to work on Swift's tour with Perry's blessing. But when Perry was getting ready to launch her tour, they approached Swift's tour management about being able to go back on tour with Perry when she needed it. According to Perry. the dancers were then fired. The \"Roar\" singer also said she had tried to reach out to Swift to discuss the situation, but hasn't gotten a response.\n\n\"I tried to talk to her about it, and she wouldn't speak to me,\" Perry said. \"I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown, and then she writes a song about me, and I'm like, okay, cool, cool, cool, that's how you want to deal with it? Karma!\"\n\nPerry also says she would love to squash the conflict.\n\n\"What I want to say is that I'm ready for that B.S. to be done,\" she said. \"Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, there's going to be a reaction, and trust me, daddy, there's going to be a reaction.\"", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59244736639147b7208b58fa-1920-960.png", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/592446e9639147711a8b50ce-750-563.png"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59244736639147b7208b58fa-1920-960.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jethro Nededog"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/katy-perry-taylor-swift-feud-james-corden-carpool-karaoke-2017-5", "title": "Katy Perry addresses her feud with Taylor Swift: 'She started it'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-05-23", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-23", "news_keywords": "TV, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, James Corden, CBS, carpool karaoke, late-night, the late late show with james corden, Jethro Nededog", "sailthru.tags": "TV, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, James Corden, CBS, carpool karaoke, late-night, the late late show with james corden, Jethro Nededog", "description": "On \"Carpool Karaoke\" with James Corden, Katy Perry explains why she and Taylor Swift have beef that has become very public since \"Bad Blood.\"", "sailthru.description": "On \"Carpool Karaoke\" with James Corden, Katy Perry explains why she and Taylor Swift have beef that has become very public since \"Bad Blood.\"", "title": "Katy Perry addresses her feud with Taylor Swift: 'She started it'", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire", "sailthru.title": "Katy Perry addresses her feud with Taylor Swift: 'She started it'", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59244736639147b7208b58fa-1920-960.png", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/592446e9639147711a8b50ce-1334-1001.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/592446e9639147711a8b50ce-160-120.png", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "sailthru.author": "Jethro Nededog", "og": {"title": "Katy Perry addresses her feud with Taylor Swift: 'She started it'", "description": "On \"Carpool Karaoke\" with James Corden, Katy Perry explains why she and Taylor Swift have beef that has become very public since \"Bad Blood.\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/katy-perry-taylor-swift-feud-james-corden-carpool-karaoke-2017-5", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59244736639147b7208b58fa-1920-960.png", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Jethro Nededog", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/katy-perry-taylor-swift-feud-james-corden-carpool-karaoke-2017-5", "title": "Katy Perry addresses her feud with Taylor Swift: 'She started it'", "description": "On \"Carpool Karaoke\" with James Corden, Katy Perry explains why she and Taylor Swift have beef that has become very public since \"Bad Blood.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59244736639147b7208b58fa-1920-960.png", "creator": "@TheRealJethro", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "Katy Perry addresses her feud with Taylor Swift": {" 'She started it'": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495512000.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
