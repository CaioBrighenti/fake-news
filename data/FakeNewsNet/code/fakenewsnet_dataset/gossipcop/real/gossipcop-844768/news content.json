And everything else about me sort of gets pushed to the wayside.\"\n\nIronically, having his gender identity revealed on national television, Smith said, has helped him get over some of those insecurities.\n\n\"'Survivor,' it makes you tough, it makes you resilient, and it makes you adaptable,\" the 29-year-old confessed to the camera. \"I think I had all those qualities before, but they\u2019ve certainly been strengthened and grown. And I think I was able to be a little more brave and a little bolder, to help others, and also to get over my own fears and to get over my own issues and complexes and insecurities of being transgender.\"\n\n\"It is heartening in this game ... that people who are out to get you in some regard do come to your defense,\" Smith added. \"But in the meantime, there\u2019s still a task at hand. A task that I\u2019m rather committed to. I\u2019m here to win a million dollars. I\u2019m here to play 'Survivor.' So let\u2019s just get back to it.\"\n\nLater, when Smith's tribe merged with the competing tribe, he shared what happened in the tribal council and that he is transgender.\n\n\"Though it happened in a way that I wasn't crazy about, I think I, like all of you, am forever changed, and forever evolved by my experience on 'Survivor' and was a much stronger and more capable person in that moment,\" he told his new tribe mates.\n\nAfter last week's episode, which was taped 10 months ago, aired, Varner was fired from his job at a North Carolina real estate company.\n\nSmith wrote in a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter that he's not \"wild\" about people knowing that he is trans, but is proud of the way he handled it.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Zeke-Smith-MEM-170420_12x5_992.jpg", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Zeke-Smith-MEM-170420_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Zeke-Smith-MEM-170420_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Luchina Fisher"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/zeke-smith-moves-outed-trans-survivor/story?id=46908743", "title": "Zeke Smith moves on after being outed as trans on 'Survivor'", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The", "keywords": "zeke smith, survivor, transgender,entertainment news, celebrity news, celebrity gossip", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Zeke Smith moves on after being outed on 'Survivor'", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "Zeke Smith moves on after being outed on 'Survivor'", "description": "The \"Survivor\" contestant who was outed as transgender was back in the game.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/zeke-smith-moves-outed-trans-survivor/story?id=46908743", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Zeke-Smith-MEM-170420_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "zeke smith, survivor, transgender", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "@luchina", "title": "Zeke Smith moves on after being outed on 'Survivor'", "description": "The \"Survivor\" contestant who was outed as transgender was back in the game.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/zeke-smith-moves-outed-trans-survivor/story?id=46908743", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Zeke-Smith-MEM-170420_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,46908743", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,46908743", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/zeke-smith-moves-outed-trans-survivor/story?id=46908743"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,46908743", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,46908743", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/zeke-smith-moves-outed-trans-survivor/story?id=46908743", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/zeke-smith-moves-outed-trans-survivor/story?id=46908743"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
