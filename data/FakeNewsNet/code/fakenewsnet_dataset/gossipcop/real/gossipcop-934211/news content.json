Just make sure they don\u2019t touch my two-egg scramble. I seem crazy, no? Clearly I\u2019m not having a good week. Adam, of three years, announces he went on a date, and that takes me by surprise. But it\u2019s not as surprising as the passive-aggressive digs my friend continues to make about me. I see you\u2026\n\nBethenny can invite whomever the hell she wants to Puerto Rico, but could it be that I didn\u2019t express any interest in going because she didn\u2019t express any interest in having me go? I didn\u2019t know she and Dorinda were going until they were already there. While she talks smack about me on the show, I\u2019m saying how proud I am of her. Wow\u2026at this point, I'm just sitting back with popcorn like the rest of you, watching this TV character (who I thought was a good friend) continue to take cheap shots. It\u2019s strange that she would say I have no interest in what is going on in Puerto Rico. I was writing checks. I\u2019d asked her many times how things were going. A good friend of mine works with Michael Capponi, and I connected her and Bethenny.\n\nOn the other hand, I really don\u2019t give a damn, because my actions speak for themselves. I won\u2019t bore you here recounting the endless places I\u2019ve been to or the stories I\u2019ve brought back exposing neglect, destruction, and people\u2019s sufferings. I did a story once on the landmine crisis, and the head of the campaign went on to win a Noble Peace prize. I\u2019m not bragging \u2014 it wasn\u2019t my prize \u2014 but I brought attention to a horrible atrocity, and a good thing happened as a result. It may not be private planes, cargo ships, and cash cards, but it\u2019s something.\n\nI am socially aware and politically active. Even when it is uncomfortable, as you saw last season, when I was part of a large \u201cget out the vote\u201d campaign for Hillary Clinton. I know, I know \u2014 I was wrong. Trump won. Sure, it didn\u2019t end as I would have liked (understatement), but I remain committed to the idea that good government will bring about good change. I am also grateful to private citizens like Bethenny who step up to fill in the gaping holes. I just don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s fully committed this season to talking about me as though I\u2019m a Miss America contestant who banged her prom date. Haahaahaaa.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll find out next week. Pass the popcorn!", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-05/rhony-1109-sonja-blog.jpg?itok=PCJIkuXa", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/briana-ryan-culberson-grocery-shopping.jpg?itok=QiQLmgVL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/1021/703/190709_3985566_Andy_Cohen_Reacts_to_Lisa_Vanderpump_s_Absen.jpg?itok=lNfk2wvQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=8qj_CxiN", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/bravo_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Bravo/577/678/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/contributor-logo/public/field_person_cover_photo/2018/04/800x800_carole-radziwill.jpg?itok=SAMJen9Y", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/133/363/190710_3986067_Bethenny_Frankel_and_Ramona_Singer_Don_t_Thi.jpg?itok=Yh-RXhns", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/700/254/190711_3986570_The_Real_Housewives_of_New_York_City_Hear__F.jpg?itok=kIKF0cOO", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/699/779/190711_3986568_Next_on_RHONY__Reunion_Part_2.jpg?itok=_blfJA-R", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=sLRmUfZw", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/05/dish-bethenny-carole_2.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/225/655/190710_3986181_What_You_Didn_t_See_Ashley_Jacobs_Do_at_the_.jpg?itok=6y25G9ie", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/05/dish-bethenny-carole_1.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-04/rhony-1108-tinsley-blog.jpg?itok=FWzHz82A", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-04/rhony-1107-luann-blog.jpg?itok=b0-oxsjt", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/133/363/190710_3986073_Andy_Cohen_Said_This_Was_One_of_the_Most_Cri.jpg?itok=S1BejUef", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/dorit-kemsley-morgan-stewart-look-alikes_0.jpg?itok=uElmmY9J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=YMavsS5l", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-05/rhony-1109-luann-blog.jpg?itok=hHwUbCoo", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/235/682/190515_3956428_Sonja_Morgan_Informs_Luann_de_Lesseps_the_Ot.jpg?itok=si0EVz3R"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/bravo_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Bravo/577/678/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city/season-10/blogs/carole-radziwill/carole-radziwill-my-actions", "title": "Carole Radziwill: My Actions Speak for Themselves", "meta_data": {"title": "Carole Radziwill: My Actions Speak for Themselves | The Real Housewives of New York City Blog", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "Well, maybe I\u2019m not into Bethenny this week, but I\u2019m obviously into hard boiled eggs!
