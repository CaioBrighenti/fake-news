Its star, Emmy winner Jeffrey Tambor, was fired from his starring role after being accused of sexually harassing two women on the set (he has denied it).\n\nThe string of cancellations in 2018 comes as Amazon continues to clean house after a management shakeup.\n\nIn October, Amazon Studios head Roy Price resigned after allegations of sexual harassment surfaced, and CEO Jeff Bezos has reportedly directed a change in strategy at the company, which led to Amazon in November grabbing the rights to make a TV series based on \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nHere are the shows Amazon has killed, along with their critic and audience ratings from Metacritic:", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af089a519ee8625008b4971-1536-768.png", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af089d019ee8684288b4921-750-563.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af089a519ee8625008b4971-1536-768.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nathan Mcalone", "Carrie Wittmer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/shows-amazon-has-canceled-i-love-dick-one-mississippi-jean-claude-van-johnson-2018-1", "title": "The 13 shows Amazon has canceled, including Emmy winner 'Transparent'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "control"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-05-22", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-22", "news_keywords": "Features, Amazon, Amazon Prime Video, Nathan McAlone, Carrie Wittmer", "sailthru.tags": "Features, Amazon, Amazon Prime Video, Nathan McAlone, Carrie Wittmer", "description": "The shows Amazon has made for Prime Video that it has canceled so far, including 'Transparent,' 'Mozart in the Jungle,' 'One Mississippi,' and 'I Love Dick.'", "sailthru.description": "The shows Amazon has made for Prime Video that it has canceled so far, including 'Transparent,' 'Mozart in the Jungle,' 'One Mississippi,' and 'I Love Dick.'", "title": "The 13 shows Amazon has canceled, including Emmy winner 'Transparent'", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire, sai", "sailthru.title": "The 13 shows Amazon has canceled, including Emmy winner 'Transparent'", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "tbi-image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af089a519ee8625008b4971-1536-768.png", "sailthru.image.full": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af0899b19ee86d42d8b48ed-1136-852.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af0899b19ee86d42d8b48ed-160-120.png", "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "sailthru.author": "Carrie Wittmer", "og": {"title": "The 13 shows Amazon has canceled, including Emmy winner 'Transparent'", "description": "The shows Amazon has made for Prime Video that it has canceled so far, including 'Transparent,' 'Mozart in the Jungle,' 'One Mississippi,' and 'I Love Dick.'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/shows-amazon-has-canceled-i-love-dick-one-mississippi-jean-claude-van-johnson-2018-1", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af089a519ee8625008b4971-1536-768.png", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "author": "Nathan McAlone, Carrie Wittmer", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/shows-amazon-has-canceled-i-love-dick-one-mississippi-jean-claude-van-johnson-2018-1", "title": "The 13 shows Amazon has canceled, including Emmy winner 'Transparent'", "description": "The shows Amazon has made for Prime Video that it has canceled so far, including 'Transparent,' 'Mozart in the Jungle,' 'One Mississippi,' and 'I Love Dick.'", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5af089a519ee8625008b4971-1536-768.png", "creator": "@nmcalone", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "Business Insider": "Snapchat", "The 13 shows Amazon has canceled, including Emmy winner 'Transparent'": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526961600.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
