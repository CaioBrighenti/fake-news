The cast of the 2016 Warner Bros. film famously (or perhaps infamously) got matching \"SKWAD\" tattoos to commemorate their work together. But now Kinnaman thinks that may have been a bad idea.\n\nKinnaman was all smiles in a 2015 photo that captured Smith at work (although in the caption, the actor acknowledged, \"Will has many many talents, tattooing is not one of them\"). But when asked on Watch What Happens Live, he acknowledged he regretted the tattoo: \"The answer is yes. Absolutely. That was a horrible idea.\"\n\n\"You know, don't let a 47-year-old man without his reading glasses tattoo you,\" Kinnaman added \"That is the life lesson.\"\n\nDespite that regret, he admitted he received exactly what he asked for in the end. \"It's supposed to be a shitty tattoo,\" he said, \"so that's what it is.\"\n\nSuicide Squad 2 is expected to see return Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg, Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as The Joker and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. No release date has been announced, but the film is believed to begin production this fall.\n\n(via MTV)\n\nMy Hero Academia Creator Clarifies Remarks About Heroes Rising As Finale", "images": ["https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/th-logo-full-white.7684e614.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/sr-logo-full-white.b0cc2b44.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-white.642d3d01.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/hc-logo-full-white.5f66cfe4.svg", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/91f52889f6a04390a65ad2591c59986e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tq-logo-full-white.7436bde3.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-white.04a6f0d4.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/ts-logo-full-white.54beb4cf.svg", "https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/suicide-squad.jpg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tg-logo-full-white.fc9e742a.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/cb-logo-full-white.afca2e29.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-white.fe72c74c.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-white.8242bbb9.svg", "https://www.cbr.com/public/build/images/tr-logo-full-white.090c581a.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1639279299697145&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/suicide-squad.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Stone", "Brandon Staley", "Narayan Liu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbr.com/joel-kinnaman-regrets-letting-will-smith-give-him-a-skwad-tattoo/", "title": "Joel Kinnaman Regrets Letting Will Smith Give Him a 'SKWAD' Tattoo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Actor Joel Kinnaman says he now regrets allowing Will Smith to give him a tattoo to commemorate the filming of Suicide Squad.", "og": {"title": "Joel Kinnaman Regrets Letting Will Smith Give Him a 'SKWAD' Tattoo", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/suicide-squad.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "url": "https://www.cbr.com/joel-kinnaman-regrets-letting-will-smith-give-him-a-skwad-tattoo/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Actor Joel Kinnaman says he now regrets allowing Will Smith to give him a tattoo to commemorate the filming of Suicide Squad.", "site_name": "CBR"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-06T14:02:06Z", "section": "Movies"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1754119328184357, "pages": 10765693196}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517925726.0, "source": "https://www.cbr.com", "summary": ""}
