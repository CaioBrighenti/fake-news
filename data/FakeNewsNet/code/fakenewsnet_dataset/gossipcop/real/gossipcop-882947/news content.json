Tie your hair up and wrap it in a scarf to prevent oils and product buildup from irritating your skin. Change your bedding to a clean set to avoid transferring bacteria onto your clean skin while you sleep. Wash your bedding without fabric softener, which leaves behind a pore-clogging residue. Use a pillowcase made of natural fabric, as it breathes better and doesn't trap oil as easily as man-made fabrics.", "images": ["https://img.livestrong.com/630x/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/199/135/504243243.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://app.appsflyer.com/id502317923?pid=Livestrong.com%20Referrals&c=Smart%20Banner&af_dp=myplate%3A%2F%2F", "https://www.livestrong.com/lscp/images/svg/livestrong_logo_horizontal.svg", "https://img.livestrong.com/640/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/199/135/504243243.jpg", "https://www.livestrong.com/lscp/images/svg/close-black.svg"], "top_img": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/199/135/504243243.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Celeigh O'Neil"], "canonical_link": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/255500-how-to-cure-an-acne-breakout-overnight/", "title": "Is It Possible to Treat an Acne Breakout Overnight?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "cachetime": 2019071266529, "google-site-verification": "Zpt5B5Q5IH3uzuI4AilnP5Szp5o47SV6jLT0HKx0LCg", "fb": {"app_id": 49285624359, "ttl": 604800, "pages": 170615319988}, "og": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "When your face breaks out in acne the night before an important event, tailor your basic skin-care routine for quick healing.
