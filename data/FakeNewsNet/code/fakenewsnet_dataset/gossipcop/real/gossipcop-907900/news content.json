News during their pre-show about the time she met Oprah Winfrey.\n\nIt all went down in the bathroom at the Soho House.\n\n\u201cShe was coming out of the stall,\u201d Munn recalled of the 63-year-old talk show host. \u201cAt the Soho House, there\u2019s a window and not mirrors. And I see her in the reflection so I\u2019m washing my hands not saying anything.\u201d\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full SAG Awards coverage to get the latest news on Hollywood\u2019s big night and watch PEOPLE, Entertainment Weekly and TNT\u2019s official live red carpet show on Twitter or your favorite streaming devices.\n\nImage zoom Frazer Harrison/Getty; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nIt was Winfrey who finally broke the silence in the room: \u201d \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a full moon,\u2019 \u201d Munn remembered Winfrey saying.\n\nScrambling for something to say in return, Munn told Winfrey, \u201cI saw! You know what, in full moons they say crazy things happen and all my friends are breaking up.\u201d\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.

it\u2019s not a full moon \u2014 your friends are just breaking up,\u201d Munn recalled her saying.\n\nThe exchange had Munn laughing. \u201cI was like, \u2018I love you,\u2019 \u201d Munn said, explaining that Winfrey then walked out of the bathroom.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kristen Bell Talks Husband Dax Shepard\u2019s \u201cUnending Support\u201d For SAG Hosting Duties\n\nMunn will be one of the
