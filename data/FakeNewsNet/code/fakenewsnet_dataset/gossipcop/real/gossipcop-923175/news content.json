New Fashion Finds Our Editors Are Obsessing Over\n\n\u201cWe sent out so many gowns this season, it was nuts,\u201d Siriano previously told PeopleStyle. \u201cWe made a few more custom looks that didn\u2019t end up on the carpet so we probably would have had about 22 total if that would have happened. It\u2019s hard to say no when you love these women so much and want to support them.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/siriano.jpg",
