Attorneys for infamous criminals tell their stories in Oxygen\u2019s four-part documentary series In Defense Of, premiering Monday, June 25. These lawyers are true believers in the justice system, though not necessarily in their clients\u2019 innocence.", "images": ["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2tyr92K218M/hqdefault.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/articles/NUP_1833910004.jpg.1440x1000_q85_box-0%2C15%2C640%2C459_crop_detail.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V5xRprbAz7E/hqdefault.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/tv-video-download.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/articles/NUP_1833910004.jpg.1200x630_q85_box-0%2C13%2C640%2C348_crop.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.201/img/main-mv-logos/Footer.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/landing/mb_village300_100-3.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/authors/Jacqueline_Cutler.jpg.100x100_q85_box-97%2C0%2C998%2C902_crop.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.201/img/mediabizvillages_logo_min.svg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jzae4DKexko/hqdefault.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72WMprLONBQ/hqdefault.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-87PTHBI0gAVCI.gif", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.201/img/main-mv-logos/Header.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.201/img/II_logo_min.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/articles/NUP_1833910004.jpg.1200x630_q85_box-0%2C13%2C640%2C348_crop.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacqueline Cutler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mediavillage.com/article/in-defense-of-oxygen-series-looks-at-lawyers-who-defend-the-indefensible/", "title": "\u201cIn Defense Of\u201d: Oxygen Series Looks at Lawyers Who Defend the Indefensible", "meta_data": {"copyright": "MediaVillage, 2019.
