Alessia Cara, who took home best new artist. Recording Academy president Neil Portnow was asked by Variety about #GrammysSoMale and had this to say:\n\n\u201cIt has to begin with\u2026 women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level\u2026 [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome. I don\u2019t have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face but I think it\u2019s upon us \u2014 us as an industry \u2014 to make the welcome mat very obvious, breeding opportunities for all people who want to be creative and paying it forward and creating that next generation of artists.\u201d\n\nGrammys producer Ken Ehrlich deflected when asked the same question. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cI produce the TV show.\u201d As for whether it was a mistake to not give Album of the Year nominee Lorde an onstage moment, Ehrlich answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a mistake. These shows are a matter of choices. We have a box and it gets full. She had a great album. There\u2019s no way we can really deal with everybody.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lisa Loeb, Reba McEntire, Aimee Mann, and Carrie Fisher were among the female winners during the pre-telecast ceremony. Rihanna shared a win with Kendrick Lamar for best rap/sung performance for the song \u201cLoyalty.\u201d\n\nChris Stapleton, who won best country album, was more diplomatic: \u201cIt\u2019s always a hard thing to see things not go somebody\u2019s way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd equality is something we have to address on a lot of levels. I can\u2019t really speak to how voters voted and what happened there, but there is a lot of great music being made by a lot of great women. That is the only thing I know and the awards don\u2019t diminsh the art in any way.\u201d\n\nOne has to wonder if the attendance of Taylor Swift would have made a difference. Said Ehrlich: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t her year. She was kind of off cycle. Hopefully we\u2019ll see her next year.\u201d", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hbo-chernobyl.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10331334cg-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ed-sheeran-album-cover.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/neil-portnow.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/conan-obrien-kumail-nanjiani.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/schitts-creek-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/9245539a-cropped-e1562834428290.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stephanieniznik.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/big-little-lies-season-2-2.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_8410877w.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2Fgrammys-so-male-women-recording-academy-president-neil-portnow-1202679902%2F&ct=article&lob=pmc-core&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202679902&comment_count=63", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/r-kelly-sexual-assult-mug-shot.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/ed-sheeran.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger-things.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/influencer-drama-2019-james-charles-olivia-jade-something-navy.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/st3.jpeg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jakeg.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/teckin-smart-power-strip-bgr.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2037-_toy-story-4_-cast-explains-why-forky-isne28099t-named-sporky-youtube-f09f948a.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-snuggle-hold-hands-in-san-francisco-restaurant-ftr-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jacob-and-zach.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rexfeatures_10314204hj-e1561059816154.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lion-king.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/joker-movie-trailer-gq-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/aap-rocky-cannes-lions.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/logitech-harmony-remote-650.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/neil-portnow.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/weeknd-joachim-johnson-1.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screen-shot-2019-07-12-at-9.28.27-am-e1562949684853.png?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/theylive1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/neil-portnow.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michele Amabile Angermiller", "Michele'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammys-so-male-women-recording-academy-president-neil-portnow-1202679902/", "title": "2018 Grammys So Male? \u2018Women Need to Step Up,\u2019 Says Academy President \u2013 Variety", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Recording Academy president Neil Portnow at the 2017 Grammy Awards says women need to 'step up.'", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "news_keywords": "Grammy, Grammy Awards", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Grammys So Male? \u2018Women Need to Step Up,\u2019 Says Recording Academy President", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/grammys-so-male-women-recording-academy-president-neil-portnow-1202679902/", "description": "The only woman presented a solo Grammy during the awards telecast on Sunday night?
