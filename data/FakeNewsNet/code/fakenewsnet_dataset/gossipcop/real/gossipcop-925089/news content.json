{"url": "https://www.byrdie.com/celebrity-dark-circle-cures", "text": "Thanks to the rise of social media, we can now rest assured that stars indeed are just like us. They go to the grocery store! They drink wine on a weeknight! They post (too many) Snapchat videos with the dog filter! The most surprising thing we\u2019ve learned about the hallowed Hollywood elite through social media, however, is that they too struggle with the life annoyances that are dark circles and under-eye bags. Take a look at Rosie Huntington-Whiteley\u2019s Snapchat, for instance, and you\u2019ll see the pillowy-lipped model walk viewers through her entire makeup regimen, starting with a bare face.\n\nSure, her \u201cdark circles\u201d may be an entirely different league than our own (hers are barely discernible while ours may resemble craters on the moon), but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re any less attentive when she shares the concealer she swears by to conceal them. (It\u2019s Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer, $29, by the way.)\n\nWith that in mind, we scoured the internet to see what other dark-circle cures celebrities swear by. Because if Selena Gomez says an eye cream really works, and we\u2019re staring at her bright-eyed visage on the red carpet, who are we to deny our faces the same opportunity? From frozen spoons to miracle eye creams, see the under-eye cures Selena, Kate, and more swear by below!\n\nMike Pont/Getty\n\nOur contributor Lindsay Ellingson broke down her entire in-flight beauty routine for us, and it was glorious. The one thing she never travels without? Klorane\u2019s Smoothing & Relaxing Patches ($18), which tighten and brighten the under-eye area in just a few minutes. She's also a fan of the gold foil eye masks from her own brand, Wander Beauty, especially for their innovative technology. \"Similar to a space blanket that you see at the end of a marathon, the gold foil works with the warmth of your body to retain heat,\" she says.\n\n\"When your skin is warm, like when you step outside of a hot shower, you\u2019re able to absorb the maximum amount of serum.\"\n\nWander Beauty Baggage Claim Gold Eye Masks $25 Shop\n\nAmanda Edwards/Getty\n\nThe glowy-skinned Gabrielle Union has a less traditional hack for getting rid of dark circles and puffiness. \u201cI chill some tea bags\u2014right now it\u2019s Lipton\u2014and use them on my under-eye,\u201d she tells NYTimes.com. She\u2019s onto something: the caffeine, tannins, and antioxidants naturally found in tea can tighten and soothe the under-eye area.\n\nLipton Black Tea Bags $10 Shop\n\nRon Adar/Getty\n\nIf you have sensitive eyes, take a cue from Whitney Port and count frozen spoons as your (eye) saviors. \u201cMy eyes are very sensitive, so I put spoons in the freezer and then place the frozen spoons on my eyes when they\u2019re irritated or when I\u2019m tired,\u201d she tells TheBeautyBean.com.\n\nPaul Zimmermann/Getty\n\nOur immediate reaction when Kate Hudson Snapchatted a selfie of herself wearing \u201celectro-shock\u201d eye patches\u2014white, wired patches that wrapped around her ears and hung from a plug\u2014was confusion, then a ravenous desire to find out exactly what they are. Turns out they\u2019re something called electric eye patches, which contain hyaluronic acid, collagen, and other plumping ingredients. \u201cThe patch is applied to your skin and connected to an electrode to deliver heat energy to the underlying tissues and provide feedback to the device regarding skin temperature,\u201d Jessica Weiser, MD, tells People.\n\n(The WrinkleMD Hyaluronic Acid Deep Infusion System, $200, is one if you want to check it out.)\n\nWrinkleMD Wrinklemd Eye Ha Deep Infusion System $199 Shop\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty\n\nSelena Gomez spilled her beauty secrets to Into the Gloss and revealed the eye cream she calls her holy grail: First Aid Beauty\u2019s Eye Duty Triple Remedy ($36). \u201cIf you get dark circles, it\u2019s the sh*t,\u201d she says. She says she\u2019ll put it on, and it feels \u201call good and cold,\u201d and then she\u2019ll have a coffee to finish up her wake-up process.\n\nFirst Aid Beauty Eye Duty Triple Remedy $36 Shop\n\nGeorge Pimentel/Getty\n\nLast but not least, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz proved herself to be a beauty hacker after our own hearts when she revealed that though she loves eye cream (La Mer, naturally), she also uses a much budget-friendlier alternative. \u201cLucas\u2019 Papaw Ointment ($9) is my go-to,\u201d Moretz says. \u201cI cover my lips in it, and then I put it underneath my eyes. Hydration is key.\u201d BRB\u2014buying all the red tubes.\n\nLucas' Pawpaw Ointment $8 Shop\n\nDavid Livingston /Getty\n\n\"Eye masks really work for me,\" Kim Kardashian West writes on her app. \"They make me look refreshed, less tired, and more radiant.\" One of her favorites is the Instagram-popular shooting-star patches from KNC. They're infused with retinol, collagen, aloe, and hyaluronic acid to thicken the under-eye area and disguise discoloration. And of course, they make for a great selfie.\n\nKNC Beauty All Natural Retinol Infused Eye Mask $40 Shop\n\nSteve Granitz /Getty\n\nEspecially during long, dry flights, Olivia Culpo entrusts La Mer's Illuminating Gel to hydrate and plump the delicate skin surrounding the eyes.\n\nLa Mer The Illuminating Eye Gel $150 Shop\n\nMonica Schipper /Getty\n\n\"When your day starts at 4am and your kids were up in the middle of the night, the day starts with de-puffing,\" Camila Alves mused in an Instagram post. \"I love this hydro cool firming eye gel from [Skyn Iceland] as a quick fix for the day. This is NOT an ad or sponsored. I just love this thing and it works in 10 minutes!
