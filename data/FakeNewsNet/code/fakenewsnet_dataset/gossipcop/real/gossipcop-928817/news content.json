Avicii, died Friday afternoon in Oman, according to a statement from his rep. He was 28.\n\n\u201cIt is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cHe was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.\u201d\n\nOne of the most popular and successful electronic dance-music artists of all time \u2014 he scored a No. 4 hit on the Billboard 200 in 2013 with \u201cWake Me Up\u201d and regularly appeared in the Top 5 of Forbes\u2019 \u201cHighest-Paid DJs\u201d lists \u2014 he retired from live performing in 2016 at the peak of his success, citing health reasons.

That is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do.\n\nLast year I quit performing live, and many of you thought that was it. But the end of live never meant the end of Avicii or my music.

It is the beginning of something new.\n\nHope you\u2019ll enjoy it as much as I do.\u201d\n\nBergling was born in Stockholm on Sept. 8, 1989. He began DJing as a teenager and released his first single in 2007. He released a large number of singles and remixes in the following years and rapidly built a reputation as a live act. He broke through with his 2010 hit \u201cSeek Bromance,\u201d which charted in several European countries; he signed a publishing deal with EMI the same year. He explained his chosen DJ name as \u201cthe lowest level of Buddhist hell,\u201d chosen because his real name was already being used by another Tim Bergling on MySpace.\n\nHis 2011 single \u201cLevels,\u201d which was later nominated for a Grammy Award, vaulted him into the mainstream, charting in multiple European countries and topping the chart in his native Sweden. \u201cSunshine,\u201d his 2012 collaboration with David Guetta, was nominated for a Grammy for best dance recording. In September of that year, he became the first DJ to headline New York\u2019s prestigious Radio City Music Hall; at those two shows, he previewed a new song with Mike Posner titled \u201cStay with You.\u201d\n\nHis proper debut album, \u201cTrue,\u201d was released on September 2013, much of which was previewed during his headlining set at the Ultra Music Festival earlier that year. The album featured \u201cWake Me Up,\u201d a collaboration with Aloe Blacc, which topped the charts in multiple countries across the world and was No. 1 for a record 14 weeks on Billboard\u2019s Dance/Electronic Songs chart; it was also the U.K.\u2019s fastest-selling single of 2013. Other singers on the album included Adam Lambert and Audra Mae. He also worked with Madonna during this period and contributed to two songs on her 2015 album \u201cRebel Heart,\u201d although both parties seemed unhappy with the collaboration and Avicii said the final versions were quite different from his demos.\n\nThe extent of his popularity was reflected in a 2014 \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d digital short called \u201cWhen Will the Bass Drop?,\u201d with comic Andy Samberg playing a fictional mega-DJ named \u201cDavvincii\u201d (although he was made up to look more like David Guetta).\n\nHowever, as his popularity rose, his health declined. He was hospitalized in March 2014 and cancelled several tour appearances; not long after, he collaborated with Carlos Santana and Wyclef on the official FIFA World Cut Anthem \u201cWe Will Find a Way.\u201d Also that year, he produced a song on Coldplay\u2019s album \u201cGhost Stories.\u201d He released his second full-length album, \u201cStories,\u201d in October 2015.\n\nIn March of 2016, he performed at the Ultra Music Festival, premiering new material, but 10 days later announced that he was retiring from performing. He made a final live appearance in August in Ibiza. In December, he parted ways with longtime manager Ash Pournouri.\n\nIn August of 2017 he released a six-track EP entitled \u201cAvici,\u201d which he said was the first of three installments that would be his next album. He followed a month later with a full-length documentary called \u201cTrue Stories,\u201d which was largely about his retirement. In it, promoters are seen trying to convince him to continue touring, even though he\u2019s in obvious physical pain. \u201cI looked at myself like, \u2018F\u2014, you should\u2019ve really stood up for yourself more there. Come on, Tim!,'\u201d he said of the documentary to Rolling Stone in an interview published last September. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I stop the ship earlier?\u201d\n\n\u201cI needed to figure out my life,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe whole thing was about success for the sake of success. I wasn\u2019t getting any happiness anymore. Now that I have more time in the studio, I want to learn as much about other genres as possible. That\u2019s what I love the most \u2013 having a session with Nile Rodgers, for instance, and getting an understanding of music that\u2019s invaluable.\u201d\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nMusicians, Celebrities Pay Tribute to Avicii\n\nAvicii\u2019s Biggest Hits (Listen)\n\n\u2018Avicii: True Stories\u2019 Documentary Reveals Star DJ\u2019s Struggles With Health, Fame and Early Retirement\n\nAvicii\u2019s Life and Career in Photos\n\nPOPULAR ON VARIETY", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/game-of-thrones-siggraph.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dietpills_featured.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hbo-chernobyl.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10331334cg-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/9245539a-cropped-e1562834428290.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/schitts-creek-1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/ed-sheeran.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/simona-halep-5-things-to-know-ftr-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/youngdylan.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_8410877w.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/jem.jpg", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/stranger-things.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/st3.jpeg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jakeg.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/the-lion-king.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2Favicii-dead-at-28-1202772767%2F&ct=article&lob=pmc-core&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202772767&comment_count=98", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2037-_toy-story-4_-cast-explains-why-forky-isne28099t-named-sporky-youtube-f09f948a.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jacob-and-zach.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/rexfeatures_10314204hj-e1561059816154.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lion-king.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcwwd.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/premiazioni_10.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/r-kelly-sexual-assult-mug-shot.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/aap-rocky-cannes-lions.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spiderman-far-from-home.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/avicii.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/weeknd-joachim-johnson-1.jpg?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/bethany-hamilton-unstoppable-lieber-films.jpg?w=250&h=140&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/screen-shot-2019-07-12-at-9.28.27-am-e1562949684853.png?w=450&h=253&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-13-at-8.41.51-AM.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/theylive1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/avicii.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jem Aswad", "Senior Music Editor", "Https", "Twitter.Com Jemaswad", "Jem'S Most Recent Stories", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/avicii-dead-at-28-1202772767/", "title": "Avicii Dead at 28 \u2013 Variety", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Artist, DJ and producer Tim Bergling, a.k.a.
