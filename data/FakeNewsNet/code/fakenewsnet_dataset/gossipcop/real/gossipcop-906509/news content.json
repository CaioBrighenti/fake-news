{"url": "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/", "text": "#MeToo, Now What? premiered February 2018\n\nThe #MeToo movement shattered the silence and pushed sexual harassment and the lived experiences of so many women to the forefront of the national conversation. Now it\u2019s time to take that conversation to a deeper level engaging women and men from all generations and walks of life. #METOO, NOW WHAT? asks: How did we get here and how can we begin to effect positive and lasting change?\n\nOur five-part series aims to create a space for authentic and honest dialogue among women and men towards understanding, healing and reconciliation. We\u2019ll have the uncomfortable conversations \u2014 reflecting on the times in which we as individuals and as a society have been complacent, as well as the times in which we may have been complicit.\n\nBeyond the sensational headlines, #METOO, NOW WHAT? will examine many of the factors that enabled sexual harassment to endure in the workplace despite the laws that prevented it. We\u2019ll take a look at how popular culture, pay inequity and gender discrimination, and the intersecting issues of race and class affect the way society views women. We\u2019ll also explore how men can be engaged in this discussion, how some men are rethinking masculinity, and, ultimately, how we might begin to chart a path forward.\n\nWe invite Americans from all walks of life to participate in this critical conversation using the hashtag #MeTooOnPBS. On the show, we\u2019ll be talking to activists, journalists, celebrities, chefs and leaders from the worlds of media, academia, business, advertising, gaming and the service industries. Online, we hope to hear from you, too. Host Zainab Salbi says, \u201cWe need to have this conversation out of awareness and compassion and not anger if we want to create lasting cultural change.\u201d", "images": ["https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/iCG6mBT-show-mezzanine16x9-TQGKF21.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Episode%204/PBS-%23MeToo%2CNowWhat-IMG_0699--%C2%AC2018-Eric-van-den-Brulle%20(1).jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Ijeoma%20Oluo%20%201080x1080%20set%20portrait%20-2018%20Eric%20van%20den%20Brulle.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/Big%20Blue%20Live/Images/Multipage%20Site/Master/new%20itunes%20bagdge.png", "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/ http:/image.pbs.org/video-assets/ZtR5BQ5-asset-mezzanine-16x9-xnW4zsT.jpg.resize.800x450.jpg ", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Episode%204/PBS-%23MeToo%2CNowWhat-IMG_0630C--%C2%AC2018-Eric-van-den-Brulle%20(1).jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/banner-front.png", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Nadine%20Strossen%20%201080x1080%20set%20portrait%20-2018%20Eric%20van%20den%20Brulle.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/episode%205/IMG_1017C-800.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/IMG_0601C%201920x1080%202018%20Eric%20van%20den%20Brulle_square.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/P62A8693-sized.jpg__320x480_q85_subsampling-2.jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/ http:/image.pbs.org/video-assets/sU6pPIW-asset-mezzanine-16x9-nFSu7yj.jpg.resize.800x450.jpg ", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Background_v3.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Angela%20Rye%201080x1080%20set%20portrait%20-2018%20Eric%20van%20den%20Brulle.jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/ http:/image.pbs.org/video-assets/QhIAnKs-asset-mezzanine-16x9-fr5fxDZ.jpg.resize.800x450.jpg ", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/IMG_0782C%201920x1080%202018%20Eric%20van%20den%20Brulle_square.jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/ http:/image.pbs.org/video-assets/UaFCYB6-asset-mezzanine-16x9-6HZrc32.jpg.resize.800x450.jpg ", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Episode%203/John-IMG_0026C%201080x1080--%C2%AC2018-Eric-van-den-Brulle.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Episode%203/IMG_0056C-1080x1080--%C2%AC2018-Eric-van-den-Brulle.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Episode%203/IMG_9967C-C-1080x1080--%C2%AC2018-Eric-van-den-Brulle.jpg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/Program%20Site%20Graphics/Logo-Shop-PBS.svg", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/Guests/Episode%204/PBS-%23MeToo%2CNowWhat-IMG_0720C--%C2%AC2018-Eric-van-den-Brulle%20(1).jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/ http:/image.pbs.org/video-assets/fVoC6FP-asset-mezzanine-16x9-h9lQtrl.jpg.resize.800x450.jpg ", "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/ http:/image.pbs.org/video-assets/kMmFDwF-asset-mezzanine-16x9-3l4ohsd.png.resize.800x450.png ", "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/Program%20Pages/PBS-Available-on-Amazon.png"], "top_img": "https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/%23MeToo%2C%20Now%20What/iCG6mBT-show-mezzanine16x9-TQGKF21.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/", "title": "#MeToo, Now What?", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@pbs", "creator": "@pbs"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The #MeToo movement shattered the silence and pushed sexual harassment and the lived experiences of so many women to the forefront of the national conversation.
