It would be really hard for me to get to sleep and I would be so scared that I wouldn\u2019t go to my parents\u2019 room. I didn\u2019t want to tell them what was happening because I thought there was something wrong with me,\u201d she recalls.\n\nRELATED: Michelle Williams Sends Busy Philipps Hilarious Post-Surgery Gift\n\nPhilipps partnered with The Child Mind Institute for their #MyYoungerSelf campaign, which sees celebrities giving advice to their younger selves and offering hope for today\u2019s youth who struggle with mental health issues or learning disabilities. Sarah Silverman, Kristen Bell, Zoe Saldana, Gabrielle Union, and Philipps\u2019 fellow \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d alum James Van Der Beek have all participated in the campaign.\n\nPhilipps says talking about her anxiety made her realize \u201cThere is nothing wrong with me.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Meg Ryan Talks To Busy Philipps About Negative Press, Social Media And Tom Hanks\n\n\u201cOnce I was able to start talking about it relieved a lot of the anxiety. I was able to get help\u2014therapy, sometimes medication,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that either. I would\u2019ve liked to tell my younger self not to be embarrassed or ashamed, and to open up and to talk about what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThe actress concludes her video with an important message: \u201cIt feels kind of incredible to know that you\u2019re not alone.
