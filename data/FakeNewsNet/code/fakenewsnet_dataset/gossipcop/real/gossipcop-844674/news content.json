Are you ready to shine brighter and farther?\" she captioned the image.\n\nNews that the film will premiere on December 2 as part of Freeform\u2019s 25 Days of Christmas comes just over one week after Entertainment Weekly revealed a first look at Banks in the sequel, which you can see here.\n\n#LifeSize2 premieres December 2nd!\n\n\n\nAre you ready to shine brighter and farther? \ud83d\udc95 pic.twitter.com/ZVBuE12tcu \u2014 Tyra Banks (@tyrabanks) October 12, 2018\n\nJuly 27, 2018: As Lindsay Lohan prepares to make her highly anticipated return to reality television with her very own Vanderpump Rules-inspired show centred around her new Mykonos and Dubai-based beach clubs, People has confirmed that according to a representative from Freeform, Lohan will not be making a cameo in the Life Size sequel.\n\n\"Due to the production schedule for her new reality show, she wasn\u2019t available,\" confirmed the representative.\n\nJuly 10, 2018: 17 years after Disney first released Life-Size, starring Lindsay Lohan, a sequel is finally coming.\n\nPlans for a reboot of the 2000 film were first announced almost four years ago but now Freeform have confirmed the project will be coming to a small screen near you in December 2018 during its 25 Days of Christmas special. So yes, it\u2019s a wait but it\u2019s also Christmas themed, so worth it.\n\nThe original story sees Casey Stuart (Lohan) bring her doll (Banks) to life after a spell intended to bring her mother back to life goes awry.\n\nWhile Banks has taken to Twitter to confirm she's set to reprise her role as Eve and announce that filming for the sequel has begun, there\u2019s no word yet on whether Lohan will make a cameo or take on a role.\n\n\"Now filming: LIFE SIZE 2,\" wrote Banks. \"It\u2019s time y\u2019all! You\u2019ve waited long enough. Could not find one single woman more perfect to co-star with Eve than the magnificently fierce @franciaraisa. See you on @FreeformTV this holiday season! #LifeSize2 #ShineBrightShineFar.\"\n\nNow filming: LIFE SIZE 2.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time y\u2019all!

It\u2019s about figuring out what that role is. I\u2019d like it to be kind of robust. I\u2019m not looking for a Lindsay cameo, I\u2019m looking for her to have something pretty meaty in Life-Size 2, so we shall see what our writer comes up with.\u201d", "images": ["https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/billie_cover1_web-3.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red.svg", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-mobile-e28093-640-png-1.png", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-desktop-1000x56-png-1.png", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a08a8064a8de23a7a38411a6a58c7281", "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/website-banner-rh-column-300x300-png-1.png", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/nav-close.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/2953d27c2f54cc587cfdd5c73c34928d", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ee30cdf80e192b0c1cb6550d0da8d4d4", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6061b4e5c8b6b0c184d3a5690243af6d", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/67b67c9742b21a2099571b12ae3db3e7", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/92076e6bb3797c95fa8f0d706253728a", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f5cc55a12e2447d95f06030078ec0272", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a1911a6eedec5497fac8febb35a48b79", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/vogue-au-small.png", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/39caa385c1cc1c2abc0637808d387093", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a549dd1a95b2c149a9c5d210bb2ce433", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src//img/arrow-red-mobile.svg", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a26e159ece077cdcb17248d979817f80", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/google-play.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/75e7c11931fc9de1c73def2be008831f", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/bbc6face3bc7b05a947c15974d3ef5ce", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/80bf4d4f4840daab4f18df57aa7ee0a5", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/457ef75cf74d6c7992388d17238d3e97", "https://www.vogue.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-nlm-vogue/assets/src/img/app-store.png", "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f7aef56bf5aa3e4d4f8138e45413757c", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ce113f74c3b22fc0ff418b88258eb66b", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a549dd1a95b2c149a9c5d210bb2ce433", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lilith Hardie Lupica"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com.au/miss-vogue/news/lifesize-the-sequel-is-happening-and-tyra-banks-is-on-board/news-story/04186e26c268493388a0f12bbb01e36a", "title": "Life-Size the sequel is happening and Tyra Banks is on board", "meta_data": {"author": "Lilith Hardie Lupica", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue Australia", "type": "article", "title": "Life-Size the sequel is happening and Tyra Banks is on board", "description": "Filming has officially begun.", "url": "https://www.vogue.com.au/miss-vogue/news/lifesize-the-sequel-is-happening-and-tyra-banks-is-on-board/news-story/04186e26c268493388a0f12bbb01e36a", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=200", "width": 200, "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"creator": {"identifier": "vogueaustralia", "id": "vogueaustralia_id"}, "title": "Life-Size the sequel is happening and Tyra Banks is on board", "description": "Filming has officially begun.", "image": {"identifier": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=240", "src": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a549dd1a95b2c149a9c5d210bb2ce433"}, "site": "@wordpressdotcom", "text": {"title": "Life-Size the sequel is happening and Tyra Banks is on\u00a0board"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vogueatnewscorpau.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/cropped-vogue-favicon.png?w=270", "theme-color": "#000000", "google-site-verification": "1j07G6Nu2IDJrC-g23wwzTEjb-d0Va1h15olpbRuxYI", "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-15T01:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-15T01:09:52+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "application-name": "Vogue Australia", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Vogue -
