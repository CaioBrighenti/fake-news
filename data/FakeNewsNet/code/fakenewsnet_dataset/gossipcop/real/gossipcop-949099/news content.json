Perhaps the only thing that would make both shows better is if they joined forces \u2014 and because Netflix is Netflix, the streaming site offered us the crossover episode we never even knew we needed.\n\nYep, a Queer Eye and Nailed It! crossover episode exists, released with the second season of the latter, and I don\u2019t know about you, but it\u2019s the most ambitious crossover event in HISTORY. (No offense, Infinity War.)\n\nCan you believe?!\n\nIn the episode, our BFFs Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, Bobby Berk, and Karamo Brown visit the Nailed It! kitchen for a fabulous baking challenge. The guys, with the exception of Antoni (as he is tasked by host Nicole Byer and chocolatier Jacques Torres to be the guest judge) try to recreate fondant versions of themselves, and well\u2026let\u2019s just say that they\u2019re better off revamping houses and putting together outfits.\n\n\u201cThe kitchen is my sunken place,\u201d culture expert Karamo says at one point, to which Byer responded, \u201cDon\u2019t be a black man giving up in front of America!\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t want to spoil anything, so we won\u2019t tell you who wins, but we\u2019ll tell you this: It is NOT Jonathan, because his finished cupcake of Tan is a complete MESS.\n\nImage zoom\n\nI\u2019m sorry, henny, but that does not resemble a cupcake AT ALL.\n\nTrust us when we say that the Queer Eye x Nailed It! crossover event is the best 12 minutes you\u2019ll watch today. You may stream the whole episode on Netflix here or the shorter version on YouTube here.\n\nHey, Netflix, it if isn\u2019t too much to ask, can we have an entire season of this? We\u2019re pretty sure we\u2019ll have no problem watching the Fab Five banter with Nicole and nail it for hours on end.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09101322/Ariana-Grande-in-My-head-Video.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/23162824/arthur.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02104813/tgif-comedies-family-matters-e1562089707800.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/07114801/alwaysbemymaybe.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/24101622/ross-geller-e1558718192658.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/06133019/satc1.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/05144006/big-e1522964416645.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/04062130/hannah-brown-bachelorette.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/30152125/do-the-right-thing.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/14204711/whitneyhouston.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/02103650/netflix.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/09090218/gordon-e1562688256883.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2016/05/22013134/picture-of-jessica-jones-photo.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28105746/charlies-angels1-e1561744715378.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/20102635/friends-e1545330449309.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/14123931/tan-antoni-interview.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/28102729/Yung-Baby-Tate.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/01095706/melissa-mccarthy-e1562000253438.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072547/avatar-h-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/24081819/Beyonce-Coachella.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/07/02073323/Alison-Mack-NXIVM-Sex-Cult.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/19143100/queereye.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/02100024/Queer-Eye-Nailed-it.png"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/02103650/netflix.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Cord-Cruz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-queer-eye-nailed-it-crossover/", "title": "\"Queer Eye\" and \"Nailed It!\" Crossover Episode Is A Fabulous Mess", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "entertainment,Nailed It,netflix,queer eye,Queer Eye Nailed It crossover,tv shows,Entertainment,TV Shows", "news_keywords": "entertainment,Nailed It,netflix,queer eye,Queer Eye Nailed It crossover,tv shows,Entertainment,TV Shows", "description": "The \"Queer Eye\" Fab Five made a pit stop at the \"Nailed It!\" kitchen to recreate fondant versions of themselves, and the result was a beautiful mess.", "og": {"title": "Netflix has blessed us with a Nailed It and Queer Eye crossover episode \u2014\u00a0and it is a beautiful, fabulous mess", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-queer-eye-nailed-it-crossover/", "description": "Can you believe?!", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/02103650/netflix.png", "width": 775, "height": 1383}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-queer-eye-nailed-it-crossover/", "description": "The \"Queer Eye\" Fab Five made a pit stop at the \"Nailed It!\" kitchen to recreate fondant versions of themselves, and the result was a beautiful mess.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/02103650/netflix.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/netflix-queer-eye-nailed-it-crossover/", "title": "Netflix has blessed us with a Nailed It and Queer Eye crossover episode \u2014\u00a0and it is a beautiful, fabulous mess", "description": "Can you believe?!", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/02103650/netflix.png"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y0iKFD_TQjw?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
