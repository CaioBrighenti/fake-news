after she was again forced to cancel shows due to illness.\n\nThe Canadian singer \u2013 who turned 50 on Friday \u2013 is suffering from an ear condition which requires surgery.\n\nShe cancelled a series of April shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas earlier this month, but is expected to return to the venue in May.\n\nDion said she \u201ccan\u2019t wait to get back to 100%, and to see you all again\u201d in an update on Saturday.\n\nShe wrote that the influx of birthday messages had \u201ctouched me deeply\u201d and revealed she had celebrated the day with her family.\n\nDion has been suffering with a condition in her middle ear known as Patulous Eustachian tube for the past 12 to 18 months.\n\nIn recent weeks, the ear drop medications she had been using to treat the condition stopped working meaning she requires \u201ca minimally invasive surgical procedure\u201d, a statement revealed earlier this month.\n\nDion is expected to resume performances at The Colosseum \u2013 where Adele has previously watched the star \u2013 on May 22.\n\nIn January, some of Dion\u2019s shows were also cancelled because of illness.", "images":
