Even after inking the relationship -- with two tiny Grande-inspired tattoos -- the Saturday Night Live star continues to gush over the \"No Tears Left to Cry\" singer's performances just as much as any other fan, specifically her iHeartRadio's Wango Tango set on Saturday (June 2).\n\nGrande's sass level was on overdrive as she treated viewers to the first live rendition of \"The Light Is Coming,\" a feisty Nicki Minaj-assisted bop set to be included on Sweetener, the singer's upcoming fourth studio album. The SNL cast member once again proclaimed his admiration on social media by posting a still of the show on his Instagram Story shortly afterwards.\n\n\"Are u fucking kidding me !!!??\" Davidson captioned the shot, along with a string of heart eye emojis. \"So fucking lit.\"\n\nWe're inclined to agree, ever since Grande shared a snippet of the track on Twitter May 27.
