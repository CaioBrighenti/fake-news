I mean, it just remains itself,\" Her Majesty said of the diamond-encrusted crown that King George VI also wore during his coronation on May 12, 1937. \"You can't look down to read the speech, you have to take the speech up. Because if you did your neck would break, it would fall off.\"\n\nQueen Takes Train 175 Years After 1st Royal Ride\n\nQueen Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, marked the 175th anniversary of the first train journey by a British monarch with a train trip from Slough to London\u2019s Paddington Station. (Published Tuesday, June 13, 2017)\n\nShe then added, \"So, there are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise, they're quite important things.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth II Gives Rare Insight Into Her 1953 Coronation\n\nThe Queen also revealed how \"horrible\" it was to ride to the ceremony at Westminster Abbey in the four-ton gold coach.\n\n\"It's not meant for traveling in at all. I mean it's only sprung on leather. Not very comfortable. It can only go at walking pace. The horses couldn't possibly go any faster. It's so heavy,\" the Queen said.\n\nStill, the monarch rode in the Gold State Carriage for nearly five miles that day.\n\nThis is the first interview the Queen has given throughout her six-decade reign. In fact, she's the only member of the royal family who has never sat down for a formal interview.\n\n\"The Coronation\" will air in the U.S. on Jan. 14 at 8 p.m. ET on the Smithsonian Channel. It was made in partnership with the BBC and Australian Broadcasting Corporation and is part of the Royal Collection Season, a collaboration between the BBC and Royal Collection Trust.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright E!
