Farrow has accused Allen of sexually assaulting her in 1992 when she was seven years old, though he has never been charged.

Many stars, including Colin Firth and Greta Gerwig, recently said they would not work with the director again. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Hall have pledged to donate their salaries from Allen\u2019s upcoming film \u201cA Rainy Day in New York\u201d to various charities, including the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund.\n\nAlec Baldwin has also advocated for Allen, saying it\u2019s \u201cunfair and sad\u201d that actors are denouncing the filmmaker. Kate Winslet, who as recently as December sang Allen\u2019s praises, said at the London Film Critics\u2019 Circle Awards on Sunday that she has \u201cbitter regrets\u201d from working with \u201cmen of power\u201d who are associated with sexual harassment and assault.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
