Whatever you are going through, however dark it may seem, there is an undeniable truth and strength in the fact that you are not alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is piercing and the truth is what matters. The truth is none of us are alone,\u201d she said after admitting that the song brought her to tears.\n\n\u201cWe all have struggles. And as long as you never give up on yourself, light will break through the darkness,\u201d she added.\n\nKesha encouraged anyone in need to contact the hotline before Logic, joined by Alessia Cara and Khalid, performed the song. They were joined by survivors of attempted suicide.\n\nWatch a video of the performance below:\n\nRelated video: Craziest Moments At MTV VMAs\n\nCraziest Moments At MTV VMAs\n\nSupport real journalism.
