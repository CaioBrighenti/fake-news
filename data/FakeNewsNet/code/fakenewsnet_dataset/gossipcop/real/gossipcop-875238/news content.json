And while the alleged incident itself sounds upsetting if what sources say is true, cast members seem more upset that the show isn't filming.\n\nPart of that may have to do with how much money they can make off of \"Bachelor in Paradise.\"\n\nContestants on \"The Bachelor\" and \"The Bachelorette\" don't make any money for their appearances, unlike the stars of the show, who are typically paid $100,000. The real money comes after the show when they can begin making a living off of Instagram endorsements, and by going on other ABC reality shows, such as \"Bachelor in Paradise.\"\n\nNick Viall on \"Bachelor in Paradise.\" ABC/Rick Rowell\n\nAccording to Reality Steve, \"some [contestants] get paid per day they are there, some get paid per episode they're on, and some get paid a flat rate (usually alumni).\" In season one, Reality Steve alleged someone could make anywhere from \"$7,000-$15,000 total.\"\n\nAnd now there's precedent that if they become really popular, the \"Bachelor in Paradise\" contestants could become the next \"Bachelor\" or \"Bachelorette\" star themselves \u2014 that is what happened with Nick Viall, a former two-time contestant on \"The Bachelorette\" who finally got his own show on \"The Bachelor\" after making two appearances on \"Bachelor in Paradise.\"\n\nSo while the contestants are reacting to the news, it is worth keeping in mind that thousands of dollars could be on the line for them after the show has suspended filming. They could also potentially be missing out on Instagram endorsements, other reality shows, and maybe even becoming the next \"Bachelor\" or \"Bachelorette\" themselves.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59401d004cb1e454d26d0128-1334-667.png", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/58b4d463dd08953f1f8b4d3a-750-562.png"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/59401d004cb1e454d26d0128-1334-667.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Willett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/bachelor-in-paradise-paid-money-2017-6", "title": "Here's how much money the cast of 'Bachelor in Paradise' allegedly makes by appearing on the show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2017-06-13", "sailthru.date": "2017-06-13", "news_keywords": "Bachelor in Paradise, Corinne Olympios, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, Megan Willett", "sailthru.tags": "Bachelor in Paradise, Corinne Olympios, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, Megan Willett", "description": "The scandal-embroiled show pays for its drama \u2014 and a lot.
