According to a press release on Wednesday, Hefner died two days before the issue was going to press.\n\nThe magazine's latest issue now features a black-and-white photo of Hefner, shot by Larry Gordon in 1965, and the first six pages will pay tribute to the Playboy founder's life. The rest of the magazine includes interviews with Chelsea Handler, James Corden and a piece by Hefner's son, Cooper.\n\nHefner will also be honored in a forthcoming 100-plus page special tribute.\n\nPlayboy\n\nRELATED: Jared Leto to Play Hugh Hefner in Upcoming Biopic\n\nThe magazine mogul died peacefully at his home at the age of 91, and was laid to rest in a private ceremony attended by his wife, Crystal, and children at Los Angeles' Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery earlier this month.\n\nIn 1992, Hefner purchased the crypt next to Marilyn Monroe for $75,000.
