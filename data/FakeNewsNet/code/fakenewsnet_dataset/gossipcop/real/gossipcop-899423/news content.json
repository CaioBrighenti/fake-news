(Chris Pizzello)\n\nWhere are you and how did you first hear about your nomination?\n\nI am in my hotel room in New York City. I just got in last night to do \"I, Tonya\" press. So I got up very early this morning and had forgotten that this was Golden Globe morning because I was dealing with a bit of jet lag and trying to get into hair and makeup. I found out when I had just finished my segment on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d My publicist came in with a huge grin on her face and said, \"You've been nominated!\"\n\nI was so glad that they'd recognized the movie and of course, Margot. It's a really, really special morning for me and all of us. And it makes it even more special for me because of my friendship with Steven Rogers, who wrote the screenplay and wrote this part with me in mind. So it just couldn't be a more gratifying day.", "images": ["https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/lat_icons/app-bar-logo.svg?v=36", "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/_zic6WO091Yichbt2k2Ghy7q1IQ=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5995c826/turbine/la-1502988323-gm2clpsuuk-snap-image/600", "https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/tinygif.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/_zic6WO091Yichbt2k2Ghy7q1IQ=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5995c826/turbine/la-1502988323-gm2clpsuuk-snap-image/600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meredith Blake", "David Harbour Of", "Stranger Things", "In A Statement Released Monday", "Pamela Adlon", "Anthony Anderson Of 'Black-Ish' In A Statement Released Monday"], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-golden-globes-2018-nominations-ann-dowd-on-season-2-of-handmaid-s-1513017204-htmlstory.html", "title": "Ann Dowd on Season 2 of 'The Handmaid's Tale' and her 'pretty darn thrilling' Golden Globes nod", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "language": "English (United States), en-US", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2018 Los Angeles Times", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "date": "2017-12-11T18:28:00Z", "googlebot-news": "index", "twitter": {"title": "Ann Dowd on Season 2 of 'The Handmaid's Tale' and her 'pretty darn thrilling' Golden Globes nod", "image": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/_zic6WO091Yichbt2k2Ghy7q1IQ=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5995c826/turbine/la-1502988323-gm2clpsuuk-snap-image/600", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@latimes", "creator": "@latimes"}, "fb_title": "Ann Dowd on Season 2 of 'The Handmaid's Tale' and her 'pretty darn thrilling' Golden Globes nod", "og": {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-golden-globes-2018-nominations-ann-dowd-on-season-2-of-handmaid-s-1513017204-htmlstory.html", "title": "Ann Dowd on Season 2 of 'The Handmaid's Tale' and her 'pretty darn thrilling' Golden Globes nod", "image": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/_zic6WO091Yichbt2k2Ghy7q1IQ=/1200x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5995c826/turbine/la-1502988323-gm2clpsuuk-snap-image/600", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "latimes.com", "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "tag": "la-et-golden-globes-2018-nominations, TV, Nominees, Reactions", "section": "Entertainment"}, "fb": {"app_id": 119932621434123, "page_id": 5863113009}, "author": "Meredith Blake", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkidEAPHH2XE4JFGPP7WRORVLVPVPQ", "ptype": "s"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.latimes.com", "summary": ""}
