We are never going to go away!\u201d\n\nThe accolade celebrates the advancement of the band \u2013 lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn and keyboardist PJ Morton \u2013 over the past 10 years.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: You Have to Meet Adam Levine\u2019s Biggest Fan!\n\nWith five multi-platinum studio albums and more than 20 million albums and 70 million singles sold worldwide, Maroon 5 has become one of the top touring acts in popular music, as they continue to achieve worldwide success while expanding their impact on pop culture and the music industry.\n\nTeen Choice honors the year\u2019s biggest names in television, music, film, fashion and comedy. Category winners are then selected by teens themselves, who choose new award categories and favorites from the past.\n\nFROM PEN: Lea Michele Dream-Casts Her Own Real-Life Girl Squad \u2014 from

Young.\u201d Rita Ora then closed the performance with her hit single \u201cYour Song.\u201d", "images":
