Often spotted out shopping with her sister, or partying with the same group of people at London nightclubs, Pippa's good looks and sense of style earned her many fans, as well as critics. Dubbed the \"wisteria sisters,\" Kate and Pippa were criticized for what some perceived as social climbing. Seen out and about frequently, Pippa became a paparazzi favorite.\n\nIt was Pippa's sister, Kate, who changed the family's fortunes for good. As a freshman at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, Kate befriended, and began dating, a young Prince William.\n\nAfter graduating in 2008, Pippa worked at a public relations firm, then as an event planner in London. She was often spotted out at London's poshest nightclubs, and on the arm of handsome young aristocrats.\n\nRoyal Wedding\n\nThe November 2010 announcement of the engagement of Prince William and Kate Middleton caused a national frenzy in Britain. Always close to her sister, Pippa reportedly helped Kate plan many of the details of the royal wedding and the reception.\n\nBridesmaid Dress\n\nWhen the much-anticipated wedding took place at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, many eyes were on the bride's younger sister \u2014 and Pippa, as the maid of honor, didn't disappoint. Dressed in a slinky white dress by Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen, Pippa held her sister's train and chatted with Prince Harry during the televised ceremony. Her beau, stockbroker and former cricketer Alex Loudon, sat beside her in the front row at the ceremony. The rave reviews of Pippa's dress \u2014 and her figure \u2014 rivaled the enthusiasm for the bride's gown.\n\nPippa Middleton attends the British Heart Foundation: Roll Out The Red Ball at The Savoy Hotel on February 11, 2016 in London, England.
