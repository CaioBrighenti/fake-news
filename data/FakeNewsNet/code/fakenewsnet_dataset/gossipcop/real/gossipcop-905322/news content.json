The CBS television audience heard dead silence instead before he raised his arms \u2014 twice \u2014 and earned a sustained standing ovation.\n\nREAD MORE: Robert De Niro calls Donald Trump \u2018f***ing idiot\u2019 in profanity-filled rant\n\nThe legendary actor urged the audience to vote in November and lauded Springsteen for his own political commitment before the singer sat at a piano for a moving performance based on his \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d show that had him singing his classic hit, \u201cMy Hometown.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Robert De Niro apologizes to Canadians for Trump\u2019s \u2018idiotic behaviour\u2019\n\nDe Niro said of Springsteen: \u201cBruce, you can rock the house like nobody else and even more importantly in these perilous times, you rock the vote, always fighting for, in your own words, truth, transparency and integrity in government. Boy, do we need that now.\u201d\n\nThe anti-Trump sentiment swept backstage as playwright Tony Kushner and others from \u201cAngels in America\u201d spoke to reporters about its three big wins: best play revival and acting trophies for Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane.\n\nWATCH: De Niro\u2019s past criticism of Donald Trump\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Kushner said when asked about the De Niro moment, dropping an F-bomb of his own in relation to the president.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe De Niro did that,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cGood for him. I mean, it\u2019s Robert De Niro. Who\u2019s gonna argue with him?\u201d\n\nKushner went even further, calling Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cthe Hitler mistake\u201d that put a \u201cborderline psychotic narcissist in the White House.\u201d", "images": ["https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/chy102175254_high.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=276",
