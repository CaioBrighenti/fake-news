Going and running, just to run on the treadmill, wasn't my thing. I have so much respect for people that can do it, I wish I could because it looks really cool and really fun. There's always stories about cute girls in the gym, I'm just not one of those people. But I had to start boxing because I missed working on something and learning and I guess there's a little more aggression in boxing. I couldn't really get that side of me out, but I used to be able to by hitting a volleyball.
