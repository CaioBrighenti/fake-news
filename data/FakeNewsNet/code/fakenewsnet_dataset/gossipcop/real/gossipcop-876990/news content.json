Photo: Marc Piasecki/GC Images\n\nForget Kanye 2020, Kim Kardashian is ready for a younger West to assume the presidency and she\u2019s convinced that that administration could begin now. In a cover story for Harper\u2019s Bazaar Arabia, Kardashian has offered her assessment of Donald Trump\u2019s first months in office and found that a different child could prove superior. \u201cNot the president now,\u201d she said when asked who should have the power that comes with being commander-in-chief. \u201cAnyone can run the U.S. better. My daughter would be better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked so hard to get to where we were and to have so many things that we were so proud of in our country, to just literally revert backwards is the most frustrating thing,\u201d she continued. \u201cEvery single day when you can\u2019t really believe what\u2019s going on, the next day it\u2019s something else even more crazy and tragic. It\u2019s really scary, the world that we\u2019re living in now. And when you did feel safe at home, now with Trump in presidency you just don\u2019t feel safe any more.\u201d\n\nNow, though North West may be but little (she\u2019s 4), she is fierce and seemingly fit for the job. She\u2019s already media trained, having given her first presidential interview in which we learned she has impeccable music taste, loves cheese, and has LGBTQ pride even if she doesn\u2019t know it yet (her favorite color is \u201crainbow,\u201d folks). And, unlike certain heads of state, we know she isn\u2019t interested in photo ops or nepotism. One could argue she\u2019s already the first daughter. If her father really runs in 2020 \u2014 who knows which party or which policies he\u2019d support \u2014 he\u2019s going to need proper counsel. May we kindly request that Kim start priming North for a political career in 2020? By that point, North will be 7 and wiser than us all. Nori for Veep!", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-new.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/08/31/31-north-west.w330.h330.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-crawl.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-hopper-david-harbour-stranger-things-2.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Dressing-Funny-Rachel-Dratch-Tina-Fey.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-r-kelly.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-stuber.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-7-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-arti-gollapudi.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-billie-eilish-song-of-the-week.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/big-brother-sunday.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-julio-torres.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-lil-wayne.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/01/15/15-r-kelly-criminal-record.w536.h536.jpg ", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-mindhunter.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-review.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/11/11-TomKennyMemes.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-ed-sheeran-wife.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-conan-sona.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/08/31/31-north-west.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/12/12-big-little-lies.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Oliver-Jackson-Cohen.w536.h536.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/11/12-Wet-Hot-American-MidSommar.w536.h536.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/08/31/31-north-west.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dee Lockett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/kim-kardashian-north-would-be-a-better-president-than-trump.html", "title": "Kim Kardashian Thinks North West Would Make a Better President Than Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Thinks North West Would Make a Better President Than Trump", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/kim-kardashian-north-would-be-a-better-president-than-trump.html", "description": "\u201cAnd when you did feel safe at home, now with Trump in presidency you just don\u2019t feel safe any more.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/08/31/31-north-west.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kim Kardashian: North Would Be a Better President Than Trump", "description": "\u201cAnd when you did feel safe at home, now with Trump in presidency you just don\u2019t feel safe any more.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/08/31/31-north-west.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-31T12:21:36.573-04:00", "tag": "kim kardashian, donald trump, north west, kanye 2020, kanye-nori 2020", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Kim Kardashian endorses her daughter North West for president.", "sailthru.tags": "kim kardashian, donald trump, north west, kanye 2020, kanye-nori 2020", "author": "Dee Lockett", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504196496.573, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
