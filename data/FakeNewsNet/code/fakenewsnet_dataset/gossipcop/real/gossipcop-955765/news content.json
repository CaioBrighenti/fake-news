The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,\u201d he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. \u201cLet\u2019s push the envelope!! Let\u2019s make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nFigueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry\u2019s team \u2014 the winning team \u2014 at Thursday\u2019s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho.
