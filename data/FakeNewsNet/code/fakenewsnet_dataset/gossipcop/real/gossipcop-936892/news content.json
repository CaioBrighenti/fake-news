But (not unlike Harry's wife, Meghan Markle) Bonas also has an acting career. And while some royal fans felt a pang of empathy watching Bonas attend her former boyfriend's wedding to Meghan, they don't have to\u2014Bonas has some good things going, too.\n\nCressida Bonas arrives at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s royal wedding. IAN WEST Getty Images\n\nShe's reportedly just been cast in the leading role for ITV's The White House Farm Murders, a six-part series is based on a notorious 1985 quintuple murder at an Essex family home. Decades later, the tragic event receives regular press, as the accused murderer Jeremy Bamber continues to challenge his conviction from prison.\n\nBonas will play the family's ill-fated daughter. Two other familiar faces will star alongside her: Alfie Allen and Mark Addy, who portrayed Theon Greyjoy and King Robert Baratheon, respectively, in Game of Thrones.\n\nCressida Bonas (left) attends Princess Eugenie\u2019s wedding. Max Mumby/Indigo Getty Images\n\nThough the actress may never live down her association with Prince Harry, Bonas certainly seems to have moved on. She seemed perfectly at ease attending Harry and Meghan's wedding, and even blogged about the experience. \"Last weekend I attended the royal wedding,\" she wrote in a diary entry for the Spectator. \"The invitation clearly stated that guests must wear hats. Yikes. I opted for a minimal feathered number\u2014and can only hope I got it right.\" Not even a mention of her former beau!\n\nBonas also made an appearance at the year's second royal wedding, between Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank. Eugenie and Cressida are longtime friends; it was actually Eugenie and her sister Beatrice who introduced Bonas to Prince Harry in the first place. So while she may not marry a Prince, Bonas still gets to run in royal circles\u2014and that's really the best part anyways.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cressida-bonas-attends-the-ee-british-academy-film-awards-news-photo-919970316-1541086787.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.686xh;0,0.0614xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960036232-1527267086.jpg?crop=0.776xw:0.259xh;0.0833xw,0.00534xh&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-960034246-1526725345.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0168xh&resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cressida-bonas-attends-the-ee-british-academy-film-awards-news-photo-919970316-1541086787.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.686xh;0,0.0614xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chloe Foussianes", "News Writer", "Chloe Is A News Writer For"], "canonical_link": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a24514427/cressida-bonas-prince-harry-ex-girlfriend-tv-show-white-house-farm-murders/", "title": "Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry's Ex-Girlfriend, Lands a Leading Role In New TV Series", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#BE3E19", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Town & Country", "title": "Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry's Ex-Girlfriend, Lands a Leading Role In New TV Series", "description": "Who needs a Prince when you have your own TV series?", "url": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a24514427/cressida-bonas-prince-harry-ex-girlfriend-tv-show-white-house-farm-murders/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cressida-bonas-attends-the-ee-british-academy-film-awards-news-photo-919970316-1541086787.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.686xh;0,0.0614xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 526594570689062, "pages": 344794953432}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TownandCountryMagazine", "modified_time": "2018-11-01 07:24:33", "published_time": "2018-11-01 07:24:00", "section": "Arts & Culture"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TandCmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cressida-bonas-attends-the-ee-british-academy-film-awards-news-photo-919970316-1541086787.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.686xh;0,0.0614xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "musQPiBADe3f4WpT4JNcg9uUChC3qnOhhPLSR4n1urM", "title": "Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry's Ex-Girlfriend, Will Star In New TV Series on ITV", "description": "Cressida Bonas has reportedly just been cast in the leading role for ITV's \ufeff\ufeff'The White House Farm Murders.' \ufeffThe six-part series is based on the notorious \ufeff1985 quintuple murder at an Essex family home.", "keywords": "cressida bonas, cressida bonas prince harry, cressida bonas royal wedding, cressida bonas acting, The White House Farm Murders", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cressida-bonas-attends-the-ee-british-academy-film-awards-news-photo-919970316-1541086787.jpg?crop=0.732xw:1.00xh;0.189xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Leisure,leisure,arts-and-culture", "sailthru.date": "2018-11-01T19:24:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cressida-bonas-attends-the-ee-british-academy-film-awards-news-photo-919970316-1541086787.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.686xh;0,0.0614xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cressida-bonas-attends-the-ee-british-academy-film-awards-news-photo-919970316-1541086787.jpg?crop=0.732xw:1.00xh;0.189xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry's Ex-Girlfriend, Lands a Leading Role In New TV Series", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541071440.0, "source": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com", "summary": ""}
