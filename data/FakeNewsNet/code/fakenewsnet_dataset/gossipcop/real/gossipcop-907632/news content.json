According to a statement from the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner, obtained by Variety, the musician was taking several medications, including Fentanyl, oxycodone, Xanax, Restoril, and Celexa. Prince died of an overdose of the painkiller Fentanyl in April of 2016, according to an autopsy report.\n\nThe coroner\u2019s report lists Petty\u2019s official cause of death as \u201cmultisystem organ failure due to resuscitated cardiopulmonary arrest due to mixed drug toxicity.\u201d\n\nPetty was found at his unresponsive at his Malibu home on Oct. 2 and was taken to the UCLA Medical Center, where he was placed on life support. However, he could not be revived and died hours later.\n\nIn their statement, Petty\u2019s family named a litany of health problems the musician faced, \u201cincluding emphysema, knee problems and most significantly a fractured hip.\u201d The hip injury worsened, the family explained, while Petty was on his most recent tour.\n\n\u201cOn the day he died he was informed his hip had graduated to a full on break and it is our feeling that the pain was simply unbearable and was the cause for his over use of medication,\u201d the statement went on.\n\n\u201cOn a positive note we now know for certain he went painlessly and beautifully exhausted after doing what he loved the most, for one last time, performing live with his unmatchable rock band for his loyal fans on the biggest tour of his 40 plus year career,\u201d it concludes. \u201cHe was extremely proud of that achievement in the days before he passed.\u201d\n\nLike most rock musicians who came up in the 1960s and \u201970s, Petty experimented with drugs and alcohol \u2014 marijuana is prominent in the photos from his and the Heartbreakers\u2019 1976 debut album, and he told biographer Warren Zanes that he\u2019d faced challenges with cocaine use (particularly in the 1980s), alcohol and, in the wake of his 1996 divorce from Jane Benyo, heroin. He said he became clean in 2001.\n\nPetty was laid to rest in a private funeral in Pacific Palisades, Calif., on Oct. 16.
