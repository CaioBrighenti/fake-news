Like, incredibly wrong. After accidentally killing a male stripper, the friends try hard to cover up the crime and manage to get even closer in the process. If you\u2019ve ever seen the movie Very Bad Things, it seems to follow a similar pattern. But this time, the focus is around a group of women.\n\n\"It seems almost sort of pass\u00e9 that to say that is a 'ladies movie,'\" Johansson said to E! News. \"Once we can accept that women are funny and that we allow ourselves to talk about taboo subjects and take the stigma off of them, then I see it's a lot more inclusive environment.\"\n\nYes. Yes indeed. And, Johansson and her cast are definitely ready to prove (not like we even need proof, because, come on) that women can be incredibly funny.\n\nIn fact, the humor is what lead Johansson to sign onto the movie.\n\n\"What really appealed to me is that the script is so damn funny and it made me laugh out loud and I don't think that's ever really happened to me before,\" she said.\n\nIf you need a few more laughs in your life, Rough Night opens in theaters on June 16th.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg",
