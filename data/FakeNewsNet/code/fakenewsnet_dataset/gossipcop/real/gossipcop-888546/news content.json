The 25-year-old former gymnast, who represented the United States at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and came home with a gold and three silver medals, decided to share the video because \u201cwe felt like a lot of people go through this.\u201d The nearly 21-minute video starts off with Johnson crying tears of joy and revealing that she is pregnant. Her husband, former NFL player Andrew East, tells his future unborn child, \u201cIf you are on the way, I love you. I have no idea who you are, what you are, or what you\u2019ll be like, but I\u2019m pumped to meet you.\u201d Johnson gives her husband a pair of Converse baby sneakers and tells him that she is pregnant before they give each other a big hug. But then came the news no expectant mother ever wants to hear.After she experienced bleeding, Johnson went to the doctor\u2019s office, where the doctor confirmed the \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d winner was miscarrying but that it\u2019s not her fault. \u201cSo, it\u2019s been a roller coaster of a few days. We just got back from the doctor and I\u2019m no longer pregnant. Somehow, I lost the pregnancy already. It sucks. It\u2019s definitely no fun, guys \u2026 and having a doctor confirm that we miscarried doesn\u2019t feel good,\u201d Johnson said in the video. \u201cI\u2019ve cried enough today, I don\u2019t need to cry anymore.\u201d Johnson uploaded the video Saturday morning, and it\u2019s already been seen more than 100,000 times as of late Saturday afternoon.In the caption, she wrote: \u201cThe past 48 hours have been some of the happiest, scariest, and saddest times of my life.My husband Andrew and I found out that we were unexpectedly pregnant, only to find out hours later some tragic news. I have been crying more than I ever have, but am still optimistic for what is next.\u201d", "images": ["https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/htv_default_image/kcci/logo.png", "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shawn-johnson-still-1508620208.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shawn-johnson-still-1508620208.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Kirkpatrick", "Https", "Www.Facebook.Com", "Digital Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.kcci.com/article/shawn-johnson-reveals-she-suffered-miscarriage-in-heartbreaking-video/13064545", "title": "Shawn Johnson reveals in heartbreaking video she suffered miscarriage", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#2c2c2c", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.kcci.com/article/shawn-johnson-reveals-she-suffered-miscarriage-in-heartbreaking-video/13064545", "site_name": "KCCI", "title": "Shawn Johnson reveals in heartbreaking video she suffered miscarriage", "description": "Iowa\u2019s golden girl, Shawn Johnson, revealed she recently suffered a miscarriage in a heartbreaking and emotional video posted Saturday on YouTube.", "image": {"identifier": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shawn-johnson-still-1508620208.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.kcci.com/article/shawn-johnson-reveals-she-suffered-miscarriage-in-heartbreaking-video/13064545", "site": "@KCCINews", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "kcci", "ipad": "kcci"}, "id": {"iphone": 505215818, "ipad": 505215818, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcci"}, "url": {"iphone": "kcci://content/13064545", "ipad": "kcci://content/13064545", "googleplay": "kcci://content/13064545"}}, "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shawn-johnson-still-1508620208.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "fb": {"app_id": 239632779417960, "pages": 20435490078}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/kcci8", "modified_time": "2017-10-23T23:10:55.147763Z", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/", "published_time": "2017-10-21T21:41:00Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "Custom"}, "google-site-verification": "UVKNeynGqg9sbZeZRmZMIt3uUI00kt2Ds8P6OtrGzsA", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=505215818, affiliate-data=1001lp8, app-argument=canonical", "msvalidate.01": "A645064CC349FEE2894B433087AB1839", "title": "Shawn Johnson reveals in heartbreaking video she suffered miscarriage", "description": "Iowa\u2019s golden girl, Shawn Johnson, revealed she recently suffered a miscarriage in a heartbreaking and emotional video posted Saturday on YouTube.", "keywords": "peoplenow, TV, Entertainment/Celebrity News, sports", "news_keywords": "peoplenow, TV, Entertainment/Celebrity News, sports", "sailthru.contentid": 13064545, "auto-publish": "never", "sailthru.author": "Alex Kirkpatrick", "author": "Alex Kirkpatrick", "sailthru.image.full": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shawn-johnson-still-1508620208.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shawn-johnson-still-1508620208.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=50:50", "date": "2017-10-21T21:41:00Z", "datepublished": "2017-10-21T21:41:00Z", "datemodified": "2017-10-23T23:10:55.147763Z", "category": "Custom", "sailthru.tags": "news,custom"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/BidMbVRT8NU"], "publish_date": 1508622060.0, "source": "https://www.kcci.com", "summary": ""}
