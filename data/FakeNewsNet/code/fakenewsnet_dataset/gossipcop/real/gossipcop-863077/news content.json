The 20-year-old was rushed to the hospital for an emergency C-section after discovering her baby was breech \u2014 but that\u2019s not the first time a Duggar woman has faced challenges bringing a child into the world. Here\u2019s a look back at some of their most intense labors.\n\nMICHELLE\n\nPerhaps the most harrowing birth experience in the family was when matriarch Michelle, now 51, welcomed her youngest child, daughter Josie, nearly three months premature on Dec. 10, 2009. Born at 25 weeks by emergency C-section after Michelle was diagnosed with preeclampsia, Josie weighed only 1 lb., 6 oz. (Michelle\u2019s condition was discovered when she was admitted to the hospital to evaluate pain related to a gall bladder problem. Preeclampsia causes high blood pressure, which meant an emergency C-section was needed to ensure the elevated blood pressure would not be detrimental to her or the baby.)\n\nEight days later, Josie\u2019s bowel perforated. The micro-preemie was rushed from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock, Arkansas, the hospital where she was born, to Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital, her parents at her side. At the time, her physician Dr. Robert Arrington, co-director of the neonatal intensive care unit, told PEOPLE that Josie \u201cdeveloped a spontaneous bowel perforation.\u201d She responded to placement of an abdominal drain, plus antibiotics, and did not require an open operation \u2014 wonderful news for her frightened parents.\n\n\u201cJosie is walking a daily tightrope to keep her vitals stable and the nurses and the whole team here has been wonderful,\u201d said Jim Bob at the time. \u201cYears ago, a baby this small wouldn\u2019t have lived an hour. We are so grateful for the ability to help her.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is incredible what the doctors and nurses can do to save the life of this little person,\u201d added Michelle.\n\nAfter nearly four months in neonatal intensive care, Josie left the hospital \u2014 only to be rushed back a few days later after her vital signs dropped. She finally returned home for good two months later, once she had grown to a \u201cchunky\u201d 9 lbs., 1 oz.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so happy that she\u2019s doing so well,\u201d Michelle told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cShe\u2019s finally home, home, home. She has a double chin now. It is so precious.\u201d\n\nJILL\n\nJim Bob and Michelle\u2019s daughter Jill, 26, welcomed her first child with husband Derick Dillard, 29, on April 6, 2015 \u2014 after close to three days in labor with intermittent contractions that sometimes were right on top of one another, within a minute apart.\n\nJill shared the intimate details of her son Israel David\u2019s birth with PEOPLE exclusively. Her water broke in the early hours of Saturday, April 4, and the Duggar family \u2014 including Michelle and sister, Jana, 28 \u2014 all pitched in to help her during labor. Though Jill was hoping for a natural delivery at her home in Rogers, Arkansas, Israel\u2019s birth \u201cdidn\u2019t go as expected.\u201d\n\nAfter her March 24 due date passed, Jill\u2019s water finally broke 41 weeks and five days into her pregnancy, but complications followed. The mom-to-be tested positive for strep B, a common bacteria that can be transferred from mom to baby during birth, and began taking antibiotics via an IV. After 20 hours in labor and little progression, Jill saw a faint stain of meconium (the earliest waste of an unborn infant, often a sign of fetal distress) and decided it was time to move to the hospital.\n\nOnce there, Jill initially declined Pitocin (a hormone that greatly speeds up labor) and pain medication \u2014 but after 70 hours in labor, the baby had flipped into a transverse breech position (sideways and upside down), was experiencing irregular heart rates and had not yet descended. Upon hearing the doctors\u2019 concerns, the couple decided to move forward with a C-section and finally welcomed their long-awaited 9-lb., 10-oz. baby boy.\n\n\u201cI love our birth story because it bonded us so well,\u201d said Jill at the time. \u201cHaving him here \u2014 it\u2019s worth all of it. I wouldn\u2019t do anything differently.\u201d\n\nJill and Derick welcomed their second child, son Samuel Scott, on July 8, 2017. After 40 hours of labor he was delivered via C-section at the hospital, weighing 9 lbs. and 10 oz.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a level of ease that comes with your second pregnancy,\u201d Jill told PEOPLE before Samuel\u2019s birth. \u201cDerick and I have been down this road together, so we\u2019re comfortable. I\u2019m just going to see how it goes, try to be healthy and prepare as much as I can. But this time I know that labor is unpredictable.\u201d\n\nJESSA\n\nJill\u2019s sister Jessa, 25, welcomed her first child with husband Ben Seewald, 22, on Nov. 5, 2015. Originally due to deliver on Nov. 1 (coincidentally her one-year anniversary with Ben), Jessa went through 10 hours of contractions that almost forced her to change her plan of having an all-natural home birth.\n\n\u201cLabor is hard,\u201d she later told PEOPLE. \u201cIt was very intense, very long. Everything was different than I expected. I said, \u2018That\u2019s it! I\u2019m done! I am going to the hospital and I\u2019m going to get an epidural.\u2019 They asked me if I really wanted to do that and I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t, but I do.\u2019 I wanted to try natural if at all possible.\u201d\n\nTheir son Spurgeon Elliot finally arrived, weighing 9 lbs. and 11 oz. \u2014 but their joy was soon interrupted by a surprisingly scary moment as Jessa began bleeding so much that her midwife became concerned. Michelle called 911, and the new mom was rushed to hospital. After nearly fainting, Jessa had to undergo a blood transfusion and stay overnight. (Her son was later brought to her side.)\n\n\u201cI had dreamed about those first moments, getting to breastfeed right away, all that \u2014 and so when I had to go to the hospital, it was a shock,\u201d she admitted.\n\nBut looking back on the nearly 48-hour delivery, Jessa was all smiles.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s really ours,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is so amazing. He\u2019s a miracle.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Gideon! Israel! Spurgeon! Your Official Guide to the Next Generation of Duggars\n\nJessa had a much more relaxed experience welcoming her second child, son Henry Wilberforce, on Feb. 6, 2017. Opting once again for a home birth and enlisting the same midwife and assistant, Jessa\u2019s water broke just before midnight on Feb. 5, and within two hours she was experiencing strong contractions.\n\nThe TLC star later told PEOPLE she and her husband were \u201csurprised at how fast it went,\u201d and baby Henry was born at 4:26 a.m., weighing 8 lbs., 11 oz. \u2014 arriving so quickly that Michelle and Jana nearly missed the birth.\n\n\u201cThey came at the very end,\u201d recalled Jessa. \u201cI was already pushing when they walked in the door!\u201d\n\nJOY-ANNA\n\nThe youngest Duggar mom, Joy-Anna, welcomed her first child with husband Austin Forsyth on Feb. 23: a healthy baby boy named Gideon Martyn Forsyth. Like her sister Jessa, Joy-Anna was set on a home birth.\n\nRELATED: Joy-Anna Duggar Gave Birth in a Hospital Instead of at Home \u2014 Why Home Births Can Be Risky\n\n\u201cI decided to have a home birth, just because I know that it\u2019s more comfortable being at home,\u201d she explained on Counting On. \u201cI really wanted to at least try it, and we\u2019re only about 30 minutes from the hospital, so it\u2019s not too bad in case of an emergency or a change of plans.\u201d\n\nBut after being in labor for over 20 hours at home, Joy-Anna\u2019s midwife determined the baby was breech. She was rushed to the hospital, where she learned that she needed an emergency C-section. \u201cHuge\u201d baby Gideon arrived at 3:39 p.m., measuring 22 inches long and weighing 10 lbs., 3 oz.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d said new dad Austin. \u201cGod is good.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got Austin\u2019s nostrils,\u201d added Joy-Anna. \u201cWe are doing well. Love you guys, thank you for your prayers. We are so happy that our little one has finally arrived and we\u2019re parents.\u201d", "images":
