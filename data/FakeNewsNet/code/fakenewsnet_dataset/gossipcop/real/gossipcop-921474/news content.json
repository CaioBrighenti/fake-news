Even though they had their fair share of struggles, the two were a hilarious pair that always managed to keep things real.\n\n\n\nWhen they split up for a second time in July of 2015 after photos emerged of Scott partying on a yacht with his ex-girlfriend Chloe Bartoli, you probs shed a tear.\n\nEven though you loved Scott, you hated Scott, and you loved to hate Scott, some part of you hoped that he would get his act together and find happiness someday. And that joy appeared to come in the form of 19-year-old model Sofia Richie.\n\n\n\nHere's the history of their relationship...\n\nJune 5, 2019\n\nCelebrities CANNOT stop getting married these days! Seriously, it seems like every day there is a new rock to admire or a new white dress to check out. I'm not complaining, I love a good celebrity wedding, but this most recent engagement rumor is still pretty shocking.\n\nThat's right, according to Us Weekly, Scott and Sofia \"have talked seriously about getting engaged.\" The two have been dating for almost two years and at this point, they reportedly \"look at each other as life partners.\"\n\nI know what you're thinking: where is Kourtney and is she OK? Well, apparently she's is more than fine with this news! A source told Us that the couple has Kourtney's \"full support.\" Apparently it helps that \"Sofia is really so good with his kids and she has a good friendship and relationship with Kourtney.\"\n\nOK, this news is nice and all, but am I the only one who assumed that Kourtney and Scott would eventually get back together?! I mean they have three gorgeous kids together, and astrologically, they're EXTREMELY compatible, while Sofia's chart just doesn't mesh as well with Scott's.\n\nStill, if this is happening, I'll jump on board, especially if they film the wedding for an ep of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 29, 2019\n\nThe love triangle between Kourtney, Scott, and Sofia continues to get more complicated as Kourtney and Scott discuss their meeting with a healer in Bali where they learned that they are soulmates. Obviously, this freaked Scott out a little considering the fact that he is dating Sofia Richie.\n\n\"I don\u2019t really know what to think. I\u2019m in another relationship,\" he said on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Obviously Khlo\u00e9 was concerned about that too. \"If I was Sofia, I would be so insecure,\u201d she told Scott. \"I don\u2019t care how confident you are. It\u2019s weird if you\u2019re Sofia.\"\n\nScott revealed that Sofia is OK with her boyfriend's relationship with Kourtney. \"I mean, Sofia knew going into this that I was extremely close with Kourtney,\" he said. \"She was like, 'Listen, I will never get between you and your family and your children. Just speak to me and make me comfortable.'\"\n\nStill, Scott wasn't sure how his girlfriend would react to the \"soulmate\" news. \"I definitely don\u2019t want to disrespect my relationship with Sofia because it means a lot to me,\" he said. And even if they aren't really soulmates, Scott still cares a lot about his ex and prioritizes her needs. \"Whether Kourtney and I are soulmates or not, I feel like I owe a lot to Kourtney for the times that I missed when I wasn\u2019t the best partner to her. So I feel like I will forever be making up for that lost time for the rest of her life.\"\n\nFinally, the exes were able to talk about the whole situation and come to a conclusion. While they are no longer together, they have reached a \"more transparent phase\" in their relationship. \"I don\u2019t know what the definition of soulmate is, but Scott and I, we\u2019re going to be in each other\u2019s lives forever,\" Kourtney said. \"We are soulmates, in a sense. No matter what, whether we\u2019re ever together or not.\"\n\nApril 25, 2019\n\nIt's safe to say that Kourtney and Scott have an extremely complicated relationship. Despite the fact that they have been broken up for a few years now, Kourtney has admitted that she wants to have another kid with Scott, and now she's saying he's her soulmate...\n\nIt all went down when the famous fam went to Bali together, which will play out on an upcoming episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. All the sisters met with a healer while on the vacation, but while Kim and Khloe's experiences sounded pretty strange (Kim had to cut her hair and Khlo\u00e9 got her knee sucked), Kourtney's was the weirdest by far.\n\n\"Scott came in, and the guy was basically saying that in a past life that we were together, and that we\u2019re soulmates,\" Kourt told her sisters. \"So he was like 'You have to decide if you want to be together or not be together.'\"\n\nWild, right? Well, apparently Khlo\u00e9 and Kim agree. \"I'm surprised from Kourtney's recap,\" Khlo\u00e9 says in her interview. Meanwhile, Kourtney is just sitting their smiling after dropping that MAJOR piece of information. She doesn't confirm that, yes, she and Scott are soulmates, but she doesn't deny it either. She's just sitting there like:\n\nE!\n\nSo, what does this mean for the future of Kourtney and Scott? And what does Sofia think about all of this? Honestly, who the heck knows.\n\nMarch 10, 2019\n\nScott and Sofia have a lot of haters. People are always coming after them because of their age difference, Scott's past, and their obsession with spon con. I mean, did you see how they celebrating Valentine's Day?\n\nLike any other celebrity, Sofia is probably constantly getting hateful comments left on her Instagrams regarding her relationship, but this time she actually responded to one. Instagram user, Amy, commented on a photo of Sofia, leaving a very strange message: \"Leave Scott alone and face your future.\"\n\nOK, let's pause for a sec because this comment is honestly confusing af. Amy is saying leave Scott alone, so does that mean that she's team Scott and thinks Sofia is bad for him? Or is she looking out for Sofia, but just wording it in a weird way? And then the whole \"face your future\" thing is super creepy. Overall, a weird comment.\n\nAnyway, Sofia was not having it, so she commented back, writing, \"Leave me alone and face your future,\" which is honestly the perfect comeback and makes a lot more sense than the original comment, if you ask me.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nScott and Sofia are spending more time together on vacation and they also have a special guest joining them.\n\nScott recently posted about their vacation in Cabo and Kourtney Kardashian is also there to take some time with them.\n\nPenelope, Reign, and Mason are also there and they even had a special movie night on the beach.\n\nLooks like there's not drama between Kourt and Sofia after all.\n\nNovember 2018\n\nThings might be on the rocks between Sofia and Scott. To start, Scott is completely absent from Sofia's Instagram account during the month of November. Most of Sofia's pics show her jet-setting around the world, hanging with her squad, and spending some quality time with her dad, Lionel.\n\nBut Sofia does make one appearance on Scott's IG page. On November 17, the two shared a couch (and a pic together). Sofia seems to be reading on an iPad as Scott posts a promo-y caption: \"Wondering how long it\u2019s gonna take before she steals my hoodie.\" Other than that, it looks like Scott spent a lot of time with his kids in November. He posted a video and two pics of the kids around Thanksgiving.\n\nEarlier in the month they were spotted together during a Derby Day in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nWhile it seemed everything was going as planned for the couple, something else must have happened between them as Sofia was seen wiping away some tears as she argued with Scott, according to People. The two of them left right after their fight.\n\nAs for Kourt, she seems to be moving on, too. She is most recently linked to Grownish star Luka Sabbat. You can read all about their whirlwind fling here.\n\nOctober 2018\n\nSofia starts off the Halloween season with a sexy AF and super suggestive pic of herself in bed. The image features Sofia smoldering in a skin-tight, spaghetti strap onesie (VERY Kardashian of her) as she sits in a boudoir (I'm assuming it's a hotel and not their bedroom?) looking longingly at Scott, who can be seen in the mirror's reflection. She captioned the pic: \"The man in the mirror \ud83d\ude0d\"\n\nThings got interesting a few weeks later after Scott was seen vacationing with Kourtney and her sisters for a family vacation in Bali. While many thought that Sofia would be there, it turns out that she didn't make an appearance. Some fans were starting to believe that Sofia and Scott broke things off and he was back together with Kourt.\n\nHowever, after spending a couple of days in Bali, Scott posted a cute picture of him and Sofia together in Singapore, putting breakup rumors to rest.\n\nInstagram\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nThis month, we get a true glimpse into Scott and Sofia's relationship.\n\nDespite the fact that the two have been dating for over a year, a sneak peek for a Keeping Up with the Kardashians episode revealed that he's apparently thinking of having another baby with his ex, Kourtney!\n\n\"So, Scott just texts me that he wants to have another baby with Kourtney,\u201d Kim tells a friend in the clip \u201cI think he just wants one more, and she wants one more.\u201d\n\nSimple enough, right? Except for the fact that both Scott and Kourtney are in relationships (Kourtney was dating Younes at the time, and she's now linked to Luka Sabbat).\n\nApparently, Kim doesn't see that as a roadblock, she has a solution. \"They don\u2019t even have to have sex. It could be IVF.\" Kim decides to email the rest of the family to help encourage the two to go for another kid. She believes it makes sense that all of Kourtney's kids should have the same father.\n\nHmmm, we wonder what Sofia thinks about all of this.\n\nAnd as for Sofia, we learn a little more about her this month, as well.\n\nAfter reports emerge stating that Richie has a rule where she will not talk about Scott in interviews, her resolve is put to the test.\n\nIn an awkward AF interview with Australia's The Morning Show, Sofia was more or less forced to talk about Scott as the interviewers tried to insert his name into almost every single question they asked. They even went as far as calling out the fact that she doesn't like to talk about him on camera.\n\nThe host said: \"Are you happy answering all these questions? Because when we want to talk to you, people invariably want to bring up your relationships and stuff with your dad and with your sister as well. Does that ever get tiring, do you wish we wouldn't ask that? Or you're happy for us to sit here and ask you those questions?\"\n\nSofia totally kept her cool, saying \"I mean, I can't deny the fact that that's my life. By the way, that's been my life forever, it's nothing new to me. I'm not upset that I have to answer these questions, but there are moments that I have where I'm like, I want to be my own person and I want to stand as my own person. And I think that's actually what drives me to work and do my own thing, and to want to make my own mark. I be want to seen as my own person, even though I have all these amazing people in my life that I love so much.\"\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\n#EXCLUSIVE: Model @sofiarichie is in Australia for the very first time and meeting some very lucky fans at @WindsorSmith in Bondi Junction! \u2728 #WSxSOFIA #TMS7 pic.twitter.com/EtKRM5mORY \u2014 The Morning Show (@morningshowon7) September 6, 2018\n\nSo, what's Scott up to while all this is going on? Well, according to a recent clip from Keeping Up With The Kardashians, he's fighting with Kourtney about some Sofia stuff. Apparently, Scott introduced their kids to Richie without checking in with Kourt first, and she was NOT having it.\n\n\"It's called giving someone a heads up and having a respectful conversation, giving someone the respect,\" Kourtney tells Scott in the tense clip. \"I make sacrifices all the time and you're not following through with the things that you say you're gonna do. Then you just go and do whatever you want and I'm not okay with it.\"\n\nBut Scott's def not on the same page as Kourtney, saying, \"I think you expect a lot from a lot of people. Not always can your expectations always be met, even though people are trying their hardest to please you.\"\n\nWatch it all go down below:\n\nJuly 2018\n\nThe couple recently hit up Greece together and Scott shared a very interesting goodbye as they headed back to the States.\n\nScott posted the scandalous photo of Sophia in a very teeny black thong while the couple seemed to take in the sights together. She also wore a matching black bikini top and a crossbody that helped cover part of her behind.\n\nInstagram\n\nLooks like the couple are doing just fine, even after Scott's big cheating scandal the month before.\n\nJune 2018\n\nOn June 1, photos surface that show Scott partying it up in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for the release of Kanye's new album, Ye. In the photos, Scott has his arms around a woman with dirty blonde hair who is NOT Sofia, according to TMZ. People at the event also claim that Scott appeared drunk.\n\nSo where was Sofia that night? The 19-year-old model posted a pic from Nobu restaurant in Malibu.\n\n\n\nBut bad news travels fast. Upon learning on Scott's behavior with this mystery woman, Sofia reportedly called it quits.\n\n\u201cHe cheated on her, and she confronted him,\u201d a source close to the couple told People.\n\nThe 19-year-old model has also reportedly moved out of Scott's home. Sources said she was looking for a place of her own.\n\n\n\nSources also said that, Sofia's dad, Lionel Richie, was not heartbroken over the split. \u201cLionel hasn\u2019t approved of the relationship since the beginning,\u201d an insider told People. \u201cHe joked about it publicly but he was livid.\u201d\n\nBut, after all the drama, it seems Scott and Sofia are still going strong. According to TMZ, they're very much still together. Although Sofia wasn't happy about the photo of Scott and the mystery woman, she hasn't ended their relationship just yet. But wasn't Scott telling everyone at the party he was single? A source told the site that was just the alcohol talking...\n\nIn response to TMZ's report, Scott posted a screenshot of the news story on his Instagram stories and wrote, \"We had no idea we even broke up but thanks for thinking of us.\" So guess everything's good, right?\n\nInstagram\n\nSofia also got on IG Stories to set everyone straight. She posted a pic of her and Scott cuddling on a plane with the text \"whole heart\" written across the image. Then, she posted a second image that said, \"Don't believe the internet.\"\n\nThe couple even took things to the next level by reportedly moving in together. Sofia is currently staying at Scott's house, with a source confirming to People, \"Sofia again lives with him. Everything seems good now. It\u2019s back to normal.\"\n\n\n\nMay 2018\n\nSofia spends more and more time with Scott's 3 kids Mason, Penelope, and Reign. \u201cIt helps that Kourtney now trusts Sofia,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE. \u201cThe kids are allowed to spend time with her. Sofia likes having them and helps Scott. So far, the kids are giving Kourtney good reports about Sofia.\u201d\n\n\u201cSofia has shown over and over again that she is willing to stay with Scott even when things are not great \u2014 but Scott is doing well lately.\"\n\nThe two go on vacation with the kids for Scott's birthday. Sofia posts this beach pic with the caption: \"Happy Birthday babe! Thank you for being you. Love you.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Sofia and Scott are seen babysitting the kids while Kourtney is off on a romantic getaway with boyfriend and model Younes Bendjima.\n\nMarch 2018\n\nThe two are snapped grabbing frozen yogurt together.\n\nFebruary 2018\n\nScott confirms his relationship with Sofia on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. During the episode, Kris grills Scott on his new relationship, and it gets awkward AF.\n\nHere's their dialogue:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you dating?\u201d Kris asked.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Scott replied.\n\n\u201cAre you dating one person? Just one?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s something new,\u201d Scott responded.\n\n\u201cAre you going steady?\u201d Kris continued.\n\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s what the kids are calling it,\u201d Scott responded.\n\n\u201cIs it Sofia?\u201d Kris asked, finally cutting to the chase.\n\nJanuary 2018\n\nSofia and Scott live it up in Mexico, chilling on yachts and making out in pools.\n\n\n\nDecember 2017\n\nThe couple waste no time getting out and about with their relationship. The two are spotted strolling on a beach in Miami on December 6. That same night, they make their first public appearance as a couple at DuJour magazine\u2019s Art Basel kickoff party. There, they kiss all night.\n\nA few days later, Sofia and Scott share a passionate kiss at Sugar Factory in Miami Beach in front of all their friends AND paparazzi. They are making their love KNOWN.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nIt seems like Scott might still be using dating apps even though he's official with Sofia, and someone has serious feels about it. And no, it's not Sofia. Kylie Jenner's now-ex Tyga gets a hold of a screenshot of Scott's profile on the dating app Badoo and posts it on his Instagram story. Interesting.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nLionel Richie tells Us Weekly that he's \u201cscared to death\u201d about Sofia's new relationship. But that doesn't seem to bother the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star. A source later says: \u201cScott wasn\u2019t bothered by Lionel\u2019s recent comments.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd, tbh, the two don't look bothered as they make out on a jet ski in the middle of the ocean that same month.\n\nSeptember 2017\n\nAfter months of dating rumors swirling around the pair, Sofia and Scott make it Instagram official on September 24 when Scott posts some PDA-packed pics on Instastories.\n\nInstagram\n\nThe two also post a picture of a dessert that says: Congratulations Scott and Sofia (except Sofia is spelled wrong, lol). And they even go a step further by posting a video of them kissing while the dessert is placed in front of them. Reports say that the two are \"inseparable.\"\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\nScott is 15 years older than Sofia.\n\nThis news comes shortly after Scott's whirlwind spring and summer, during which he gets cozy with a few different women (including Bella Thorne).", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-1556213748.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-1556213748.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alison Caporimo", "Tamara Fuentes", "Carolyn Twersky", "Digital Deputy Editor", "As The Digital Deputy Editor Of Seventeen", "I Help Our Site Director Oversee Content On The Site", "Across All Of Our Social Media Platforms.", "Entertainment Editor", "Tamara Fuentes Is The Entertainment Editor For Seventeen", "Covers Celebrity News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/a21050217/scott-disick-sofia-richie-relationship-timeline/", "title": "Scott Disick and Sofia Richie's Relationship Timeline", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Seventeen", "title": "UMMMMM Scott Disick and Sofia Richie Have Reportedly \"Talked Seriously About Getting Engaged\"", "description": "And apparently Kourtney is OK with it!", "url": "https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/a21050217/scott-disick-sofia-richie-relationship-timeline/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-1556213748.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 112965278727107, "pages": 8028997215}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/seventeen", "modified_time": "2019-06-05 05:49:04", "published_time": "2019-06-05 05:48:00", "section": "Celeb Couples"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seventeen", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-1556213748.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "uQMdsrh02fvs6lNVGcB04v0iEtK1MpGMQ3UF-Fy0RVI", "title": "Scott Disick and Sofia Richie's Relationship Timeline - Sofia Richie and Lord Disick Age Difference", "description": "If you loved Scott on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' then you wondered what would become of his love life after his split with long-tim ex Kourtney.
