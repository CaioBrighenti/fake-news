Thanks to social media, the annual event has become a #Blackmoment, where everywhere comes dressed in their Sunday best. And whether you\u2019re there or not, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time just scramming through the gram, getting your life from these looks. And honestly, the flicks are amazing. There\u2019s a bit of church, a dash of brunch, and a whole lot of Black excellence. Hands down, it\u2019s the best place to catch some dope fashion looks while sitting out on the lawn, sipping on your champagne. And I love any event that turns into a Black family reunion! If you need some fashion inspo for the summer, just look at these fire fits spotted this weekend at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic sponsored by Hublot.\n\nThis stylista gave us floral-themed goodness for the day, pairing a beautiful purple floral dress with some pink flowers.\n\nView this post on Instagram #VeuveClicquotPoloClassic \ud83c\udf7e A post shared by The Non-Influencer (@jaidus) on Jun 2, 2018 at 4:46pm PDT This green pantsuit looked so chic and dapper on this fashionisto, who gave us color for the summer and spring. I never thought I\u2019d like a green pantsuit as much as this, but I am diggin\u2019 this vibe.\n\nView this post on Instagram \ud83c\udfc7\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd42 A post shared by \u2654Jamaican Canadian\u2654 (@winnieharlow) on Jun 2, 2018 at 3:52pm PDT Oh, and don\u2019t get it twisted: Celebs come out to the function as well! The beautiful Winnie Harlow was spotted in New York, sporting off those long legs in this dope fit. Winnie never disappoints!\n\nView this post on Instagram Always Classic. \ud83d\udc98 #veuveclicquot #veuveclicquotpoloclassic #vcpoloclassic A post shared by t. (@terahmascara) on Jun 3, 2018 at 3:11pm PDT This boss babe wore this beautiful pastel, off-the-shoulder flowy dress, decked out with some nude heels and a matching nude purse.\n\nEven the men came out in their full fits for the polo event! This all-white fit is absolutely dapper, and paired with an orange linen blazer? Yes, Black king. YAAASS.\n\nView this post on Instagram Today was a beautiful day at the polo! \ud83d\udc0e\ud83c\udfd1\ud83c\udfc6 A post shared by faroukjames (@faroukjames) on Jun 3, 2018 at 10:11am PDT Even the kids came to slay! Farouk James came in this dapper polo fit, and with all that flowy hair? This is a model pose. Put it on a cover!\n\nView this post on Instagram 2018 Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic \ud83c\udf7e #veuveclicquot #veuveclicquotpoloclassic #blackexcellence #style #fashion A post shared by \ud83d\udde3 Speak Life (@forever_mistah) on Jun 2, 2018 at 9:05pm PDT These men look so chic in their fits. This all-white LV-esque fit is fire, but also this two-piece set is giving me everything for that beautiful, green lawn. Also everyone had one of these fab yellow umbrellas, and now I\u2019m wondering where I can get one.\n\nView this post on Instagram Champagne & Polo #veuveclicquotpoloclassic #vcpoloclassic A post shared by Artisan (@amorunique__) on Jun 3, 2018 at 7:45am PDT This look is honestly something so unexpected to me, and that\u2019s why I love it! Who says you can\u2019t pair metallics with non-metallics, or that something with a bit of gold can\u2019t go with silver? Fashion is whatever you want it to be, shine girl!\n\nView this post on Instagram A lovely day to visit the grounds. #VCpoloclassic #goodvibes #summertime A post shared by Brie (@briepyt) on Jun 3, 2018 at 6:51am PDT How mesmerizing is this African-print sundress? Not only is it a super simple fit that can easily be dressed up and down, but it\u2019s just\u2026such an understated statement-maker. This Queen brought it home!\n\nView this post on Instagram Bubble gum \ud83c\udf6d \ud83c\udf6c #vcpoloclassic #fashion A post shared by J'Lysa Wilson (@jlysa_monet) on Jun 2, 2018 at 6:13pm PDT I promise, no more pink suits, but I told y\u2019all it\u2019s a vibe! This longline linen pantsuit is a look that you can wear with the blazer, or you can pair the blazer with some nude heels and wear it as a dress (or maybe some pants underneath.) Love everything about the pink suits coming out to play!", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035391&c4=", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=187138648481959&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic.jpg?w=1024&h=575", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/madamenoire/images/madamenoire_logo_white.svg", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/madamenoire/images/madamenoire_logo.svg", "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://madamenoire.com/1027837/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic/", "title": "22 Of The Flyest Fits We Saw At The 2018 Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic", "meta_data": {"fb": {"admins": 100006356380901, "pages": 123136324375898}, "google-site-verification": "89cYy4uYOnrle-D3H3SPnHJySu32IytBEKjsv1_skZo", "y_key": "637ec967f3cf29ad", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article-type": "slideshow", "description": "It's a bit of church, a dash of brunch, and a whole lot of Black excellence when it comes to the fashion at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "22 Of The Flyest Fits We Saw At The 2018 Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic", "url": "https://madamenoire.com/1027837/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic/", "description": "There\u2019s a bit of church, a dash of brunch, and a whole lot of Black excellence.", "site_name": "MadameNoire", "image": {"identifier": "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1", "width": 560, "height": 320}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-04T19:54:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-07T17:09:27+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@MadameNoire", "site": "@MadameNoire", "text": {"title": "22 Of The Flyest Fits We Saw At The 2018 Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic.jpg?w=640", "src": "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic.jpg?w=560&h=320&crop=1"}, "card": "summary", "title": "22 Of The Flyest Fits We Saw At The 2018 Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic", "description": "There's a bit of church, a dash of brunch, and a whole lot of Black excellence."}, "sailthru.date": "2018-06-04 15:54:49", "sailthru.title": "22 Of The Flyest Fits We Saw At The 2018 Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic", "sailthru.tags": "Fashion, Fashionable Looks, Roundup, VC Polo Classic, Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic", "sailthru.description": "There's a bit of church, a dash of brunch, and a whole lot of Black excellence.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic.jpg?w=50", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://madamenoire.com/1027837/veuve-clicquot-polo-classic/?ia_markup=1"}, "cXenseParse": {"ion-publishdate": "06-04-2018", "ion-author": "jame1993", "ion-categories": "Slideshows", "ion-tag": "Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic", "ion-post": "gallery"}, "application-name": "MadameNoire", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Black Women's Lifestyle Guide | Black Hair | Black Love", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://madamenoire.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/cropped-tab-logo.jpg?w=16", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://ionemadamenoire.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/cropped-tab-logo.jpg?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528142089.0, "source": "https://madamenoire.com", "summary": ""}
