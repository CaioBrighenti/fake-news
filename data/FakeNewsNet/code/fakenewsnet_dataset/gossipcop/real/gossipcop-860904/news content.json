Miami Herald File\n\nThe first Gloria Fajardo \u2014 \u201cBig Gloria,\u201d as her family affectionately called her \u2014 loved song and dance and was once selected to be actress Shirley Temple\u2019s double in Hollywood before the Cuban Revolution took root in 1953.\n\nThe next Gloria Fajardo, the one who, as Gloria Estefan, sang for U.S. presidents, at the Olympics and Super Bowl, and sold millions of records worldwide, credits the first for some of those accolades.\n\n\u201cMy mother was my professor,\u201d Estefan told El Nuevo Herald in 2008. \u201cWhen I was a child, she sang me lullabies so I\u2019d go to sleep. That\u2019s how it began.\u201d\n\nMeeting the president. From left to right: President Bill Clinton, Gloria Fajardo, her daughter Gloria Estefan and Emilio Estefan, in 1997.

The Musical: The Story of Emilio & Gloria Estefan,\u201d a biomusical that will debut its road version at downtown Miami\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts in October.\n\nAs on the Broadway stage, in a role originated by Tony-nominated actress Andrea Burns, Fajardo\u2019s own story should resonate in Miami. It\u2019s a tale of drama, laughs and a big heart.\n\n\u201cBig Gloria\u201d \u2014 Fajardo \u2014 died Tuesday night. She was 88.\n\n\u201cTonight at 8:19 p.m. we lost my beloved mother, the inimitable Gloria Fajardo,\u201d Estefan wrote on Instagram. \u201cShe went peacefully surrounded by her daughters, grandchildren, son-in-laws, niece, three loving caregivers, extended family and her most trusted friends. I will miss her every moment of every day and I thank her for being the incredible mother, woman and role model that she was to so many people.\u201d\n\nSaid son-in-law Emilio Estefan: \u201cShe was such an incredible woman, full of love and energy. And she worked so hard for the kids and her husband. She was so proud of him for being in the military. She loved this country. She came looking for freedom and attended to her family all the way to the end.\u201d\n\nLate in life, at 87, Fajardo had taken up rapping in a series of amusing family videos that her granddaughter, musician Emily Estefan, posted on her Instagram account with the #Rapuela hashtag.\n\nRap grandma. Fajardo was a sensation. Traditional and social media loved the story.\n\nemily grandma rap\n\nBut it was just a lark, an abuela having fun with her family that made #Rapuela charming and guileless. More often, Fajardo could be spotted around Miami supporting her more famous kin: clutching her heart in mock \u2014 or maybe not \u2014 fear as her daughter did somersaults while suspended by cables 30 feet in the air for a music video in 1998. Or, more recently, beaming with pride at her granddaughter\u2019s major concert debut at Festival Miami in February. Or, in March, at the opening of Emilio Estefan\u2019s new midtown Miami restaurant, Estefan Kitchen.\n\nFajardo\u2019s own dreams of a performing career were quashed by a disapproving father. Instead of taking Hollywood\u2019s offer to double for Temple she became a schoolteacher, wife and mom.\n\nFajardo, and her husband, Cuban volleyball champ and policeman Jose Manuel Fajardo, with their eldest daughter, Gloria, came to Miami in 1959 on a $21 plane ticket after Castro took power. While training the exile brigade\u2019s tank division for the Bay of Pigs invasion, her husband was captured by his cousin, a member of Castro\u2019s army, and imprisoned in Cuba for nearly two years.\n\nIn Miami, Gloria Fajardo, was left to raise their daughter in an apartment near the old Orange Bowl. By Christmas 1962, her husband was released and back in Miami. The family grew with the addition of daughter Rebecca. Jose Fajardo joined the U.S. Army and volunteered to go to Vietnam in 1967.\n\nGloria Estefan (left) with her younger sister Becky and their mother, Gloria Fajardo, in a file photo. Courtesy of Gloria Fajardo Miami Herald file\n\nDuring his two-years of duty, Jose was exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange. Gloria Fajardo taught at James H. Bright/J.W. Johnson Elementary School in Hialeah while her eldest daughter tended to her ailing father\u2019s care. He died in 1980.\n\nWhen Gloria Estefan was 17 she met Emilio Estefan, a percussionist who had a local band. When she approached her mother to tell her she wanted to join them as a singer, Fajardo had a quick response:\n\n\u201cI said no. No!\u201d Fajardo said in a mother-daughter interview on TV\u2019s \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d in 2015. Her fear? \u201cThat she would forget about her education,\u201d she told the Herald in a 1995 Mother\u2019s Day feature.\n\net interview\n\nEmilio Estefan would have to win her over, too, a process that took about 12 years and was dramatized in \u201cOn Your Feet!\u201d\n\nThe musical\u2019s depiction of the estrangement was accurate, Emilio said recently. In 1990, Gloria\u2019s back was fractured when a semi truck plowed into the Estefans\u2019 tour bus on a snowy road in eastern Pennsylvania. Her mother, home in Miami, heard a preliminary news report and three words caught her attention: \u201cGloria. Estefan. Died.\u201d\n\nFajardo flew to her daughter\u2019s bedside. Gloria had received 48,000 cards and faxes from around the world and 4,000 floral arrangements \u2014 gestures of love she later credited with speeding her recovery. But the everlasting gift was having her mother back. Fajardo\u2019s initial misgivings proved unfounded as she found pride in her daughter\u2019s successes: \u201cShe graduated from the University of Miami with a major in psychology \u2014 and a major in music,\u201d Fajardo told the Herald in 1995. \u201cShe\u2019s proud of her Cuban roots and she shows it in her music.\u201d\n\nAlso, \u201cHe was the best thing to happen to her \u2014 eventually,\u201d Fajardo, a twinkle in her eye, said of Emilio on the \u201cET\u201d segment.\n\nIn the clip, Estefan looks to her mom and says, \u201cI never grew up thinking there was nothing a woman couldn\u2019t do. My mother went out and worked. She put us through prep school. She renewed her credentials as a teacher and never sat on her laurels.\u201d\n\nFajardo\u2019s survivors include her daughters Gloria Estefan and Rebecca Fajardo; grandchildren Nayib and Emily Estefan; and great-grandson Sasha Argento Estefan-Coppola.
