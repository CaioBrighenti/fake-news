Milo Ventimiglia may be everyone\u2019s favorite TV dad now, but he made his fair share of mistakes and bad decisions back in the day. And now he\u2019s \u2018fessing up to one particularly icky act at Disneyland when he was 12.\n\nThe This Is Us star wore a Mickey Mouse t-shirt for his appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday, which he explained by saying, \u201cI grew up in Orange County, so I grew up going to Disneyland all the time. And I just woke up, and I was like, \u2018I kinda want to roll with Mickey today.'\u201d\n\nAsked about his favorite memories of the \u201chappiest place on Earth,\u201d the 40-year-old had a rather gross confession to make.\n\n\u201cWhen I was 12, I was there for my birthday, and I was allowed to take two friends \u2014 I think it was Aaron Steger and Jeremy Rex,\u201d he began. \u201cOne of them had a good idea while we were on the Skytram, which is this cable that runs over Tomorrowland and connects a bunch of those.\u201d\n\nDisneyland\u2019s Skyway permanently shut down in 1994, due to metal fatigue from its 38 years in operation. But Ventimiglia thinks that he and his pals might have had something to do with the ride\u2019s demise, too. \u201cIt was one of those places that you\u2019d go and you\u2019d fall in love, but you\u2019d also go and get in real trouble,\u201d he told Kimmel. And get in trouble he did.\n\n\u201c[The ride is] not there anymore, probably for this very reason,\u201d Ventimiglia said. \u201cWe were on the car ahead of my mom and dad and my sisters, and as we were going, one of my friends \u2014 I don\u2019t know who it was \u2014 had the great idea to play a game called \u2018Spit on Someone and Try and Hit Someone.'\u201d Ew.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re spitting over the edge, like, \u2018Oh, wow! I hit a bald dude!\u2019 Twenty feet before you finish, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re watching us. Just be cool. Be cool.'\u201d\n\nApparently, their efforts to \u201cbe cool\u201d didn\u2019t fool anyone. When the ride came to an end, a park employee asked the kids to wait while he spoke to Ventimiglia\u2019s parents. By the time the birthday boy\u2019s dad returned, the party was definitely over. \u201cIt was done. It was done. We went home. That was it. No spitting at Disneyland,\u201d the actor recalled. (That\u2019s probably a good rule for everyone to remember.)\n\nAs for Ventimiglia, he learned something else about Disneyland from his unfortunate experience: \u201cUm, there\u2019s cameras everywhere.\u201d\n\nHave you ever gotten in trouble at a theme park?
