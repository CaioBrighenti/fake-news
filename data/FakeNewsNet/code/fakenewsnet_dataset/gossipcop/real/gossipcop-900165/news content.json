The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills pal shared the news on Instagram alongside a photo of herself after a procedure to treat the cancer.\n\n\"Thank you Dr. Beth Karlan for removing those pesky cancer cells. You are Amazing! This is my second cancer diagnoses. Thank God We found it early,\" she wrote, pointing out that she was being treated for squamous cell carcinoma, which is a form of skin cancer. *Early detection is key. My cancer was removed and I'm resting at home. Ladies listen to your bodies. If something doesn't seem right go for a checkup. Don't put it off. Annual check ups are important.\"\n\nIn 2013, Camille was diagnosed with Stage 2 endometrial cancer and underwent a hysterectomy. She has since become a vocal advocate for spreading awareness about the disease. In September 2016, The Daily Dish spoke to her about her work to helping to spread the word.\n\n\"Right now I'm just working to promote awareness for below the belt cancers,\" Camille said, specifically mentioning cervical cancer, which she said is \"so prolific out there with young women.\" She added, \"I just feel my responsibility as a cancer survivor [is] to go out there and let people know what the symptoms are for [Endometrial Cancer]. So I do that through my social media feed, from speaking at different events from the patients' perspective ... I'm very, very passionate about it, as you can tell. Early detection is key and if I can help anybody, just one person, it means the world.\"\n\nCamille revealed back in October she was engaged to lawyer David C. Meyer; more on him, below.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/10/dish-103117-camille-grammer.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=8qj_CxiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2017/11/dish-111717-kelsey-camille-grammer.jpg?itok=fhUSopT9", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/12/dish-121417-camille-grammer.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/captain-sandy.jpg?itok=qXjF-_oI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/dorit-kemsley-morgan-stewart-look-alikes_0.jpg?itok=uElmmY9J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/barbara-luann-rhony.jpg?itok=lOYMeBeH", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/rhop-904-candiace-dinner-party-explosion_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=sLRmUfZw", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/225/655/190710_3986181_What_You_Didn_t_See_Ashley_Jacobs_Do_at_the_.jpg?itok=6y25G9ie", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/field_season_cast_photo/2019/01/rhobh_s9_2560x1440_nologo.png?itok=5stkedqg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2016/01/dish-012116-camille.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/cynthia-kenya-kandi.jpg?itok=b8xgPLPA", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/327/663/190703_3983178_Is_Craig_Conover_Really_Over_Naomie_Olindo_.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/briana-ryan-culberson-grocery-shopping.jpg?itok=QiQLmgVL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/1021/703/190709_3985566_Andy_Cohen_Reacts_to_Lisa_Vanderpump_s_Absen.jpg?itok=lNfk2wvQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/tinsley-mortimer-reality-tv.jpg?itok=K4fcZgBt", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/755/619/190627_3980046_Sonja_Morgan_on_Ramona_Singer___She_s_Very_H.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-07/below-deck-med-403-joao-cries-over-brooke_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/dorinda-luann-friendship.jpg?itok=_aGuNqe_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/148/263/190625_3978632_Dorit_Kemsley_on_Camille_Grammer_s_Accusatio.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/12/dish-121417-camille-grammer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jocelyn Vena"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/camille-grammer-opens-up-about-her-second-cancer-diagnosis", "title": "Camille Grammer Opens Up About Her Second Cancer Diagnosis", "meta_data": {"title": "Camille Grammer Diagnosed with Cancer for Second Time Details | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "Camille Grammer has confirmed that she was recently treated following being diagnosed with cancer for the second time.
