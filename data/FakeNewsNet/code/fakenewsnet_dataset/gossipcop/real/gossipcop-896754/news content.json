After being asked by Staub in a previous episode to apologize to Christine and Jillian, the Standing Strong author shows up this week ready to make amends.\n\n\u201cCan the universe erase \u2018prostitution whore\u2019 from memory sake\u2019s?\u201d Staub tells audiences in the clip. \u201cNo. I can\u2019t make it right for my kids. I\u2019ve tried. But now that Teresa and I have reconnected, I feel like it\u2019s not my job to do that anymore. I feel like she really needs to make it right.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Danielle Staub (left) and Teresa Giudice Mike Pont/Getty; J. Kempin/Getty\n\nWhile Giudice arrives at Staub\u2019s house willing to talk, Staub\u2019s eldest is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cChristine is not willing to sit down,\u201d Staub explains to Giudice. \u201cShe\u2019s still hurt from the whole thing and she\u2019s like, \u2018No, absolutely not. I don\u2019t believe anybody\u2019s changed.\u2019 But Jillian\u2019s really good at listening. When it\u2019s her turn to speak, she likes to be heard. \u2026 They\u2019re two different people.\u201d\n\nViewers will have to wait until the full episode to see if there\u2019s reconciliation. But in October, Staub opened up to PEOPLE exclusively about the pain her girls went through since the show\u2019s premiere in 2009.\n\n\u201cThey have been really bullied and tortured based on what the perception of me was made out to be,\u201d said Staub, who returned to RHONJ this season (season 8) for the first time since leaving in season 2. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve any of the things that society did to them. Maybe I did, maybe I didn\u2019t \u2013 but my kids definitely didn\u2019t deserve any of that.\u201d\n\nShe went on to give examples of the torment they received.\n\n\u201cWe would all be hurtled rolling around with our stomachs in our hands based on something somebody would say, scream, or post and then tag my daughters in,\u201d Staub recalled. \u201cWe were terrified sometimes to walk out of the door. Sometimes, it was too exhausting to go out to dinner knowing I would be met with dozens of people who would approach me and call me names. There\u2019s only so many times you and your kids can hear that in a day.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Danielle Staub Has Forgiven Teresa Giudice for Calling Her a \u2018Prostitution Whore\u2019 8 Years Ago\n\nBoth Christine and Jillian appeared to have emerged from the tough times stronger, with Staub gushing \u201cthey are stellar human beings.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo manage to come out of it as beautifully and graciously as both my kids have is a estimate to who they really are,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are really good people and very smart.\u2019\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/59d6486f5205aabdbf65fd1a39fa97ee?s=300&d=blank&r=g",
