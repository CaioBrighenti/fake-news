{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLOW_(TV_series)", "text": "American comedy-drama television series\n\nGLOW is an American comedy web television series created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch.[1] The series revolves around a fictionalization of the characters and gimmicks of the 1980s syndicated women's professional wrestling circuit, the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (or GLOW) founded by David McLane.[2] The first season consists of 10 episodes[3] and was released on Netflix on June 23, 2017.[4] On August 10, 2017, Netflix renewed the series for a second season of 10 episodes, which premiered on June 29, 2018.[5] The series was renewed on August 20, 2018 for a third season, which is scheduled to premiere on August 9, 2019.[6]\n\nPremise [ edit ]\n\nIn Los Angeles in 1985, Ruth Wilder, a struggling actress, auditions along with many other women in a fledgling professional wrestling promotion called the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW). She is at odds with GLOW's director Sam Sylvia due to her tendency to overact. When Ruth's former best friend, retired soap opera actress Debbie Eagan, arrives at the ring, their confrontation promises to either make or break the show.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nGuest [ edit ]\n\nElizabeth Perkins as Birdie\n\nIn addition to Kia Stevens (who has wrestled as Awesome Kong in TNA, and as Kharma in WWE) in a main role, several professional wrestlers made cameos throughout the seasons. These include John Hennigan as Salty \"The Sack\" Johnson, a trainer who appeared in the first episode of Season 1; Tyrus and Carlos Edwin, who played Carmen's wrestler brothers; Joey Ryan as a wrestler known as \"Mr. Monopoly\", and Ryan's real-life wife and wrestler Laura James played his valet, \"Crystal\"; Alex Riley played a wrestler known as \"Steel Horse\"; Brooke Hogan as night club manager Amber Fredrickson; Chavo Guerrero Jr. as Chico Guapo; and Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian as unnamed wrestlers. Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and Gorgeous George appear in archived video footage in episodes 1 and 4.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nThe idea for the series came when Flahive and Mensch, who at the time were looking to make a new female-centric show, came across the 2012 documentary GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.[18][19] Before this, neither woman had heard of the GLOW wrestling promotion, and they became intrigued by the premise of producing a fictionalized version of it.[19] Both women found the storyline intriguing as a way of exploring the aftermath of the 1970s Woman's Liberation Movement, with Flahive telling Rolling Stone, \"We wanted to look back on the 1970s, coming out of the women's movement, and into the 1980s, and ask the question: Did it work? Did things get better?\"[18] To this end, it was important for the series to maintain a tension between whether the league was exploiting women or empowering them.[18]\n\nUrsula Hayden, the owner of the GLOW company, served as a consultant on the series and helped Flahive and Mensch with creating the show. Hayden was also on the original 1980s promotion as Babe, the Farmer's Daughter.[20]\n\nChavo Guerrero Jr. of the famous Guerrero wrestling family also served as a consultant on the series and helped train the actresses. His uncle Mando Guerrero had served in the same role for the original series.[21]\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nThe series was shot on several locations in Los Angeles; mainly in the San Fernando Valley. Chavo's Boxing Gym, which is GLOW's training grounds, was a combination of two locations: the interior was a studio set while the exterior was the rear of the San Fernando Masonic Lodge. The Pink Motel in Sun Valley was used as a stand-in for The Dusty Spur Motel, GLOW's sleeping quarters. Other notable locations include the Mayan Theater and the Hollywood Palladium.[22]\n\nPrincipal production on season 2 commenced in October 2017.[23]\n\nMarketing [ edit ]\n\nFor the Spain Market, Netflix Espa\u00f1a released a series of promo videos featuring singers Marta S\u00e1nchez and Vicky Larraz. The first video, titled \"No Controles\", features S\u00e1nchez imitating Ruth's imaginary wrestler scene from the first episode. The second video has S\u00e1nchez and Larraz squaring off in the ring.[24][25]\n\nFor the Brazil market, Netflix Brasil released a promo video featuring singers Gretchen and Rita Cadillac auditioning for GLOW.[26]\n\nFunko will release Pop! Vinyl figures of Ruth and Debbie in mid-2018.[27]\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nThe series features several songs from the 1980s, as well as tracks from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.[28] The episode 1 opening theme for Seasons 1-2 is \"The Warrior\" by Scandal.\n\nSeason 1 songs\n\nSeason 2 songs\n\nQuiet Riot's cover of \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" was used for the Season 1 trailer, while \"Maniac\" by Michael Sembello was used for the Season 2 trailer. Songs covered by the cast include the Thompson Twins' \"Hold Me Now\" and Barbra Streisand's \"This Is One of Those Moments\".[28]\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally released 1 10 June 23, 2017 ( ) 2 10 June 29, 2018 ( )\n\nSeason 1 (2017) [ edit ]\n\nNo.\n\noverall No. in\n\nseason Title Directed by Written by Original release date 1 1 \"Pilot\" Jesse Peretz Liz Flahive & Carly Mensch June 23, 2017 ( ) Ruth Wilder, an actress struggling to find work, receives an invitation for an audition from her casting director.

GLOW fully owns its campiness and its showy aesthetics, but it\u2019s smart and subversive underneath the glitter.\"[33]\n\nThe series received mixed reactions from some of the original GLOW wrestlers. Jeanne Basone, who wrestled in the promotion as \"Hollywood\", commented that \"Some of the training and the gym and the outfits they get correct.\" Patricia Summerland, who played \"Sunny the California Girl\" in the promotion, saw Marc Maron's character Sam Sylvia as a stark contrast to original GLOW director Matt Cimber.
