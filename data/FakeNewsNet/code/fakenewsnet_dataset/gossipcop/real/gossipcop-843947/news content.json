Cooper was so committed to the project that he logged hundreds of hours learning to play the guitar and sing well enough to perform at Coachella and Glastonbury without being booed offstage. He analyzed his dreams, re-purposing certain images and ideas for art. He used his own pain and addiction\u2014which he has been reluctant to discuss in interviews\u2014to anchor his heart-aching role as an addict who, in spite of his artistic talent, is broken inside. He spent hours interviewing Lady Gaga with his co-writer Eric Roth to ensure that her character, Ally, was authentic to Gaga\u2019s own struggles. He filled his cast with people who meant something special to him\u2014including his own ear doctor! He incorporated subtle, sweet homages to previous versions of Hollywood\u2019s favorite love story. As Taffy Brodesser-Akner wrote for The New York Times, \u201cEvery detail of [the film] comes from a true thing\u2014something he\u2019s learned, something he\u2019s seen, something he knows for sure.\u201d\n\nAs a public service to better understand Cooper and his magnum opus, we compiled some of the Easter eggs, homages, and Bradley-isms that the star-slash-director lovingly planted in his version of A Star Is Born. To paraphrase the \u201cShallow\u201d lyrics belted out by Cooper\u2019s Jackson and Gaga\u2019s Ally at a stadium mic: we\u2019re off the deep end; watch as we dive in.\n\nA Judy Garland Homage\n\nGarland\u2019s starring role in 1954\u2019s A Star Is Born earned her an Oscar nomination. And in the early moments of Cooper\u2019s remake, Lady Gaga pays subtle tribute to her predecessor by humming \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d It is during this riff that the movie\u2019s title appears in klieg lights\u2014an aesthetic nod to the remakes before it.\n\nThe Drag-Bar Significance\n\nEach A Star Is Born features a different meet-cute for its lead characters. After Gaga told Cooper about her early days performing in drag bars in Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, Cooper decided to set the couple\u2019s consequential meeting at a drag bar\u2014a kind of tribute to his leading lady\u2019s early days and her gay fan base. As Gaga said at the Toronto Film Festival, \u201cI make a joke sometimes: behind every female icon is a gay man. I really wouldn\u2019t be here without the gay community, what they have taught me about love and acceptance and bravery.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb791f2e5ae6a094d001a6a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/JacksonSeesAlly.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7c42e2b57202d9836ffc2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/LadyGagaNose.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7b62e2b57202d9836ffb9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/streisandwedding.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bace4fcb2ab083a47a5bfa4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Eddie-Vedder-Bradley-Cooper-A-Star-Is-Born.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7d7c02b57202d9836ffe4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gaga%252520hat.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5baa3de987834306acdc66a4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lady-gaga-a-star-is-born-premiere.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7c0e92b57202d9836ffbe/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/StreisandFaceTouching.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d276636e0bb1eb13a6a32b/1:1/w_80%2Cc_limit/JULIE_H8A7858.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb79e0ad23564139e45cfa7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/AStarIsBornBath.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bad1fcb2b57202d9836fd7e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/A-Star-is-Born-JM-Review.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7b652d23564139e45cfb2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/CooperGagaCake.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7d996e5ae6a094d001ab6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lady-cooper-bradley-cooper-a-star-is-born.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7a07f2b57202d9836ff81/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/BradleyMeetsGaga.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b9687fe6b621e4e8595dfd1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/a-star-is-born-gaga-and-cooper-tiff.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb78fe3d23564139e45cfa0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/JudyOnstageStar.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7da166e085a486b37c2ba/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/a-star-is-born-easter-eggs-a.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb79bfd2b57202d9836ff78/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/JudyGarlandMakeup.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7c57f2b57202d9836ffc5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ASIB-FP-3508%252520(1).jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb79b326e085a486b37c27b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/OriginalEyebrows.gif"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7d996e5ae6a094d001ab6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lady-cooper-bradley-cooper-a-star-is-born.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Julie Miller", "Paul Chi", "Julie Mille"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/a-star-is-born-original-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-easter-eggs", "title": "A Star Is Born: The Easter Eggs Bradley Cooper Hid in His Lady Gaga Remake", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Including homages to previous A Star Is Born films, the friends he cast, and the real-life inspirations behind the movie\u2019s best moments.", "keywords": "a star is born,lady gaga,bradley cooper", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "Including homages to previous A Star Is Born films, the friends he cast, and the real-life inspirations behind the best moments.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7d996e5ae6a094d001ab6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lady-cooper-bradley-cooper-a-star-is-born.gif", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "A Star Is Born: The Easter Eggs Bradley Cooper Hid in His Lady Gaga Remake", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/10/a-star-is-born-original-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-easter-eggs"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Including homages to previous A Star Is Born films, the friends he cast, and the real-life inspirations behind the best moments.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb7d996e5ae6a094d001ab6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lady-cooper-bradley-cooper-a-star-is-born.gif?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "A Star Is Born: The Easter Eggs Bradley Cooper Hid in His Lady Gaga Remake"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
