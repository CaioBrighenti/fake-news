Just to remind everybody. And how many of you would vote for him again?\"\n\nShe also asked: \"Who here believes that he made the comment about, quote, 's---hole countries?'\"\n\nIt appeared the president was watching Ms Winfrey interviewing his supporters, before tweeting.", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Author%20photos/Con_Coughlin-small.png",
