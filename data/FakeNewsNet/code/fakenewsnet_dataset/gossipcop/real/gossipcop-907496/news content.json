In December, he was sentenced to 60 years in prison on federal child pornography charges, and he pleaded guilty to sexual assault charges.\n\n\u201cYou are so sick,\u201d Raisman said with Nassar sitting in the court. \u201cYou took advantage of our passions and our dreams. I am here to face you, Larry, so you can see I have regained my strength. That I am no longer a victim, I am a survivor.\u201d\n\nRaisman also directed her fury at USA Gymnastics (USGA) and the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC), calling USGA an organization \u201crotting from the inside,\u201d and urging both the USGA and USOC to conduct an independent investigation into \u201chow this happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have represented the USA in two Olympics and have done so successfully,\u201d Raisman said in her statement. \u201cAnd both USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success, but did they reach out when I came forward? No.\u201d\n\nAs of Friday morning, Raisman was one of 70 women to deliver victim impact statements including teammate Jordyn Wieber, CNN reported. In all, up to 120 women are expected to deliver statements.\n\nFour out of the Fierce Five, the team members who won the team gold medal in 2012, have accused Nassar of sexual abuse. McKayla Maroney wrote an impact statement letter, which was read to the court earlier this week, while Gabby Douglas has also spoken out about Nassar.\n\nOf the Final Five, the nickname for the 2016 gymnastics team, Raisman and Simone Biles have come out with allegations against Nassar.\n\nRaisman\u2019s full testimony is below:", "images": ["https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fortune-logo-1600x900-black.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/40566226573_e0c5ababf1_k.jpg?quality=60&resize=60,33", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/40566226573_e0c5ababf1_k.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mpw-revised-logo-2-42.png", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wayfair-walkout-e1562960178767.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/47532413271_be1a461cf8_k.jpg?quality=60&resize=60,33", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gettyimages-1079242950.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gettyimages-1059133394.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/twitter-netflix-sassy-account.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/47532413271_be1a461cf8_k.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wayfair-walkout-e1562960178767.jpg?quality=60&resize=60,60", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gettyimages-1079242950.jpg?quality=60&resize=60,33", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1158668170.jpg?quality=60&resize=60,60", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mpw-revised-logo-2-42.png?quality=60&resize=60,33", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1158668170.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/themes/fortune/client/src/images/subscribe-bg.png", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/fortune-logo-1600x900-black.jpg?quality=60&resize=60,60", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/twitter-netflix-sassy-account.jpg?quality=60&resize=60,33", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/for07.19-cov.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/for0619-fortune-500-2019-domestic-cover.jpg", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-498074902.jpg?resize=1200,600", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gettyimages-1059133394.jpg?quality=60&resize=60,33", "data: image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-498074902.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anne Sraders", "Emma Kinery", "Alan Murray", "Renae Reints"], "canonical_link": "https://fortune.com/2018/01/19/watch-gold-medalist-aly-raismans-powerful-statement-at-larry-nassers-sentencing/", "title": "Watch Gold Medalist Aly Raisman\u2019s Powerful Statement at Larry Nasser\u2019s Sentencing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "JRFNeudqAejM1a-TR7d05Ddr9_M8fHFT3Q4rCYsUkxc", "description": "In her victim impact statement Raisman also addresses USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee.", "keywords": "Larry Nassar, Aly raisman, Simone Biles, McKayla Maroney, Jordyn Wieber, USA Gymnastics, Me Too, Michigan State University", "og": {"url": "https://fortune.com/2018/01/19/watch-gold-medalist-aly-raismans-powerful-statement-at-larry-nassers-sentencing/", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Gold Medalist Aly Raisman's Powerful Statement at Larry Nasser's Sentencing", "description": "She also called out USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee", "site_name": "Fortune", "image": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-498074902.jpg?resize=1200,600", "width": 1024, "height": 682}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Watch Gold Medalist Aly Raisman's Powerful Statement at Larry Nasser's Sentencing", "description": "She also called out USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee", "image": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-498074902.jpg?resize=1200,600", "url": "https://fortune.com/2018/01/19/watch-gold-medalist-aly-raismans-powerful-statement-at-larry-nassers-sentencing/"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeoeECXFksI?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1516338000.0, "source": "http://fortune.com", "summary": ""}
