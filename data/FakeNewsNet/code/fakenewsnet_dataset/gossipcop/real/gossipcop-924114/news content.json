They also attended Maren Morris and Ryan Hurd\u2018s wedding together over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe met a long time ago \u2014 I think it was at a CMA afterparty \u2014 and it was like a hi-bye, never saw him again, never hung out,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd then, gosh I think it was December of last year, we decided to take our dogs to the dog park \u2026 and we hit it off! For now \u2014 I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s still new.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Voice Winner Cassadee Pope Is Dating Nashville\u2018s Sam Palladio\n\nImage zoom Cassadee Pope and Sam Palladio Rick Diamond/Getty\n\nNot only is the couple\u2019s chemistry a match, but so are their dogs. \u201cThey\u2019re the complete opposites, but they love each other,\u201d said Pope, who is the proud pet parent of French bulldog Cuppy, while Palladio owns a Whippet named River.\n\n\u201cI think the original idea [for the date] was his and then I was like, \u2018How about tomorrow?\u2019 \u201d Pope shared, adding that their relationship is \u201csuper easy breezy.\u201d\n\nThis is Pope\u2019s first relationship after ending her engagement to All Time Low drummer Rian Dawson last summer after seven years together. Palladio \u2014 who plays Gunnar Scott on the CMT series \u2014 previously dated Nashville costar Chaley Rose.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

My last relationship started when I was 18 and ended a year ago. And I definitely did the dating thing for a minute and was like, \u2018I need to take time for myself.\u2019 And it was the most monumental time in my life, which was both scary, terrible and amazing,\u201d Pope revealed.\n\n\u201cI did go on an app called Raya; there were some hilarious people on there. It was fun. Honestly, it was just the flirting that was what made me think, \u2018Okay I can do this.\u2019 Because when you get out of that long a relationship, you\u2019re like, \u2018Will I ever find somebody again?'\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cYou think this irrational thought: \u2018I\u2019m never going to find anybody\u2019 and then you feel desired by people and you\u2019re just like, \u2018Oh, okay I can do this. This is going to be fine.\u2019 And that was a really silly, fun time and I never did anything like that. I resisted it. Then I got tired and didn\u2019t want to do this anymore and things fell into place.\u201d\n\nMy new song #TakeYouHome is coming out this Friday! Here\u2019s a little look behind the scenes. Can\u2019t wait for you all to hear it. \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/bPiZYpmpZh \u2014 Cassadee Pope (@CassadeePope) March 28, 2018\n\nHoly. Crap. All the love is making my heart swell. And #TakeYouHome isn\u2019t even out yet! T-Minus 14 hours. Been waiting for this for a long time \ud83c\udf7e \u2014 Cassadee Pope (@CassadeePope) March 29, 2018\n\nThe \u201cThink of You\u201d star will be back to her old stomping grounds shortly as she returns to The Voice \u2014 which she won in 2012 \u2014 as Kelly Clarkson\u2018s adviser. Pope is scheduled to appear April 2, 3 and 9.\n\nPope will release her latest song, \u201cTake You Home,\u201d Friday at midnight. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for you all to hear it,\u201d she captioned a video on Twitter, sharing a behind the scenes clip.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/avril-lavigne.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630",
