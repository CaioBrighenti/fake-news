Rodriguez/Getty\n\nIt\u2019s official.\n\nAlmost two years after announcing their decision to split, Yolanda Hadid and David Foster are divorced. According to legal documents obtained by The Blast, a judgment was entered in court Oct. 16.\n\nAfter four years of marriage and a total of nine years together, the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star and music producer announced their divorce exclusively to PEOPLE on Dec. 1, 2015.\n\n\u201cSadly we have decided to go our separate ways,\u201d they said in a statement at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ve shared nine beautiful and joyous years together. During that time we experienced love, friendship and the inevitable challenges that come with managing a marriage, careers, blended families and health issues.\u201d\n\nHadid, 53, who was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012, has been open about the strain her health struggles put on their marriage as symptoms like joint pain, exhaustion, insomnia, and anxiety plagued her daily, making simple tasks like answering an email extremely difficult.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden all of the things we shared, all of the things we used to love to do together \u2014 go for walks in the morning, having a studio in the house and blasting music all day, having dinner parties \u2014 that all shut down,\u201d she told PEOPLE in August. \u201cI couldn\u2019t participate in that life anymore.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Yolanda Hadid Reveals How Lyme Disease Devastated Her Life & Marriage in Memoir\n\nHadid also opened up about the toll the illness took on her marriage in her September memoir, Believe Me: My Battle With the Invisibility of Lyme Disease.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to feel that David is unhappy with the fact that I can\u2019t be by his side the way that I used to be,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI try to make light of it and joke that he married a lemon. It\u2019s sad but true. I went from being the funny girlfriend who was up for anything and had endless energy to the wife who is too sick to be by his side.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lost his wingman, his partner in crime, and I fell as if he\u2019s starting to get impatient with my recovery,\u201d she continued. \u201cI understand that even brief periods of illness can strain important relationships in your life. A chronic condition like mine, one that has consumed years of our lives, poses enormous challenges.\u201d\n\nDespite her best efforts, she was unable to maintain her former lifestyle. After the couple split, Hadid left Los Angeles, relocating to New York to be closer to her three children: models Gigi, Bella and Anwar.\n\n\u201cI had a great run with him,\u201d she previously told PEOPLE of her ex-husband. \u201cI will always hold that in high regard and have gratitude for that time together.\u201d\n\nFoster, 67, opened up about the divorce at the Grammy Museum\u2019s third annual gala in Los Angeles last month.\n\n\u201cWe just always did our best,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cWe had some other issues as well, but everybody\u2019s in a good place now. The main thing is that she\u2019s healthy and in remission. She worked really hard at it and now she\u2019s reaping the rewards of that.\u201d", "images":
