After the cast\u2019s ultra sexy Entertainment Weekly shoot, Lili Reinhart did a spread with W Magazine. In it, she talks about suddenly being famous, perceiving herself as a disappointment to fans, and what she thought when she first met her Riverdale costars.\n\nAnd yes, that includes her first impression of Cole Sprouse, her maybe boyfriend, but honestly who knows anymore.\n\nWhen asked what her first impressions were of her fellow costars, Reinhart told the magazine, \"I thought KJ [Apa] was so hot, so charming. I had seen Cole [Sprouse] and Camila [Mendes] at the studio test, and thought Cami was so beautiful. It\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t really remember having an opinion on Cole, to be honest. Of course, I had grown up watching [The Suite Life] but I wasn\u2019t really starstruck. He just seemed like this really attractive, normal guy.\u201d\n\nWe definitely didn\u2019t expect her to come right out with \u201cKJ was so hot.\u201d We were also expecting a much bigger reaction to the bb Sprouse, but we\u2019ll take what we can get.\n\nReinhart also explained why she thinks fans might be let down when they meet her.\n\n\"When people come up and ask for pictures, it\u2019s like, of course,\" says Reinhart. \"And sometimes I am in a terrible mood, but I\u2019ll still do it, and then I do feel like, \u2018What if that fan experience was a let down for them and I wasn\u2019t as exciting in person?\u2019 But I am not Betty Cooper. I\u2019m always going to try to be as happy and grateful to fans, but I\u2019m also just trying to live my life. I don\u2019t have an on switch all of the time.\"\n\nGirl, we get it. And as Reinhart says herself in the interview, she\u2019s still getting used to being famous:\n\n\u201cThe show took off in such a way that fame followed very quickly after, and it wasn\u2019t really a smooth transition. It was just kind of like, \u2018Bam.'\u201d\n\nBAM.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/26131622/glow-e1530044218889.jpeg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/03161430/shows.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/28135359/michael-scott-e1530219265245.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/13112629/jimmy-kimmel-e1531506399286.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/10/31073154/Lili-Reinhart2-e1540996361399.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/19085725/lili-reinhart-e1550595452664.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/03113153/UKS_kimmy.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/01193751/of.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/08/06122235/073018-becca-horoscope-lead-e1533584062450.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/26071400/Mindy.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/10/08084159/Bobs-Burgers.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072542/avatar-g-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/25150120/shows3.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/10/02131819/danelle-dwts-e1538511544774.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/06102511/shows.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/06/06141237/carrie-satc.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/20111436/comic-con-e1532110490146.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/09/07111301/reese-witherspoon-e1536344021796.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/27055849/riverdale2-e1506542348766.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/25140721/friends.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/28081104/Luke-Perry-e1551370385989.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/07/12222831/shows1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/27055849/riverdale2-e1506542348766.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Vanderberg"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/lili-reinharts-first-reactions-to-meeting-her-riverdale-co-stars-was-not-what-we-expected/", "title": "Lili Reinhart\u2019s first reaction to meeting her \u201cRiverdale\" costars was not what we expected", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "cole sprouse,interviews,Riverdale", "news_keywords": "cole sprouse,interviews,Riverdale", "description": "Lili Reinhart reveals to \"W Magazine\" what she thought when she first met her \"Riverdale\" co-stars, including Cole Sprouse.", "og": {"title": "Lili Reinhart\u2019s first reaction to meeting her \u201cRiverdale\" costars was not what we expected", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/lili-reinharts-first-reactions-to-meeting-her-riverdale-co-stars-was-not-what-we-expected/", "description": "Spill the tea girl.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/27055849/riverdale2-e1506542348766.jpg", "width": 563, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/lili-reinharts-first-reactions-to-meeting-her-riverdale-co-stars-was-not-what-we-expected/", "description": "Lili Reinhart reveals to \"W Magazine\" what she thought when she first met her \"Riverdale\" co-stars, including Cole Sprouse.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/27055849/riverdale2-e1506542348766.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/lili-reinharts-first-reactions-to-meeting-her-riverdale-co-stars-was-not-what-we-expected/", "title": "Lili Reinhart\u2019s first reaction to meeting her \u201cRiverdale\" costars was not what we expected", "description": "Spill the tea girl.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/27055849/riverdale2-e1506542348766.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
