For Letitia Wright, the breakout star of Black Panther who knows how to drop a beat, Jimmy Fallon brought out the latter.\n\nThe Tonight Show host refereed a freestyle trade-off between Wright and The Roots\u2019 Tariq Trotter (a.k.a. Black Thought). Pressing the random topic generator, the actor\u2019s first challenge was to piece a rap together that mentioned \u201cdisco,\u201d \u201cRed Lobster,\u201d and the \u201cvibranium\u201d metal from Black Panther.\n\nWhat followed were gems like, \u201cYo, yo, let\u2019s grab some food at Red Lobster/ Roots, tell me how I can win an Oscar.\u201d\n\nTariq somehow managed to work in \u201cSnuffleupagus,\u201d and Wright closed out her set with rhymes about \u201chammer,\u201d \u201cburrito,\u201d and \u201cBenedict Cumberbatch.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn and out of portals like Doctor Strange, a.k.a. Benedict Cumberbatch comin\u2019 through the hatch,\u201d she laughed.\n\nWright and her Black Panther costars Danai Gurira and Lupita Nyong\u2019o told EW about their rap battles on the film\u2019s set during the Warrior Falls scenes. \u201cThere were many people on set, huge set, and I was just messing about,\u201d Wright recalled. \u201cI was trying to spit game to even Lupita or Danai because we\u2019re all close together.\u201d\n\nSince then, they reprised their rap battles amid the film\u2019s debut in theaters. \u201cOh boy, I feel some bars coming!\u201d Nyong\u2019o said in a video posted to social media, calling Wright \u201cthe best freestyler in Wakanda.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s get Wright in a Drop the Mic session against James Corden.", "images":
