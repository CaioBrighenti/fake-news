The two also claimed that representatives of Class 5 Films were aware of the fire that broke out on March 22 but did not let residents of the building know.\n\n\u201cWhen representatives of Class 5, Inc. became aware of the fire, they did not warn the tenants in the building\u2026 in fact, they misled the tenants into believing there had been a fire that had been extinguished,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nSollazzo-Lampkin\u2019s attorney, Geovanny Fernandez, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Cruzes\u2019 apartment building was completely destroyed, causing them to be displaced and lose multiple personal items such as clothes, important documents and the loss of their rent-controlled apartment, their lawsuit says.\n\nThe fire allegedly exacerbated Erica\u2019s asthma and caused her severe emotional distress as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and nightmares.\n\nThe Cruzes also claim the fire was caused by \u201creckless, careless and negligent\u201d maintenance of the building such as failing to have fire extinguishers or working smoke detectors.\n\nIn a statement provided to PEOPLE at the time, the film\u2019s producers offered \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the family of Michael R. Davidson, who lost his life.\n\n\u201cOur production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us,\u201d read the statement. \u201cAs soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

We watched firsthand with astonishment as they charged into the smoke to make sure all were safely out and then fought to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading, putting their lives on the line as they do every day. The FDNY are real-life super-heroes and have our boundless admiration and gratitude.\u201d\n\nNew York City firefighters responded to the scene of the massive 5-alarm fire and Michael R. Davidson was killed as he helped to put out the fire.\n\nThe 37-year-old father of four was critically injured on the scene and \u201ctransported to Harlem Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,\u201d FDNY officials wrote on Facebook early Friday morning.\n\nImage zoom The site where the fire broke out in Harlem, New York City PacificCoastNews\n\n\u201cIt is with deep regret that FDNY announces the death of Firefighter Michael R. Davidson,\u201d they added on Twitter \u2014 both social media posts coming with a photo of the late firefighter, who they say was \u201ccited for bravery on four separate occasions.\u201d\n\nDavidson has \u201cbravely served the Department for 15 years\u201d and is \u201cthe 1,150th member to make the Supreme Sacrifice while serving our city,\u201d the FDNY wrote.\n\nImage zoom Michael R. Davidson was a firefighter who died after sustaining critical injuries in the fire FDNY/Twitter\n\nHe is survived by his wife Eileen and their four children \u2014 who, per a tweet from NYC Councilmember Mark D. Levine, are ages 7, 6, 3, and 1. Davidson\u2019s father and brother are also firefighters.\n\nNorton was filming earlier in the building for the 1950s-set drama, based on a book of the same name by Jonathan Lethem. The area in which the film was shooting was unoccupied.\n\nThe movie \u2014 which Norton also stars in alongside Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin, Bobby Cannavale, Leslie Mann and Willem Dafoe \u2014 tells the story of a private detective with Tourette\u2019s Syndrome who seeks to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend.", "images":
