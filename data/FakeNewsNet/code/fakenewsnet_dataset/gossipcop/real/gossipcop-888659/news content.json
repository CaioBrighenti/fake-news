She just starred in a short film directed by her now-fiance called \"Ingenue-ish.\"\n\nThe duo are certainly into theme parks, as McHugh has posted some nice photos of the two at Disney before.\n\n\"I\u2019ll always be the #Mickey to his.....whatever he feels like wearing,\" she wrote earlier this month.\n\nAnd there's this photo taken on Splash Mountain.\n\n\"There is no better way to celebrate both #Disneyland and #SplashMountain's birthdays than by riding Splash Mountain with the man who came up with the idea for the ride, the Legend #TonyBaxter !! I swear that's him behind the really enthusiastic man,\" she said of Stamos screaming during the ride.\n\nThere is no better way to celebrate both #Disneyland and #SplashMountain 's birthdays than by riding Splash Mountain with the man who came up with the idea for the ride, the Legend #TonyBaxter !!
