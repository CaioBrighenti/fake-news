During the show, Rivera was not asked about Salling\u2019s death or their previous relationship.\n\nSalling was found dead on Tuesday in an apparent suicide just a month before he was to be sentenced to prison for possession of child pornography.\n\nRivera and Salling starred on Glee together from 2009 to 2015 during which she portrayed cheerleader Santana while he played jock Puck. During the early seasons of the Fox series, their characters had a brief romance.\n\nRELATED GALLERY: From Tragedy and Suicide to Continued Success, Where the Stars of Glee Are Now\n\nImage zoom Naya Rivera on Jan. 31 Derek Storm / Splash\n\nRELATED: Glee Fans React to Mark Salling\u2019s Death by Apparent Suicide: \u2018First Cory Monteith, Now This\u2019\n\nOff-camera, Rivera and Salling dated as they filmed together. But in her 2016 memoir, Sorry Not Sorry, she wrote that he dumped her at the request of his publicist, who said she wasn\u2019t good for his image.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Glee\u2019s Mark Salling Dead in Apparent Suicide a Month Before His Sentencing in Child Porn Case\n\nSalling was charged with possession of child pornography in 2016, and pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor back in October 2017, agreeing to a plea deal in December that involved serving four to seven years in prison with a supervised release for 20 years.\n\n\u201cWhen Mark dumped me, I thought it was the worst thing ever, but can you imagine if that didn\u2019t happen? And I was laying there in bed when the battering ram came through the door?\u201d Rivera wrote after hearing about Salling\u2019s charges.\n\n\u201cI think everyone should have that one relationship where you look back and ask yourself, \u2018What the hell was I thinking?\u2019 You\u2019ll learn something and you won\u2019t regret it,\u201d she continued. \u201cUnless, of course, that relationship was with someone who had a sizable stash of child porn on his computer. Then, by all means, regret everything.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Mark Salling and Naya Rivera in 2010\n\nWhile Glee cast members Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch shared their reactions to Salling\u2019s death. Rivera has yet to comment.\n\nIf you or someone you know is showing warning signs of suicide or considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255), texting
