Among her other stumbles? Call Me By Your Name\u2018s screenwriter James Ivory and producers Luca Guadagnino, Emilie Georges and Marco Morabito; The Post\u2018s producer Kristie Macosko Krieger, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u2018s producers Graham Broadbent and Pete Czernin.\n\n\u201cMissouri\u201d proved to be a recurring problem as well, Haddish wavering between pronouncing the state \u201cMissour-ie\u201d and \u201cMissour-a\u201d while reading the film\u2019s 7 nominations.\n\nThe actress later took to Twitter and said that she felt like she \u201cwas a substitute teacher in a Key & Peel skit\u201d in a reply to The Disaster Artist writer Michael H.

He famously hosted the ceremony last year, when the wrong film was announced as the Best Picture winner.\n\nDespite the snafu, Kimmel received rave reviews for his performance as host. He held nothing back while making a few jabs at Mel Gibson, Justin Timberlake and Manchester by the Sea. And of course, he brought his ongoing feud with Matt Damon to the show.\n\nThe 2018 Oscars ceremony will be held at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center on March 4 and will be televised live on ABC at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/academy.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630",
