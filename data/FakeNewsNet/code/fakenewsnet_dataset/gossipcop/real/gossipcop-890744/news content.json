Trump is the eldest child of Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump.\n\n\"Taking it to the next level #merica #maga #halloween #costume #nyc #kids #trump,\" he captioned a slideshow of photos with his kids on Instagram.\n\nTrump, who shares 10-year-old Kai, 8-year-old Donald, 6-year-old Tristan, 5-year-old Spencer and 3-year-old Chloe with wife Vanessa Trump, visited a haunted house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with his children.\n\n\"Literally a full interactive maze. They go all out and it's amazing,\" he said of the neighborhood attraction, which was located in someone's home. \"They also let anyone in to see it.\"\n\nTaking it to the next level #merica #maga #halloween #costume #nyc #kids #trump A post shared by Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) on Oct 31, 2017 at 2:21pm PDT\n\nTrump followed up by sharing a photo of daughter Chloe before putting his kids to bed.
