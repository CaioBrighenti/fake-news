Photo credit: Jerry Metellus\n\nChanning Tatum is bringing a live show based on the film Magic Mike to London\u2019s Hippodrome Casino.\n\nMagic Mike Live begins previews on November 10 and opens on November 28. It is currently booking until April 28, 2019.\n\nConceived and co-directed by Tatum, Magic Mike Live is a large-scale live strip show based on the Magic Mike films, which tell the story of a 19-year-old entering the world of male stripping.

Guests must be at least 18 years old to attend.\n\nChief executive of the Hippodrome Casino, Simon Thomas, said: \u201cIn so many ways Magic Mike Live is a perfect fit for us.\n\n\u201cSince 1900, the venue has been delighting, shocking and reinventing the way London and its visitors are entertained. This is yet another example of how the Hippodrome resolutely refuses to stand still.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we prepare to close our theatre for a three-month, multi-million pound refurbishment, my senior management and our 730 employees look forward to joining all of London in giving Channing Tatum, the incredibly talented performers and his world-class production team, the warmest welcome the capital can muster.\u201d\n\nMagic Mike Live in London is co-directed by Tatum and Alison Faulk, with Teresa Espinosa as associate director, and choreographed by Faulk, Espinosa and Luke Broadlick.\n\nThe show has production design by Rachel O\u2019Toole, set design by Rob Bissinger and Anita LaScala, costumes by Marina Toybina, lighting by Philip Gladwell and video by Luke Halls.\n\nMusical supervision is by Jack Rayner, with sound by Nick Kourtides.\n\nMagic Mike Live is produced in London by Tatum, Reid Carolin, Greg Jacobs, Peter Kiernan, Steven Soderbergh, Nick Wechsler and United Talent Agency in association with Warner Bros., Vincent Marini, the Hippodrome Casino, Bruce Robert Harris and Jack W. Batman, TSG Entertainment and Ashley DeSimone, Richard Winkler, and the Creative House.\n\nIf you are interested in working on Magic Mike Live, click here to apply for backstage opportunities.",
