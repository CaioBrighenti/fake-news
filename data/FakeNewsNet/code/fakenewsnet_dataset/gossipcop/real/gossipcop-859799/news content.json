Since, she's gone on to lead her own Disney Channel series, forage a successful singing career, and, oh yeah, become the most followed person on Instagram. Over the years, her style has evolved just as much as her career. In those early, teen queen days, Gomez favored girly frocks in vibrant, bold colors, often paired with a pair of statement heels. Today, thanks to a partnership with stylist Kate Young, Gomez frequently steps out in edgy, fashion forward designs that are equal parts modern and feminine. As a muse for Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquiere, and with a new Coach collaboration due out this Fall, don't expect the superstar's red carpet moments to come to a halt anytime soon. Here, in honor of her birthday, a look at Gomez's best red carpet moments.", "keywords": "celebrity style,red carpet,Selena Gomez,Style Evolution", "fb": {"app_id": 230068530489385, "admins": 108943, "pages": 40621875003}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "title": "Selena Gomez: From Disney Days to Leather Louis Vuitton", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/gallery/selena-gomez-best-red-carpet-moments/all", "description": "Selena Gomez has come a long way since appearing as a young kid on Barney & Friends.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597356b04b5fd97d69f45b6b/2:1/w_790,c_limit/GettyImages-661157906_master.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "wmag", "title": "Selena Gomez: From Disney Days to Leather Louis Vuitton", "description": "Selena Gomez has come a long way since appearing as a young kid on Barney & Friends.", "image": "https://media.wmagazine.com/photos/597356b04b5fd97d69f45b6b/2:1/w_790,c_limit/GettyImages-661157906_master.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "domain": "wmagazine.com"}, "version": "2.0.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
