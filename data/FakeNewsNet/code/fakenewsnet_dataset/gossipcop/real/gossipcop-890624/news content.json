One staple that is back in the spotlight however is the beloved, super powered serum.\n\nNestling in-between your cleanser and moisturiser, this step is the head honcho of the trio. Reason being, a serum can, and should, have the most concentrated of ingredients to target your specific concerns. Meaning not only does a little go a long way, but you can expect results sooner rather than later.\n\nSold? Of course you are. However, the breadth of what\u2019s on offer is a total minefield. Equally it\u2019s not a one size fits all.\n\n\n\nFor instance if you\u2019re after a moisture boost, vitamin A is a big fat no \u2013 as it is technically retinol, so can dry out your skin \u2013 but we know the feeling of getting giddy in the skincare aisles all too well and ending up with a shelfie stocked like it\u2019s the end of the world.\n\nSo with that in mind, here\u2019s a toast to some classics and new kids on the block living up to their wrinkle busting and plumping promises so you can choose wisely.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps us to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nFor first timer's: Estee Lauder advanced night repair: From \u00a353, Look Fantastic\n\nA well done classic never goes out of style. Back in 1982, night repair changed the skincare game with the brown bottle many of us have come to know and love. The formula is also patented until 2033 so we won\u2019t be finding anything similar anytime soon.\n\nThe peachy, comforting serum is an oil-free, moisture magnet hero. Suggested use is a few drops but we\u2019ve been whacking plenty on at present while fighting against recent gale force winds. It celebrates itself as a fighter against free radicals, preventing future damage and repairing previous mishaps.\n\nIt\u2019s a great accompaniment to a nighttime routine whatever your skin type. A worthy all rounder and effective on mature skin types in particular. This would be a great starting point for anyone wanting to dip their toe into an effective serum that does a bit of everything.\n\nBuy now\n\nFor anti-pollution: Drunk Elephant C-Firma day serum: \u00a367, Space NK\n\nDrunk Elephant has been stocked consistently on our shelves since the launch in October, so we\u2019ve had ample time to get to grips with this perky powerhouse.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the multitasker so let\u2019s break it down. The 15 per cent L-ascorbic acid is the frontrunner, which ironically has nothing to do with acid, it\u2019s actually the gold standard of vitamin C. When used in skincare, this notoriously aids against environmental stressors. Supporting fruit enzymes help dissolve surface skin cells to give you a brighter complexion.\n\nThis works best as fresh as possible, so a big tip is to keep this in the fridge. It will change colour (darker and more orange) over time which is a signifier that its potency is dwindling. We saw that housing it next to the yoghurts subsequently gave it some further airtime. It\u2019s also quite tacky to apply so you\u2019ve got to slap it on quick. Or if you\u2019re feeling particularly fancy, mix it with an extra hydrating serum. Drunk Elephant\u2019s B-Hydra is C-Firma\u2019s partner in crime for the perfect, trademark \"skin smoothie\".\n\nResults are evened out, plumped up skin ready to take on the city. So even if the Tube feels like you\u2019re riding in a big bin, having this in your arsenal will help ensure the rubbish doesn\u2019t leave the carriage. Interestingly, C-Firma has something called a reservoir effect, meaning it stays active on the skin for up to 72 hours after it is absorbed. Excuse us, while we go and take a dip.\n\nBuy now\n\nFor dewy skin: Hourglass No. 28 serum: From \u00a320, Cult Beauty\n\nHave you ever wondered how when models jump out of swimming pools on adverts, with a full face on, they don\u2019t look like a racoon like us mere mortals would? We think we have uncovered the secret.\n\nWhile this does market itself as a primer, it has a cocktail of 28 rather nice ingredients from lavender to hazelnut oil and a sprinkling of vitamins to help soften out fine lines and give you smoother looking skin. It\u2019s a super luxe, pink, rich formula that feels like you\u2019ve recreated the infamous Flashdance scene at your dresser. Like you\u2019ve just done a workout, not sweaty but perfectly perspired.\n\nIndeed it does help makeup sit very nicely, however wearing it on its own as a nighttime treatment, or even on the ends of your hair if they\u2019re looking particularly knackered are also good tips. Admittedly it might not be for you if you\u2019re prone to excess oil, but this is the ideal quick fix for a bougiee boost.\n\nBuy now\n\nFor advanced anti-ageing: Sunday Riley A+ high dose retinoid serum: \u00a370, Cult Beauty\n\nRetinol has always been a contentious subject. Many stating you can use it only under certain circumstances (No AHAs) while others decline entirely from the off. However, it\u2019s one of the very few ingredients actually proven to fight ageing, targeting fine lines specifically and increasing cell turnover.\n\nWhile Sunday Riley\u2019s new attempt does have a whopping 6.5 per cent retinoid complex, it\u2019s balanced out with Hawaiian white honey and cactus extract to help you adjust during your first few weeks. It\u2019s a more creamy, emollient retinol product than we\u2019ve come to expect, making it smooth and easy to apply. There\u2019s also CoQ10 in here to soothe and support \u2013 preventing the dreaded peeling!\n\nOverall this is a terrific over the counter retinol product, good for sensitive and acne prone skin especially. If you\u2019re after something that gives you the anti-ageing benefits of a traditional retinol, without going through the Freddy Kruger, flaking redness phase, definitely pick this one up. Do proceed with caution however as the formula is strong and you must always wear SPF. Start slowly and get a feel for it; listen to your skin. Slow and steady wins the race.\n\nBuy now\n\nFor the peepers: Dennis Gross rerulic + retinol triple correction eye serum: \u00a365, Space NK\n\nAs we all know, the eye area is the first to take a beating. This is not an eye cream, let\u2019s get that out of the way. While this does need to be followed up with a more moisturising product, if you are particularly dry, the results speak for themselves.\n\nThis is definitely for you if you\u2019re wanting to target any lines or crepiness in particular. What\u2019s even more wonderful is that this can be used on the lids to really brighten the entire area. Liquorice root extract not only helps brighten but also has anti-inflammatory properties to help soothe the effects of the retinol.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks we saw a genuine improvement. Lines were less deep and skin around the eyes definitely perked up. A wake up call we\u2019re happy to receive.\n\nBuy now\n\nFor hydration: Dr. Barbara Sturm hyaluronic serum: \u00a3230, Cult Beauty\n\nDr. Sturm not only had a hand in pioneering the famous vampire facial, she\u2019s also a big believer in no nonsense highly effective skincare. Our favourite being hyaluronic acid.\n\nNow, we know that hyaluronic acid is plastered all over every product these days, but the quality and how it\u2019s blended into the ingredients can have an impact on is efficacy.\n\nWhat makes this one particularly good is that it has long and short chain molecules. The former providing instant hydration with immediate effects while the latter penetrates deeper into the skin. Equally, purslane is Sturm\u2019s key selling point; an ancient herb that appears in no other skincare line which in recent studies has shown to up-regulate youth enzymes to keep cells alive longer. Ironic it\u2019s been knocking around for hundreds of years.\n\nUltimately, all that aside, it\u2019s the best hyaluronic on the market for a moisture surge. It\u2019s a pricey prescription but medicine is never fun is it?\n\nBuy now\n\nFor minimising pores: Paula\u2019s Choice 10% niacinamide booster: \u00a340, Paula\u2019s Choice\n\nWhat we love about Paula Begoun is the fact that her website isn\u2019t just a shop, it\u2019s a library of studies, information and overall help. You get the impression she really does want the best for everyone\u2019s face which is a rarity of transparency. Not only does she talk the talk, she walks the walk.\n\nOne of the goodies in her serums cabinet is the niacinamide booster. Again, this ingredient is everywhere but this booster is like a super shot of the wonder ingredient.\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely light, watery texture which you can apply directly to specific areas or add to your moisturiser for an all over application. The major selling point of niacinamide is its ability to reduce the look of enlarged pores, but we found it\u2019s also helpful for blemish marks and has no nasties to boot. What\u2019s not to love?\n\nBuy now\n\nFor dry skin: Kat Burki rosehip revitalising serum: \u00a3150, Space NK\n\nWe\u2019re all too familiar with Kat on our shelves but she never seems to disappoint, so we welcomed this serum with open arms.\n\nThe main active sell in this is the rose hip seed oil which has been around for yonks; notorious for its hydrating properties. Furthermore in this nifty product is the KB5 complex which is a mix of arnica, gotu kola, lavender, calendula and chamomile to work in synergy together to increase the potency of the formula.\n\nIt\u2019s a white, non-sticky gel/cream hybrid which sinks into skin easily. Results are super soft, revitalised skin. Particularly good if you\u2019re prone to feeling a bit weather-beaten as it steers towards the drier skin type.\n\nAgain with all Burki\u2019s products, there are no fillers so you get what you pay for; meaning it\u2019s jam packed with nutrient goodness.\n\nBuy now\n\nFor all round care: W=hb2 power duo face serum: \u00a3110, Feel Good Matters\n\nFrom the brain of Yilin Wang, comes a rather interesting take on the perception of skincare. Wang is a big believer that the eco-system of one\u2019s life, mind, body and energy around us, need to be balanced in order for any to operate well. The brand name stands for Well = Health and Beauty Squared.\n\nWhether that gets you excited or not, the results and ingredients on offer here will intrigue you regardless. Housed in a rose gold topped, plastic bottle \u2013 inside are two 15ml tubes \u2013 one named Phase 1 Beauty (yes please) and Phase 2 Health (yes please x 2). The first is an almost clear gel serum with probiotics and rose stem cell technology which is all about strengthening and repairing up the skin. Phase 2 is a moringa, raspberry stem cell and niacinamide mix focusing on protecting and hydration.\n\nNot only is this very satisfying to use and looks rather snazzy, it gives a supple and plumped feel to the skin. It feels suitably protected and nourished.\n\nSo if you\u2019re someone who has no time to take a deep breath, at least you know this serum is meditating on your behalf.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Anti-ageing serums\n\nWe had to give advanced night repair the top spot. It\u2019s stood the test of time and still remains effective. The Hourglass serum is just too good to pass up. Even the travel size will last you a while. Dennis Gross has the best anti-ageing products for your eyes on the market in our opinion.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
