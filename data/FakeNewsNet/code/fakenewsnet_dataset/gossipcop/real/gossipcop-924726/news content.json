I\u2019m 46 years old and I don\u2019t mind looking 46 years old.\u201d\n\nAdding, \u201cI was always surprised that people were surprised that I would post a picture without any makeup on.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Oops!

I do have some wrinkles. I call them smile lines. They\u2019re from smiles and laughing, and those are the best kind of wrinkles,\u201d she shared. \u201cWe did a segment on the show where I got a little Botox. I\u2019m definitely not above it. Whatever it takes to make you feel your best.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Savannah Guthrie Apologizes for Cursing on \u2018Today\u2019 Show\n\nBack in August 2015, Guthrie and co-host Carson Daly got the cosmetic procedure done on live TV.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Like most women, I find it pretty easy to make a remark that\u2019s critical of myself. I sometimes have to catch myself. I don\u2019t want her to mimic it or question herself or her own looks.\u201d\n\nOne way Guthrie teaches Vale about a positive perspective on life is through fitness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to play tennis more and go exercise. She sees me in my sneakers, and says, \u2018Mommy, why do you exercise?\u2019 And of course, I could say, \u2018Oh, I have to lose 10 pounds.; But I say, \u2018Because I want to be healthy and strong.\u2019 And now she says it back to me. She says, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re exercising so you can be healthy and strong,\u2019 \u201d she said in the Today.com post.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/poppy-montgomery.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/awkwafina1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1897px%2C995.925px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/leighton-meester-1-2000.jpg?crop=2px%2C568px%2C1082px%2C569px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-simpson-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C126px%2C1500px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/elm080119wlmiley0004.jpg?crop=2px%2C180px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/savannah-guthrie-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/kayle-lochte.jpg?crop=4px%2C141px%2C1306px%2C685px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/kim.jpg?crop=0px%2C50px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jessica-mcdonald-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/us-open-celebs-day-7-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/mariah-carey.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1211px%2C635.775px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jlo-c-1.jpg?crop=20px%2C333px%2C624px%2C327px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/willie-nelson-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/savannah-guthrie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1590px%2C834.75px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/look-whos-talking.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/brody-jenner-spencer-pratt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tamron-hall.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/khloe-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/savannah-guthrie1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/michelle-williams-2-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C214px%2C1862px%2C978px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/tina-turner-craig.jpg?crop=0px%2C261px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/julio-iglesias-3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/savannah-guthrie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1590px%2C834.75px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/savannah-guthrie-talks-wrinkles-embracing-her-age/", "title": "Savannah Guthrie Talks Wrinkles & Embracing Her Age: 'I Don't Mind Looking 46 Years Old'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Health,Health News,News,Savannah Guthrie,Style,Today,TV", "news_keywords": "Health,Health News,News,Savannah Guthrie,Style,Today,TV", "description": "\"I do have some wrinkles.
