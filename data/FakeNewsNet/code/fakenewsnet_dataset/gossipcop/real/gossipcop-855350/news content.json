(Tomorrow is their first anniversary!)\n\nPippa was glowing in a mint green and pink floral \u201cHepburn\u201d silk dress by The Fold as she held her husband\u2019s hand while walking into the service with mom, Carole Middleton, dad, Michael Middleton and brother, James Middleton.\n\nNews of Pippa\u2019s (now officially Pippa Matthews) pregnancy broke just days before big sister Kate was admitted to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London last month, where she gave birth to Prince Louis on April 23. Pippa and James are expecting their first child together in the fall.\n\nImage zoom James Gourley/Shutterstock\n\nPippa made headlines for the dress she wore to Kate\u2019s royal wedding in 2011. For today\u2019s wedding, the mom-to-be arrived with a barely-there baby bump in a long sleeve mint dress with a drop waist, pleated blush skirt and floral designs. The dress was not a maternity dress, and Charlotte Sutcliffe-Smith, PR for The Fold told PEOPLE, \u201cWe are absolutely delighted she has worn it.\u201d\n\nShe wore her hair in a low bun with a small side braid tucked into it and her makeup natural, as she typically does.\n\nImage zoom Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s the event of the year!

Matthews looked dapper in the same pale blue suit that he wore to his wedding as he walked beside his radiant wife.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Pippa Middleton Is Reportedly Pregnant with Her First Child \u2014 at the Same Time as Sister Kate!\n\nHarry and Meghan were present at Pippa and James\u2019 wedding this time last year.
