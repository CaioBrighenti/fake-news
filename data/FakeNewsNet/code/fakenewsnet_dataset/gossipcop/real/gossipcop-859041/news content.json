In an interview with Nicole Ryan on The Morning Mash Up Monday, the host asked her about The Weeknd and mentioned Joe in the process.\n\n\u2018Both of you have some new things going on in your lives. You have some new people in your lives. Have you gotten a chance to hang together with your new people?\u2019\n\nGomez, who recently split with Bieber and is now seeing the Toronto native, said, \u2018I spend time with my new person a lot. Honestly, If my friends are happy, that makes me happy. That is all I care about.\u2019\n\nSelena went on to say she was \u2018super stoked,\u2019 and that so far, it\u2019s been a magnificent time for the both of them.\n\nUnfortunately, Gomez didn\u2019t reveal too much about Taylor\u2019s new flame, but if the country star is happy, then Joe must have gotten the seal of approval!\n\nAnd how is her romance doing?\n\nAs CI readers know, Gomez has spent the last few months as The Weeknd\u2019s favorite girl, and according to the songstress, she \u2018loves being supportive\u2019 of him.\n\nSelena said her favorite part is when she gets to go to his concert with her hair done up in a bun and \u2018dance all night,\u2019 without worrying about the pressures that come with her performances.\n\nAnd speaking of grand performances, the One Love Manchester concert ended last night with a stadium packed with 60,000 people and the 13 Reasons Why star couldn\u2019t have been more impressed with the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the host and the singer were discussing the One Love concert in the United Kingdom, Selena showed a lot of maturity when she refused to talk down to her ex-boyfriend. The 24-year-old said she thought \u2018Justin did great,\u2019 and the event was fantastic; everyone involved did such a great job.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ariana-grande-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Taylor-Swift-Grammy.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pauley-Perrette-Mark-Harmon-NCIS-300x195.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Selena-Gomez-and-Taylor-Swift-e1496688233864.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/maxresdefault-3-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kylie-jenner-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/anna-collins-instagram-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NeNe-Leakes-Cancer-Stricken-Husband-Gregg-Completes-6-Months-of-Chemotherapy-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-Donald-Trump-Nancy-Pelosi-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/miranda-cosgrove-300x203.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Selena-Gomez-and-Taylor-Swift-e1496688233864.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "Charisse Van Horn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/selena-gomez-likes-taylor-swifts-boyfriend-joe-alwyn-and-heres-why-42531/", "title": "Selena Gomez Likes Taylor Swift\u2019s Boyfriend Joe Alwyn And Here\u2019s Why", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "joe alwyn, one love manchester, selena gomez, taylor swift,", "keywords": "celebrity news, joe alwyn, one love manchester, selena gomez, taylor swift,", "description": "Selena Gomez doesn't have a single negative thing to say about Taylor's new boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.
