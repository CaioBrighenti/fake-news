It's the first pilot that I've tested my way onto, amazingly. The feeling with this was it was something special, absolutely, we thought this was very different and refreshing. But we shot the whole season before a single episode aired, so we didn't know. We shot the whole thing, and after we wrapped, we were a month away from the pilot airing. We heard great things from down here in L.A., from the studio from Warner Bros. and from CW that they love it, they love all the dailies, they love all the cuts. And we believed them and just had to keep our heads down and keep doing what we were doing. Luckily, to this point, it's turned out well. I think that people are liking it, and hopefully we can build that audience and keep on going for 22 seasons.", "images": ["https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/lat_icons/app-bar-logo.svg?v=36", "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/Ma7PtWOPKx2cPC2jHYv_r1PYCOI=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7OCOPNGLRCDTH6UMDBJ5WPLYM.jpg", "https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/tinygif.gif", "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/O3YFT-tZgeLHpPC7jyxZdUCjBE4=/415x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7OCOPNGLRCDTH6UMDBJ5WPLYM.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/Ma7PtWOPKx2cPC2jHYv_r1PYCOI=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7OCOPNGLRCDTH6UMDBJ5WPLYM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Noelene Clark"], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-izombie-finale-david-anders-20150604-story.html", "title": "'iZombie': David Anders says villain Blaine is part-Spike, part-James Spader", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "language": "English (United States), en-US", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2018 Los Angeles Times", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "date": "2015-06-09T14:00:00Z", "googlebot-news": "index", "twitter": {"title": "'iZombie': David Anders says villain Blaine is part-Spike, part-James Spader", "image": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/Ma7PtWOPKx2cPC2jHYv_r1PYCOI=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7OCOPNGLRCDTH6UMDBJ5WPLYM.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@latimes", "creator": "@latimes"}, "fb_title": "'iZombie': David Anders says villain Blaine is part-Spike, part-James Spader", "og": {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-izombie-finale-david-anders-20150604-story.html", "title": "'iZombie': David Anders says villain Blaine is part-Spike, part-James Spader", "image": "https://www.latimes.com/resizer/Ma7PtWOPKx2cPC2jHYv_r1PYCOI=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E7OCOPNGLRCDTH6UMDBJ5WPLYM.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "latimes.com", "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "tag": "Alias (tv program), James Spader, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (tv program), The CW (tv network), Rob Thomas, J.J.
