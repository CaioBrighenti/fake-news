But what happens when a network\u2019s biggest star is also its most controversial?]\n\nShe added that Fox considered picking up the comedy when ABC canceled it last year but couldn\u2019t find the right place on its schedule. Plus, she said, \u201cABC didn\u2019t really prioritize\u201d the series, and it still earned about 8 million viewers every week, so Fox execs are curious to see what happens when they put marketing muscle behind it.\n\nThere was an outcry from fans after \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d was canceled in 2017, and many blamed the fact that Allen is a conservative-leaning actor who attended President Trump\u2019s inauguration. Allen, who compared being a non-liberal in Hollywood these days to \u201c1930s Germany,\u201d also hinted that his character\u2019s beliefs (Allen plays Mike Baxter, who hates Obama and political correctness) caused ABC to ax the show.\n\n[Tim Allen thinks conservative politics might be why \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 got canceled]\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that I think that the cancellation had anything to do with politics,\u201d said Gary Newman, chairman and chief executive officer for Fox Television Group; he theorized that ABC was more interested in shows produced by its own studio. \u201cTim\u2019s personal politics aren\u2019t a big feature on the show. I think if you were to talk to Tim and our showrunners, they would say Mike Baxter is a centrist. \u2026 He doesn\u2019t have extreme views, and the show never delved deeply into political views.\u201d\n\nAnother topic on the call: The cancellation of \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\u201d which sparked intense reaction from fans on social media. (NBC picked up the show about 24 hours after Fox canceled it.)\n\nWalden said they loved the series and cast, yet \u201cultimately, we felt like we didn\u2019t have the exact right place to schedule it this year.\u201d (Fox\u2019s schedule has shifted this fall with the addition of Thursday Night Football.) Walden said \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d performed best on Sunday nights after \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d but the network planned to hand that slot to the popular cartoon \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give \u2018Bob\u2019s Burgers,\u2019 the Emmy-winning huge performer for us, the opportunity to have a plum time period,\u201d she said. \u201cSo once we made that decision, it just really limited the opportunities to schedule \u2018Brooklyn.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFox\u2019s new fall series are \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d a retirement community sitcom executive produced by \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d star Charlie Day, and \u201cRel,\u201d based on the life of Lil Rel Howery, who starred in \u201cGet Out\u201d and \u201cThe Carmichael Show.\u201d\n\nFALL 2018 PRIME-TIME LINEUP ON FOX\n\nNew shows are in bold.\n\nMONDAY\n\n8 p.m. \u201cThe Resident\u201d *\n\n9 p.m. \u201c9-1-1\u201d *\n\nTUESDAY\n\n8 p.m. \u201cThe Gifted\u201d *\n\n9 p.m. \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d *\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n8 p.m. \u201cEmpire\u201d\n\n9 p.m. \u201cStar\u201d\n\nTHURSDAY\n\n8 p.m. NFL Football\n\nFRIDAY\n\n8 p.m. \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d\n\n8:30 p.m. \u201cThe Cool Kids\u201d\n\n9 p.m. \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d *\n\nSUNDAY\n\n7 p.m. \u201cNFL on Fox\u201d\n\n7:30 p.m. \u201cThe OT\u201d\n\n8 p.m. \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d\n\n8:30 p.m. \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d *\n\n9 p.m. \u201cFamily Guy\u201d\n\n9:30 p.m. \u201cRel\u201d\n\n* Moved to a new time slot\n\nRead more:\n\nNBC\u2019s fall schedule: All \u2018Chicago\u2019 on Wednesdays and a 2-hour comedy block on Thursdays\n\nIs your favorite TV show canceled?
