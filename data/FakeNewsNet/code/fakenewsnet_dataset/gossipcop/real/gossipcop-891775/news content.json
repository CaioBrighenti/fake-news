He didn\u2019t actually say anything bad about her, but called out the producers for bringing her on BIP for drama/entertainment when she had a boyfriend. I tweeted him \u201cdidn\u2019t Alexis have a boyfriend too? Wasn\u2019t she brought on for the same reason? Or is that cool because she\u2019s your BFF?\u201d I just side eyed that whole thing.
