Daniel is finding it difficult to maintain balance in his life without Mr. Miyagi guiding him through. The show deals with how the two old rivals cope with the struggles they each face.\n\nJohnny opens a new Cobra Kai dojo that attracts a group of bullied nerds and social outcasts who find a camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, but who take his aggressive philosophy too far, in particular his star pupil, Miguel Diaz. In contrast, Johnny's estranged son, Robby Keene, is also taken in by Daniel, who hires him at his car dealership, without any knowledge that Johnny is his father. Daniel eventually proves a positive influence to the boy, teaching him Mr. Miyagi's philosophy of balance. Meanwhile, Daniel's daughter, Samantha, is caught in the middle of these conflicts as she learns who her true friends are and a better path to follow.\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nJoe Seo as Kyler (season 1)\n\nAnnalisa Cochrane as Yasmine (season 1)\n\nBo Mitchell as Brucks (season 1)\n\nBret Ernst as Louie LaRusso Jr. (season 1)\n\nEd Asner as Sid Weinberg (season 1)\n\nHannah Kepple as Moon\n\nDan Ahdoot as Anoush Norouzi\n\nJonathan Mercedes as A.
