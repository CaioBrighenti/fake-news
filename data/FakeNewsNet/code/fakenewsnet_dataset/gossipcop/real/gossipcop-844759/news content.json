A suggestive new set of photos of Queen Dion in Paris arm-in-arm with her Spanish backup dancer Pepe Mu\u00f1oz has French tabloids declaring him her new \u201cchouchou\u201d (rough translation: sweet piece of hamhock). The shots show Dion, 49, with her hand around Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s arm outside the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she has been spending her summer as she plays a handful of European shows. Mu\u00f1oz, 32, was brought in as recently as last month to dance with Dion on the European tour after he was recommended by the wife of her butler (!), a dancer in Vegas who knew Mu\u00f1oz from his role in Zumanity, the most sexually charged show in the Cirque du Soleil portfolio.\n\nIn a recent profile for Vogue.com on his popular side-hustle as an Instagram fashion illustrator (@pepemunozillustrations has 56,400 followers), Mu\u00f1oz said he received a call from Dion\u2019s personal assistant. By July 3, he was accompanying her to such swish events as the Giambattista Valli Couture show in Paris, where both were reportedly \u201cvoguing\u201d through the show. Does this mean that Dion is going the way of such diva contemporaries as Madonna, Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey, and letting her dance troupe double as her own personal harem? Let us consider the (admittedly scant) evidence: 1. They admire each other\u2019s work\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMu\u00f1oz told Vogue that he\u2019s \u201calways loved her music.\u201d For Dion\u2019s part, when she first saw his fashion illustrations, she was so impressed \u201cshe started crying.\u201d He told Vogue that his favourite illustration that he has ever done is of Dion in \u201cthe Rodarte lace dress with the floral embroidery when she\u2019s holding a banana.\u201d\n\n2. They work very closely together Dion seems to be giving Mu\u00f1oz more to do in her show. In Marseille, they performed a seductive, handsy dance to Dion\u2019s chanson \u201cLe Ballet.\u201d Is this proof that where there\u2019s smoulder there\u2019s fire, or does she just feel safer getting sexy on stage with a man who will vogue with her at fashion shows? 3. They are inseparable According to French magazine Madame Figaro, fans frequently report seeing Mu\u00f1oz in Dion\u2019s company. They were photographed lunching together (with another guy) at the Museum of Decorative Arts\u2019 restaurant LouLou on July 7, where we can only presume Dion frequently burst into excerpts from \u201cBe Our Guest.\u201d\n\n4. 2017 is the year of C\u00e9line As they say in Dion-ese, a new day has come. Since her heroic show of grace and grief at Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil\u2019s January 2016 national funeral in Montreal, she\u2019s stridently turned a new page, mixing and mingling at events such as the Grammys, Billboard Music Awards and the Met Gala while dressed head-to-toe in the most dazzling designer looks.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\u201cMy energy feels younger, more dynamic, excited,\u201d Dion told @voguemagazine in a feature exclusively published on Instagram. \u201cEverything now feels like it is a first.\u201d Does that sound like a woman in love with a man-baby? Sure it does! Then again, maybe not. After all . . . 5.
