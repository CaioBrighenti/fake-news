For his eighth season of playing patriarch Frank Gallagher on Shameless, William H. Macy won the SAG Award for best actor in a comedy series at the 24th annual ceremony Sunday night in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cCouple of years ago, I was privy to a conversation with David Mamet, who is really my mentor and taught me everything I knew, was talking to a journalist and the journalist said, \u2018Actors have a weird job: [they] just tell lies for a living.\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, an actor\u2019s job is to tell the truth,'\u201d Macy recalled as he accepted his award. \u201cEven though our lines and the stories we\u2019re told are given to us by writers, it\u2019s our job, under those imaginary circumstances, to find the truth. And I think it\u2019s a glorious way to make a living, especially in this day and age when so many people either can\u2019t recognize the truth or don\u2019t think it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nFinally, Macy concluded by shouting to his wife, \u201cFelicity Huffman, I love you so much,\u201d and honoring their children.\n\nThis is Macy\u2019s third win in this category, on his fourth nomination for the role of Frank. The win makes Macy the first actor to claim the award two years in a row since Alec Baldwin\u2019s seven-year streak for 30 Rock.\n\nMacy beat out Anthony Anderson (black-ish), Aziz Ansari (Master of None), Larry David (Curb Your Enthusiasm), Sean Hayes (Will & Grace), and Marc Maron (GLOW) to take home the statue.\n\nSee the full list of winners from the 24th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards here.", "images": ["https://ew.com/img/streaming/netflix.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1148924365.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ouat-ts4-us.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1138984915-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bet.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1157866573.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tracy-morgan_credit-paul-mobley.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-818983310.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tina-fey-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/emmy-women.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tca.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-908512556.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1156593961.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2701px%2C1418.025px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/ali-stoker-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/iasip_1310_9787r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/amy-pohler.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1156599506.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1150406283-1.jpg?crop=92px%2C121px%2C2608px%2C1369px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/shameless_803_2243-r.jpg?crop=1089px%2C338px%2C359px%2C358px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/2311-136363.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tout-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/gettyimages-1157887505.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6eeced293de3b25cebd3d7472270c707?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/oscars-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-908512556.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christian Holub"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/william-h-macy-sag-awards-best-actor-comedy/", "title": "William H.
