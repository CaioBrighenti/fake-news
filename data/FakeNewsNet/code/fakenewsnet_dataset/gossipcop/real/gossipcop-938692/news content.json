Reynolds, who passed away in 2015.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a tough guy,\u201d the Deadpool 2 actor explains during a new interview with Mr. Porter. \u201cThis is not meant to be some sob story \u2014 everyone carries their own bad of rocks around and I am no different in that regard \u2014 but growing up in my house, it was never relaxing or easy.\u201d\n\nBut despite their complicated relationship, Reynolds, 41, says he has Lively to thank for helping him reconcile with his father, who died following a long term battle with Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cShe has a gift for foresight,\u201d Reynolds added.\n\nImage zoom Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\n\nRELATED: Ryan Reynolds Mourns Father\u2019s Death with Touching Photo Tribute: \u2018RIP Pops\u2019\n\nAlthough Reynolds didn\u2019t go into detail about how the father and son repaired their relationship, a symbol of their reconciliation lives on in the actor\u2019s 3-year-old daughter James, who the couple decided to name after his father.\n\n\u201cIt felt right,\u201d Reynolds said, adding that even though his dad passed away shortly after his daughter was born, \u201che got to see her, which makes me happy.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cAll family relationships come with some complications. For better or worse, all roads lead to here. At the end of the day, it\u2019s easier to focus on the good stuff than the bad.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?
