Also, Brie Bella began her journey back to a WWE ring, and Jim Neidhart was a terrible tenant. Also also, everyone still kind of generally thinks Lana is the pits. This becomes important later.\n\nAnd now, the most exceptional, sublime moments from the mid-season finale of Total Divas.\n\nAn Engagement Party In Cabo\n\nShare This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL\n\nDuring a photo shoot for BirdieBee, Brie lets Nikki in on the plan that she\u2019s throwing her an engagement party in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. This is the scene-setting for the entirety of this episode, which gets out of control extremely quickly. The Divas are going to _____! is a tried and true Total Divas trope, but this one might go down as being the most infamous. Everyone but Nia Jax heads down to Cabo in various groups, which brings us to our next point of order.\n\nIs An Engagement Party Without Nia Jax Even A Party At All?\n\nI have no idea why Jax couldn\u2019t make this trip, so Alexa is rolling solo, but gets some quality bonding time with Nikki, as they\u2019re the first two to arrive in Cabo. It goes without saying that we are massive, MASSIVE fans of real-life besties Nia and Alexa, but it\u2019s also nice to see how Alexa rolls with situations without her looking-out-for-Lexi\u2019s-best-interests muscle around.\n\nAlso, I can\u2019t help but wonder how differently some of the ensuing hijinks would have been affected HAD Nia been around to witness them and/or intervene.\n\nShe Thinks She\u2019s Quentin Tarantino\n\nBefore the Smackdown crew of Carmella, Naomi, Lana and Nattie get down to Cabo, they have to wrestle on Smackdown. While Nattie and Carmella are getting their makeup did, Nattie starts ranting about Lana, once again calling back the screaming argument Lana had with everyone in Florida about how they should work harder to get better at promos. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s Quentin Tarantino,\u201d says Nattie to Carmella, and it legit took me 30 seconds to understand what the hell she meant by that. At first I thought it was because of all the cussing Lana did. Then I thought maybe Lana was secretly super into feet. It finally dawned on me that Nattie was mocking Lana insisting she\u2019s super good at words/talking/writing, and picked QT as the example that came to her mind as an example of that. Incredible.\n\nWhile Nattie is shit-talking, Lana overhears and strolls up to Nattie, who doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s there. Nattie\u2019s makeup lady cringes for a while before Nattie finally looks at who\u2019s standing next to her AS SHE SAYS \u201cLana is just so much drama \u2014 \u201d and looks suitably shocked before giving her an \u201co hai.\u201d\n\nJust as a word of warning: this episode marks the turning point where Nattie becomes the greatest villain in television history. And yes, I listened to Byron Saxton on Smackdown Live this week.", "images": ["https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/grid_indie.jpg?w=300&h=210&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/russ-harden-jpg.jpeg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/nikki-bella-grimace.jpg?quality=100&w=650", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/unnamed-26.jpg?w=300&h=210&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/warren-grid-uproxx-2.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/beto-grid-uproxx-1.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/grid_rosalia_bts.jpg?w=300&h=210&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/warren-grid-uproxx-1.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=722969591073270&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/grid.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/sheeran.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/kanye-cole-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=300&h=210&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/mus-podcast-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=300&h=210&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ppwtk_ep5_01.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/spandex272.jpg?quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/grid_1999.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/grid_travel.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://cdn.flipboard.com/badges/flipboard_srsw.png", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/westbrook-harden-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/grid_milkshake.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ppwtk_ep004_b-real.still005.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/cardi-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/podcast1.gif?w=300&h=210&crop=1&quality=100", "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/grid_tarantino.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1&quality=100"], "top_img": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/nikki-bella-grimace.jpg?quality=100&w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Hanstock", "Zac Gelfand", "Chloe Gilke", "Derrick Rossignol", "Uproxx Music", "Zach Johnston", "Contributing Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/total-divas-season-7-episode-6-recap-midseason-finale/", "title": "The Most Outrageous \u2018Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1000,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "In which Nattie lives long enough to see herself become a villain.", "keywords": "prowrestling, sports, total divas, total divas recap, wwe total divas", "qc": {"post": "total-divas-season-7-episode-6-recap-midseason-finale", "author": "Bill Hanstock", "section": "prowrestling", "primary_tag": "total-divas"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPROXX", "creator": "@UPROXX", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The Most Outrageous \u2019Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week", "url": "https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/total-divas-season-7-episode-6-recap-midseason-finale/", "description": "In which Nattie lives long enough to see herself become a villain.", "site_name": "UPROXX", "image": {"identifier": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/nikki-bella-grimace.jpg?quality=100&w=650", "width": 650, "height": 400}, "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_GB"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-14T21:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-03-19T10:53:54+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX"}, "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "app_id": 117400151618132, "pages": 116548701336}, "robots": "index,follow", "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "application-name": "UPROXX", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Culture Of Now", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://uproxx.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/bae760df0e3bd64e122a0b36facaee58?s=16"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K9TT-spjSQ?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1513286100.0, "source": "https://uproxx.com", "summary": ""}
