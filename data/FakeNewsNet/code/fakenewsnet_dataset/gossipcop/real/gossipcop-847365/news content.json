This baby is our rainbow after the storm. I\u2019m super excited,\u201d Lowell told US. \u201cIt was a huge shock at first. We were not planning it, especially after the miscarriage and how I went downhill with my mental illness.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nShe added: \u201cWe were going to wait a really long time. We were using protection and everything and still got pregnant. This baby just wanted to be here. It was very unexpected.\u201d\n\nLowell previously announced she was pregnant on a January episode of Teen Mom OG. But just a few months later, the couple revealed she\u2019d had a miscarriage.\n\nLowell, who was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, went to rehab last November to seek treatment for suicidal thoughts, and then again in early January to overcome childhood trauma.\n\nLowell and Balteirra have been together for 13 years, celebrating their anniversary in July. Dating since middle school, the two 25-year-olds welcomed their first child, Carly, in the first season of MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant.\n\nThey placed Carly for adoption and continued to document their lives together for MTV\u2019s Teen Mom OG, welcoming Nova in 2015.\n\nThe Baltierras married at Castle Farms in Charlevoix, Michigan, eight months after their second daughter\u2019s birth.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teen Mom\u2018s Amber Portwood & Catelynn Lowell Baltierra Open Up About Their Mental Health Struggles\n\nCatelynn has been open about her fears of a second pregnancy because she experienced postpartum depression after the birth of Nova.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely been thinking about it and that\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s holding me back, honestly,\u201d she told PEOPLE of her battle with PPD. \u201cEspecially because they say if you\u2019ve had postpartum once, you have a higher chance of getting it with your next.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Nova, I thought it was severe because I struggled with anxiety already and panic attacks and depression,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that is definitely the thing that scares me the most. I want to have a big family and have a lot of kids, but it\u2019s scary. It\u2019s definitely scary.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/grechen-rossi.jpg",
