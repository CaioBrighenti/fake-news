Guests usually arrive in the early afternoon on Christmas Eve and exchange gifts. After their church outing on the big day, the royal family heads back to Sandringham House for a lunch of Norfolk turkey and other festivities.\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

Despite being engaged to William, in 2010 Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family. But, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn\u2019t have any family in the U.K. \u2014 and clearly Harry will have wanted his new fianc\u00e9e by his side.\n\nDespite reports that Prince William and Kate Middleton would likely be spending the holiday with Kate\u2019s family in Bucklebury, the couple will be joining the rest of the royal family. They will stay at their nearby home of Anmer Hall with children Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 3, and 8-month-old Prince Louis.\n\nImage zoom Kate Middleton, Prince William, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at Christmas 2017 Chris Jackson/Getty\n\nRELATED: Christmas with the Royals!

But contrary to those reports, a source tells PEOPLE that the couples enjoyed a memorable first Christmas together last year, when Meghan made her debut walk to church with the royal family on Christmas Day.\n\n\u201cThey really loved Christmas and all had a wonderful time,\u201d the source says. \u201cI think the two women got on \u2014 they are definitely not best friends, but it was a really special time for them all to spend together.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and Doria Ragland BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty\n\nOne person who won\u2019t be joining in the festivities? Meghan\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland.\n\nDespite previous reports that Doria was invited to spend Christmas with the royal family, PEOPLE confirms that the Los-Angeles based yoga instructor and social worker will not be in Norfolk.\n\nThe Middletons have never joined the royals for Christmas, but Kate and William decided to skip spending Christmas at Sandringham in 2016. Instead, they brought Prince George and Princess Charlotte to church with Kate\u2019s family in Englefield, England, near her childhood home.\n\nThe news comes shortly after PEOPLE confirmed that Doria will not be moving in when Meghan and Harry leave Kensington Palace for their new home at Windsor Castle\u2019s Frogmore Cottage next year. Doria may have rooms set aside for her in the cottage, located close to the house where Harry and Meghan\u2019s evening wedding party was held and where their engagement photos were taken about a year ago, but she\u2019s not making a permanent move there.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/newsletter.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2075px%2C1089.375px&resize=1200%2C630",
