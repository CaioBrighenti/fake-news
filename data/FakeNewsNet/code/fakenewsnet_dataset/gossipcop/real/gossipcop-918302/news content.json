Transparent co-stars Bradley Whitford and Amy Landecker are officially engaged. Landecker stars on the show as Sarah Pfefferman, while Whitford played the role of Magnus Hirschfeld from 2014 to 2015 on the Amazon series.\n\nThe exciting news was revealed at the 2018 Oscars on Sunday, when Get Out actor Whitford casually called Landecker his \"fianc\u00e9e\" during an interview with Ryan Seacrest, according to E! News .\n\n\"I walked out of the room and I said to my fianc\u00e9e, this is unlike any script I've ever read. This could be incredibly brilliant or it could really not work,\" Bradley said in his interview with Seacrest while discussing Get Out at the Academy Awards.\n\nLandecker has been spotted wearing a flashy diamond ring in her photos since the Screen Actors Guild Awards back in January. Additionally, Whitford's representative confirmed with E! News that the two are indeed engaged . The couple made an appearance at the 11th Annual Celebration of the 2018 Female Oscar Nominees at Crustacean on Friday, where again, Landecker showed off her engagement ring .\n\nWhitford, 58, and Landecker, 48, have been dating since the summer of 2015 when they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Creative Arts Emmys. \"Things with Amy are spectacular. Things are wonderful,\" Whitford previously shared with PEOPLE when they first began their relationship . \"I met her last year, but we didn't start dating for a little while. I work slowly. We never really acted together in this. So, that keeps it simple.\"\n\nLandecker added, \"I knew Bradley for a year before we dated and I kind of thought that he seemed like a cocky actor boy and I wasn't really that interested. Now I've learned that If I don't like someone at first, that's probably a sign that they're perfect for me because my taste is so bad \u2026 so I was like, \u2018Oh, see here it is!' I didn't think and now I'm the happiest I've ever been.\"\n\nSee more: All the Celebrities Who Have Gotten Engaged This Year...So Far!", "images": ["https://media.brides.com/photos/5b95aec53ce6f5474b2c9f50/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-957866438.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5c4cf0428b27912d65777132/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-1124488782.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a9d594a84df1308c0b3a7db/master/pass/GettyImages-903978076.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a9d594a84df1308c0b3a7db/1:1/w_767/GettyImages-903978076.jpg", "https://media.brides.com/photos/5b718d673c384c3f72d00ac8/1:1/w_125/GettyImages-988807958.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/images/brides-logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a9d594a84df1308c0b3a7db/master/pass/GettyImages-903978076.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/transparent-co-stars-bradley-whitford-and-amy-landecker-are-engaged", "title": "Transparent Co-Stars Bradley Whitford and Amy Landecker Are Engaged", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After years of working together, Bradley Whitford and Amy Landecker of the Amazon series 'Transparent' are set to tie the knot.", "og": {"description": "From scene partners to life partners!", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a9d594a84df1308c0b3a7db/master/pass/GettyImages-903978076.jpg", "title": "Transparent's Bradley Whitford and Amy Landecker Are Engaged", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/transparent-co-stars-bradley-whitford-and-amy-landecker-are-engaged", "site_name": "brides", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From scene partners to life partners!", "image": "https://media.brides.com/photos/5a9d594a84df1308c0b3a7db/master/pass/GettyImages-903978076.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "title": "Transparent's Bradley Whitford and Amy Landecker Are Engaged", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/transparent-co-stars-bradley-whitford-and-amy-landecker-are-engaged", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brides", "site": "brides"}, "fb": {"page_id": 50416192591, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}, "keywords": "News", "news_keywords": "News & Advice,News & Celebrity,News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
