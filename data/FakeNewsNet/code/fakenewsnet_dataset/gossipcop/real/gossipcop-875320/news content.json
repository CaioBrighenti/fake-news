There's no denying the reality TV star looked insanely glam during her entire season of The Bachelorette, but like most people, she loves her comfy clothes, too. There's one brand of T-shirts Lindsay has been \"living in\" over the past few weeks, and you're going to want to know the secret behind all the comfy oversized tees and tanks she's been rocking on social media lately.\n\nLindsay first clued fans into her fave brand on Instagram in July, and she's been spotted sporting the tees and tanks several times since. So what's the brand? It's Los Angeles-based Bad Decision Adventure Club, which sells organic, eco-friendly, unisex, made-in-LA clothing at its website, welikebad.com.\n\nLindsay is a fan of the brand's peach oversized Johnny Tee and Johnny Muscle Tank, both of which are made with a super soft jersey material. The oversized fit looks adorable half-tucked into shorts or jeans, but it also means that Lindsay can actually wear the pieces as a dress, too. Talk about versatile.\n\nThe first time Lindsay sported the Johnny Tee was on Instagram on July 18, and she shouted out the brand in the comments. How cute does it look half-tucked with her ripped black skinnies and peep-toe booties?\n\nThe very next day, she was spotted at Disneyland wearing the Johhny Muscle Tank from the same collection. It's just as stylish with leopard print mouse ears and cut-offs, but most importantly, it's comfy AF.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, she posted a pic of her wearing the same Johnny Tee in peach in the back of a car between appearances with her brand new fiance Bryan Abasolo. This time, she wore the oversized tee as a dress. It looks like the perfect loungewear for when you're between dresses. Here's where you can get both.\n\nThe Johnny Tee in Peach, $140, welikebad.com\n\nBased on how it's styled here, it's clear this shirt can do double duty as a dress.\n\nThe Johnny Muscle Tee in Peach, $130, welikebad.com\n\nThe wide armholes of this muscle tank make it the perfect shirt to wear over a flirty bralette.\n\nIt looks like Lindsay's Bad Decision Adventure Club tees are already a go-to in her wardrobe, and I can't blame her for re-wearing shirts as comfy as these look.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/10/da95aece-ea5d-47dc-a2a2-fc23a22f7f9b-screen-shot-2017-08-09-at-81543-pm.png?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format&q=70", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.bustle.com/bustle/production/public/loading-d7a38c.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/10/8599fbd1-d3b5-47d6-9d77-62705dbe524b-johnny_tank_blush-2_1024x1024.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/10/da95aece-ea5d-47dc-a2a2-fc23a22f7f9b-screen-shot-2017-08-09-at-81543-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/10/d83e1311-540b-4c8c-9d10-14e303e2f976-johnny_lng_blush-1.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/10/582d3184-2ce9-43f6-98a3-109b5382aa27-image1-2.PNG?w=646&fit=max&auto=format&q=70", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/10/da95aece-ea5d-47dc-a2a2-fc23a22f7f9b-screen-shot-2017-08-09-at-81543-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/rachel-lindsay-is-obsessed-with-this-la-based-t-shirt-brand-75675", "title": "Rachel Lindsay Is Obsessed With This LA-Based T-Shirt Brand", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@bustle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 132694503601208}, "og": {"site_name": "Bustle", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/rachel-lindsay-is-obsessed-with-this-la-based-t-shirt-brand-75675", "type": "article", "title": "The 'Bachelorette's Rachel Lindsay Is Obsessed With This T-Shirt Brand", "description": "If you're a fan of The Bachelorette, chances are good you're used to seeing Rachel Lindsay in sparkly gowns with long, perfectly styled hair and of course those gorgeous flirty false eyelashes.
