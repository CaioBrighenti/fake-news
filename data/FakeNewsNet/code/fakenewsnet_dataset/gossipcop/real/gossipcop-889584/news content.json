Kicking off in San Diego on Feb. 26, the tour will make stops in Dallas, Brooklyn, Boston, Miami and more U.S. cities through March 31.\n\nWhile a Demi Lovato tour is exciting enough in itself, the singer also announced that DJ Khaled will be supporting her on the trek -- something he's pretty stoked about. \"They didnt want us to go on tour together\u2026 #werecomingforyou,\" Khaled wrote on social media. \"FAN LUV SEE YOU SOON !\"\n\nThey didnt want us to go on tour together\u2026 #werecomingforyou #demixkhaled @ddlovato. Pre sale begins October 30th! demixkhaled.com FAN LUV SEE YOU SOON ! A post shared by DJ KHALED (@djkhaled) on Oct 26, 2017 at 12:07pm PDT\n\n\n\nCan't imagine a Lovato/Khaled team-up? Well, Lovato and Khaled have already given fans a taste of what their tour will be like at the iHeartRadio Music Festival -- the \"I'm the One\" mastermind surprised the crowd with the pop diva to sing her hit \"Sorry Not Sorry\" during his fest-closing set on Sept. 24 -- and it's quite epic, if we have anything to say about it.\n\nLovato just celebrated her second No. 1 on the Pop Songs chart thanks to \"Sorry Not Sorry,\" which reached the peak spot this week on the Nov. 4-dated chart. The song is the lead single from the singer's latest LP, Tell Me You Love Me, which was released Sept. 29.\n\nCheck out the dates and cities for #demixkhaled below.\n\nFeb. 26 -- San Diego, CA @ Viejas Arena\n\nFeb. 28 -- San Jose, CA @ SAP Center\n\nMarch 2 -- Inglewood, CA @ The Forum\n\nMarch 3 -- Las Vegas, NV @ MGM Grand Garden Arena\n\nMarch 4 -- Phoenix, AZ @ Talking Stick Resort Arena\n\nMarch 7 -- Dallas, TX @ American Airlines Center\n\nMarch 9 -- Rosemont, IL @ Allstate Arena\n\nMarch 10 -- Minneapolis, MN @ Target Center\n\nMarch 13 -- Detroit, MI @ Little Caesars Arena\n\nMarch 14 -- Columbus, OH @ Schottenstein Center\n\nMarch 16 -- Brooklyn, NY @ Barclays Center\n\nMarch 17 -- Montreal, QC @ Bell Centre\n\nMarch 19 -- Toronto, ON @ Air Canada Centre\n\nMarch 21 -- Newark, NJ @ Prudential Center\n\nMarch 23 -- Philadelphia, PA @ Wells Fargo Center\n\nMarch 24 -- Washington, DC @ Capital One Arena\n\nMarch 26 -- Boston, MA @ TD Garden\n\nMarch 28 -- Nashville, TN @ Bridgestone Arena\n\nMarch 30 -- Miami, FL @ American Airlines Arena\n\nMarch 31 -- Tampa, FL @ Amalie Arena", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/nav-cover-topcrop/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://assets.billboard.com/assets/1562696694/images/Billboard-white.svg?7c321b89f5a705673407", "https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/magazine_cover/public/media/jobs-cov-bb16-2019-uxnsk-billboard-400.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/demi-lovato-live-2017-g-billboard-1548.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/files/media/demi-lovato-live-2017-g-billboard-1548.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8014799/demi-lovato-tour-dates-cities-north-america-dj-khaled", "title": "Demi Lovato Announces 2018 North American Tour Dates With DJ Khaled", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "title": "Demi Lovato Tour: See the North American Dates For 2018", "description": "Lovatics will get the chance to tell Demi Lovato they love her in 2018 -- the superstar is hitting the road in support of her album Tell Me You Love Me early next year.
