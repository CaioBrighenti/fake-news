He came across just like a brother trying to connect with his sister and it really wasn\u2019t that different than if I were connecting any random person to their brother,\u201d the 22-year-old medium continued. \u201cAnd it was just really special because it showed universally these connections are all something we can relate to. And even if we\u2019re a celebrity in life, they still connect on a personal level on the other side.\u201d\n\nConclusive proof that these dead celebrities are ALIVE?
