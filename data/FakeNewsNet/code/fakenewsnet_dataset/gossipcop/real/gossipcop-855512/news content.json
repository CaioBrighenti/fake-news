I did really good!\u201d Hunt, 32, said on E!\u2019s Live from the Red Carpet in Las Vegas.\n\nImage zoom John Shearer/Getty\n\nThe country crooner married Fowler in an intimate Georgia ceremony in April, and he gushed about his newest accessory: his wedding band.\n\n\u201cIt feels great \u2014 there\u2019s a spiritual strength to it [the ring], and I feel a little bit taller now that I\u2019m wearing it,\u201d he told E! News.\n\nCheck out PEOPLE\u2019s full 2017 Billboard Music Awards coverage.\n\nJust weeks before the singer\u2019s wedding day, he attended the Academy of Country Music Awards, where he surprise-serenaded his bride-to-be. Mid-way through his performance of \u201cBody Like a Back Road,\u201d Hunt ditched the stage and joined an adorably embarrassed Fowler in the audience.\n\nFROM PEN: Grammy News and Notes: Album of the Year Nominees\n\n\u201cI told her that I might come down and sing to her; I don\u2019t think she knew I was going to plop down next to her,\u201d he added of the ACM performance.\n\n\u201cI had to nudge her over; she didn\u2019t want to scoot over! She finally did. It was her first time to an awards show like that, and this is her second one, so I just wanted to throw her into the deep end. But she came out, and after that she was so much more comfortable even though she didn\u2019t enjoy those 30 seconds very much!\u201d", "images":
