Her bridesmaids wore floral head wreaths, while the flower girls clutched baskets made by Lipinski\u2019s mom, Pat.\n\n\u201cI feel so lucky that I get to spend the rest of my life loving my best friend and love of my life,\u201d Lipinski said shortly after they became engaged in Dec. 2015.\n\nImage zoom Sylvie Gil Photography\n\nThe guests arrived two days prior to the wedding for a pre-ceremony celebration at Boone Hall in Mount Pleasant, where Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds tied the knot in 2012.\n\nImage zoom JOHN AND JOSEPH PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nLipinski, a sports commentator for NBC, had her closest friends in her bridal party, including fellow figure skater and BFF Johnny Weir as her \u201cbridesman.\u201d\n\nOther guests included Bob and Jill Costas, Andrea Joyce and her former Olympics coach.\n\nWatch the People Weddings: Tara Lipinski & Todd Kapostasy special Wednesday, June 28 on the new People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN).

Highlights included chicken and waffles two ways (fried chicken in a waffle cone with maple bacon remoulade and fried chicken on mini waffles) for an appetizer and local fish as a main course.\n\nThe lush floral arrangements were designed by Jackson Durham Events.\n\n\u201cI had a vision, because I love a very soft romantic palette so lots of creams, light colors, touches of green with flowers,\u201d Lipinski told PEOPLE in the weeks leading up the event. \u201cSo we have orchids and roses on roses on roses.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stunned by how beautiful it is,\u201d she also said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019ll also incorporate lanterns and arches to give the wedding an ultra-romantic vibe.\u201d\n\nThe couple met in May 2015 when Lipinski presented Kapostasy an award at the Sports Emmys. Months later, Lipinski shared the news of their engagement on Instagram with a picture of her stunning diamond ring.\n\nAnd in May, the newlyweds broke from tradition in favor of a four-day joint bachelor-bachelorette destination f\u00eate in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have the urge to go to Vegas or Miami or do anything crazy like that, I just wanted to be with Todd and all of our friends together,\u201d Lipinski said. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy we did a joint party, because a lot of our friends hadn\u2019t met before and now we have four days of great memories to talk about at the wedding.\n\n\u201cIt was a wedding pregame!\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/9.jpg?crop=0px%2C99px%2C1630px%2C855px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/womens-soccer-10.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sambird1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1161288660.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ali-krieger.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1080px%2C568px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1155364718.jpg?crop=0px%2C388px%2C2685px%2C1411px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tara-lipinski1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1161293031.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-926956638.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-01-at-11.00.58-AM.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/alexmorgan.jpg?crop=290px%2C47px%2C2410px%2C1266px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/brandy-chastain.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/social-7.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/albert-haynesworth.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ciara-russell-wilson.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tara-lipinski-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/filippo-magnini-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/lamar-odom-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tara-lipinski1.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1500px%2C787px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tara-lipinski-2.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9f59f825ce986bce85263e58884769ad?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1161282992.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gettyimages-1161294669.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/serena-williams.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/womens-soccer-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tara-lipinski1.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1500px%2C787px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rose Minutaglio"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/sports/tara-lipinski-marries-todd-kapostasy/", "title": "Tara Lipinski Is Married!
