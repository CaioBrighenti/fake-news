She also gravitates towards the Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance Palette and holds onto her makeup artist Hrush Achemyan\u2019s Tarte palette (which was a limited edition launch a few years ago).", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/ashley-tisdale-1.jpg?w=576", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/lucy-hale.jpg?w=768",
