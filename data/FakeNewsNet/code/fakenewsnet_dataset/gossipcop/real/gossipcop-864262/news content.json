Now that the chaos between Calvin and Taylor has finally subdued, the Scottish DJ can, at last, relax and come to terms with the past.\n\nWhen talking to GQ Magazine for the United Kingdom, Harris explained that going on his Twitter rant was an ill-informed knee-jerk reaction, and he\u2019s sorry about it.\n\nFor the people who don\u2019t remember, he said, \u201cI figure if you\u2019re happy with your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex-BF down for something to do.\u201d\n\nIn the sit down with the magazine, Harris claimed he was merely defending his music, and what he\u2019s good at.\n\nIn the interview, he explained, \u201cit was completely the wrong instinct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt like things were piling on top of me and that was when I snapped.\u201d\n\nHarris said to the magazine that during his time with Swift, he felt their relationship was getting the spotlight rather than his music.\n\nHe added that the split between the two pop stars was more publicized than their actual relationship.\n\nThe DJ explained, \u201cIt\u2019s challenging when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly. The aftermath of the relationship was way more heavily publicized than the relationship itself. When we were together, we were cautious for it not to be a media circus.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that the \u201cTwitter thing\u201d was a result of him succumbing to pressure, and becoming weak at the last second.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for why they broke up, a lot of it had to do with the media bombardment that surrounded their romance. It never seemed to stop, and the man explained, that it was just the \u201cwrong situation\u201d for the both of them.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Weeknd-Selena-Gomez-Spanish-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Scooter-and-Justin-JewishJournal.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/02-nicki-minaj-cardi-b-collage-2018-billboard-1548-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Taylor-Swift-Grammy.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Toya-Wright-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Keyshia-Cole-Fashion-1-300x244.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/kylie-jenner-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scooter-braun-justin-bieber-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Calvin-Harris-e1498783321756.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Calvin-Harris-e1498783321756.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "Charisse Van Horn", "Lynn Gintonio", "Ann Mose", "Gloria Meredith"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/calvin-harris-reveals-why-he-snapped-before-ranting-about-taylor-swift-on-twitter-47565/", "title": "Calvin Harris Reveals Why He \u201cSnapped\u201d Before Ranting About Taylor Swift On Twitter", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "calvin harris, taylor swift,", "keywords": "celebrity news, calvin harris, taylor swift,", "description": "Calvin Harris has a few regrets, and it's only normal because he's human right?
