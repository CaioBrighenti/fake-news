This year I really just feel like I am myself again and happy and healthy in all aspects of my life.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cI am just really happy. Your mental state is honestly the biggest part about the whole process and the body kind of comes with being excited to work out.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Corbis/Getty\n\nTo prepare, the model says she\u2019s been \u201cworking out a ton\u201d and maintains a healthy diet, but doesn\u2019t stop herself from enjoying the foods she loves.\n\nLooking for more style content?

I\u2019m still eating things that I want to eat, but you know, not pizza everyday!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Corbis/Getty\n\nHadid will be rejoined by sister Gigi Hadid at tonight\u2019s show, after she dropped out of the 2017 Shanghai show at the last minute. And Hadid says it is so special to have her older sister by her side.\n\nRELATED: Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show 2018 Model Roster: Who\u2019s In and Who\u2019s Out?\n\n\u201cIt is just insane. Even part of the show we\u2019re standing close to each other for the finale and it is just exciting to be able to hold her hand,\u201d Hadid says. \u201cIf I feel anything I can just look at her and we can make a joke and laugh. That is just what I am most excited about.\u201d\n\nEven though 2018 marks Hadid\u2019s third time down the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show runway, the star says her nerves are just the same. \u201cIt is so funny because yesterday I was so fine. Then I woke up this morning with all of the butterflies. I thought I was going to be the lucky one that didn\u2019t have the butterflies, but it still comes to you,\u201d Hadid tells us.\n\nJust days before the show, Hadid clapped back at critics and defended her body shape when many accused her of looking too thin in photos she shared from her Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show fitting. Many commenters found her lingerie-clad photos \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSkin and bone. That second page is quite frankly disturbing,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cI have nothing against being slim but this is unhealthy on so many levels. Shame on @victoriassecret for encouraging and promoting this totally unrealistic image. We must put an end to the concept of looks = value.\u201d\n\nHadid didn\u2019t reply to commenters directly, but she altered her original caption of the photo with a reaction to the backlash.\n\n\u201c@victoriassecret fittings today\ud83d\udc9bi can\u2019t wait for you to see all of the beautiful outfits \u2026i\u2019m so grateful to be a part of the show again, feeling happier and healthier than ever\ud83d\udda4 (all body types are different and react differently to a great workout routine and a healthy diet\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf1f)\u201d\n\nThe 2018 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion show will air Dec. 2 at 10 p.m. on ABC.\n\n\u2014 with reporting by Brittany Talarico", "images":
