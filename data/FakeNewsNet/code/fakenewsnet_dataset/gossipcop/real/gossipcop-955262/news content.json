Owusu-Breen writes the original show and characters \u201ccan\u2019t be replaced.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is only one Buffy,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut here we are, twenty years later\u2026 And the world seems a lot scarier. So maybe, it could be time to meet a new Slayer.\u201d\n\nThe new Buffy version is being described as a \u201ccontemporary\u201d and \u201crichly diverse\u201d take on the original series, building on the mythology of the original and using aspects of it to comment on aspects of the current political and cultural climates. Sources say that the reboot will cast a black actress in the titular role. Original series creator Joss Whedon is also on board as a producer. But there\u2019s no network on board as of yet.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/big-little-lies2.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/buffy.jpg?crop=952px%2C3px%2C1748px%2C1748px&resize=150%2C150", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/the-loudest-voice.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vds1-101-110617-0868.jpg?crop=0px%2C161px%2C2452px%2C1287px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/oliver.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/mascara-tears.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/lennykravitz.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/the-hills-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ew.com/img/icons/generic-image.svg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/celebrity-binge.jpg?w=768", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/remini.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8507038badc1c41adb48fd6b51538fbd?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/rolestout.jpg?w=768", "https://ew.com/img/streaming/hulu.png", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/000260635.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/black-lady-sketch-comedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C282px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-1.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/b002_c013_1107fg_001.1675300r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/a27_promo_stills_022519.0041_r.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/i-will-remember-you-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3000px%2C1575px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/2000x1320_2862_ewk_strangerthings.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spanish-princess-e.jpg", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bll-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sn2-1680r-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C316px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/finn-noah.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1678px%2C881px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/angel-season-5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/000260635.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/07/26/buffy-reboot-writer/", "title": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot writer responds to fan backlash", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The writer behind the reboot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer is assuring fans that the new version in development won't\u2026", "og": {"title": "'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' reboot writer responds to fan backlash", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/07/26/buffy-reboot-writer/", "description": "'There is only one Buffy.'
