No one else was home at the time.\n\nThe burglars reportedly got into the home through a window or door on an upper floor. A ladder was apparently found in the backyard.\n\nDozens of celebrities have been hit by burglars this year, including David Spade, Jaime Pressly, Ronda Rousey, former Lakers Coach Byron Scott, Jason Derulo, Emmy Rossum, Dodgers star Yasiel Puig, Nicki Minaj, and Alanis Morisette, at their homes from West Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley.", "images":
