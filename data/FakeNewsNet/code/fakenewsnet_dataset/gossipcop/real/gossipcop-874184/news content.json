She even emailed her (now former) friend to beg for her husband back:\n\n\u201cI am dying, and I can\u2019t take it any more. This is killing me. Have mercy,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt was largely speculated that Twain\u2019s huge musical hiatus \u2014 her last full-length album Up! was released back in 2002 \u2014 was due to the loss of Lange from her life, the man who had been her co-producer for all of the singer\u2019s biggest hits.\n\nHowever, her new single proves those critics wrong.\n\nThe lyrics to Life\u2019s About To Get Good are painfully truthful and have been praised by her thousands of fans.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t just broken, I was shattered / I trusted you so much, you\u2019re all that mattered.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t move on and I think you were flattered / Though it\u2019s time to forget you, forever,\u201d she sings.\n\nYou can watch the whole comeback below.", "images":
