In 2016, Serena Williams, Yoko Ono, Patti Smith and Amy Schumer modeled for spread. In 2017, actresses Julianne Moore, Uma Thurman, Robin Wright and Nicole Kidman went au naturel for their shoot. And in 2018, Alice in Wonderland was remade with an all-black cast that included Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Naomi Campbell, RuPaul, Sean \u201cPuff Daddy\u2019\u201d Combs among others. So what\u2019s in store for 2019? We have all the info on the newest calendar (and it\u2019s buzzy stars!), below.\n\nThe 2019 calendar lineup features model Gigi Hadid with designer Alexander Wang, Dirty John actress Julia Garner, American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Misty Copeland with American Ballet Theatre dancer Calvin Royal III and French actress and model Laetitia Casta.\n\nThe 46th edition of the calendar was shot by Albert Watson and meant to look like film stills. \u201cEach character has a part to play in the 2019 Pirelli Calendar,\u201d Watson explained. \u201cIn some cases, the role was close to what the actress does for a living, but here they were certainly all acting a part. Not themselves. And that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d\n\nThe theme of the collection is titled \u201cdreams\u201d because each woman is focused on their future in the stills. \u201cThe basic idea behind the whole project is that of telling a story in four \u2018little movies,'\u201d Watson said.\n\nImage zoom Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar\n\nFor Hadid\u2019s part, she played a woman who just broke up with her companion (don\u2019t worry \u2014 IRL she\u2019s still with Zayn Malik).\n\n\u201cShe has a confidant, not a boyfriend, played by the designer Alexander Wang,\u201d said Watson. \u201cHe is helping her get over this difficult time. I think there\u2019s a degree of angst in these images. With Gigi Hadid\u2019s character, I wanted to convey the sense of a woman thinking about her future, but also showing her in a situation of loneliness.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/684440673e7de9e6288f8fd2fb40dc8a?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/10_gig-hadid.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/37_laetitia-casta.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/26_misty-copeland-calvin-royal-iii.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/10_gig-hadid.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/01_gigi-hadid.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/27_misty-copeland.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/17_julia-garner.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/08gigi-hadid-alexander-wang.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/10_gig-hadid.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/2019-pirelli-calendar-gigi-hadid-misty-copeland/", "title": "Gigi Hadid, Misty Copeland Headline 2019 Pirelli Calendar: See the Gorgeous Photos!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Fashion,Gigi Hadid,Misty Copeland,Models,News,Style News", "news_keywords": "Fashion,Gigi Hadid,Misty Copeland,Models,News,Style News", "description": "Photographer Albert Watson shot this year's iconic Pirelli Calendar\u00a0spread", "og": {"title": "Gigi Hadid, Misty Copeland Headline 2019 Pirelli Calendar: See the Gorgeous Photos!", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/2019-pirelli-calendar-gigi-hadid-misty-copeland/", "description": "Photographer Albert Watson shot this year's iconic Pirelli Calendar\u00a0spread", "image": {"identifier": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/10_gig-hadid.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/2019-pirelli-calendar-gigi-hadid-misty-copeland/", "description": "Photographer Albert Watson shot this year's iconic Pirelli Calendar\u00a0spread", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/10_gig-hadid.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/2019-pirelli-calendar-gigi-hadid-misty-copeland/", "title": "Gigi Hadid, Misty Copeland Headline 2019 Pirelli Calendar: See the Gorgeous Photos!", "description": "Photographer Albert Watson shot this year's iconic Pirelli Calendar\u00a0spread", "site": "@people", "image": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/10_gig-hadid.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
