But the couple separated in 2016, several months before he began dating the SkinnyGirl mogul. (In a statement to PEOPLE, Jill said, \u201cWe are all heartbroken. Dennis was, and will always be, the love of my life. His spirit lives on in our children. Please respect our family\u2019s privacy at this time.\u201d)\n\nIn 2013, Frankel filed for divorce from ex-husband Jason Hoppy, with whom she shares 8-year-old daughter Bryn.\n\nOn camera, Frankel always seemed hesitant to define the nature of her relationship with Shields.\n\nImage zoom Alessio Botticelli/GC\n\n\u201cDennis and I have a very independent relationship. Everyone wants us to define what it is, it\u2019s not definable,\u201d Frankel said during the fourth episode of the current RHONY season, in which Shields made a cameo.\n\n\u201cWe love each other but the two of us have schedules that are off the charts insane. I\u2019m okay with it being totally gray,\u201d the mother of one said of her boyfriend, who told her costars that they met in 1988.\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode, the couple seemed to be on a break.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say this to Dennis, but in my own mind I said 90 days. I\u2019m not saying a word to Dennis for 90 days,\u201d Frankel told friend Dorinda Medley. \u201cIt\u2019s a really hard thing to realize that someone you love doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the right person. I wish he was.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Bravo\n\nIn May, Frankel opened up about their complex relationship \u2014 without naming Shields \u2014 on Steve Harvey\u2018s talk show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been with someone on and off for years,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a partnership where if we\u2019re not being teammates and it\u2019s not working and one man is down, then the other man is down. We\u2019re trying to really kind of be good partners and be good teammates and I think relationships oddly are \u2014 and this sounds cold \u2014 but a little bit like business.\u201d\n\nFrankel added, \u201cIf both people aren\u2019t happy about it but slightly uncomfortable and giving up something or giving in [to] something, it doesn\u2019t work. So both partners have to say, \u2018All right, I\u2019m in it for this.\u2019 And I think we might be at that point, believe it or not,\u201d she added. \u201cI haven\u2019t said that to anyone yet.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Bethenny Frankel and Dennis Shields in December 2016 Josiah Kamau/BuzzFoto via Getty\n\nDespite multiple breakups throughout the years, Frankel and Shields remained close friends.\n\n\u201cBethenny and her daughter Bryn love Dennis and his family and they have been a support system during her negative divorce and a positive influence in Bryn\u2019s life,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cThey had a 27-year friendship before they dated so they picked that up where they left off once they realized they didn\u2019t work as a couple,\u201d the source said. \u201cHer daughter adores him and his family, and she comes first above all.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Bethenny Frankel Says She \u2018Never Knows Exactly\u2019 Where Relationship Stands with On-Again, Off-Again Boyfriend\n\nFrankel and Shields\u2019 relationship was also a talking point during the two most recent RHONY reunions.\n\nIn 2016, Luann de Lesseps criticized Frankel for dating a married man, and in 2017, Frankel confirmed she was dating Shields again after a five-month break.\n\n\u201cI am with Dennis,\u201d she told Andy Cohen and the rest of the ladies during the season 9 reunion. \u201cIt\u2019s more than giving it another shot. Things had to be dealt with and sort of a gauntlet needed to be gotten through and it happened. I\u2019m in a better place. And I\u2019m in a better place to make a sane decision.\u201d\n\nAs for why they split in early 2017, Frankel explained, \u201cI rightfully ended the relationship because of some of the circumstances surrounding my divorce and surrounding his divorce. A person that\u2019s been married that many years needs to go through a certain cycle. I think that I needed him to make changes that I really didn\u2019t think he would make. And I think that thinking the possibility of losing me really scared him straight, to be honest.\u201d", "images":
