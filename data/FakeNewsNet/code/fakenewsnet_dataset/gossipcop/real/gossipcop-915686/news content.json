Sitting right here,\u201d Harrison says, as he gestures to her fellow cast members, inviting \u201cthe mystery man in Clare\u2019s life\u201d to stand up.\n\nAnd although Ben Higgins chooses that moment to dramatically uncross\u2014 and then re-cross \u2014 his legs, the clip ends before revealing which guy Clare found love with.\n\nRELATED: Did Dean Unglert Propose to Lesley Murphy on the
