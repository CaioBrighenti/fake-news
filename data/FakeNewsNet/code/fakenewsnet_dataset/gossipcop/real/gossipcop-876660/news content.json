The new docuseries will premiere in October, and a new video has been released to show off the new series.\n\n\u201cE! gives viewers an all-access pass into the lives of music\u2019s leading ladies when its new docs-series The Platinum Life premieres on Sunday, October 15 at 10pm ET/PT. In the eight, hour-long episodes, viewers follow Asiah Collins, Alycia Bella, La\u2019Myia Good, Shantel Jackson, Nazanin Mandi, Lola Monroe and Crystal Smith as they indulge in the VIP life with their significant others who happen to be some of the biggest names in the music industry including Nelly, Eric Bellinger and more. While juggling their own careers and making a name for themselves, these women are headstrong and won\u2019t let anything stand in the way from achieving success. However, living in the spotlight comes with rules that all ladies have to follow. Will they fall in line or march to the beat of their own drum?\n\nMEET THE LEADING LADIES:\n\nAsiah Collins (Married to multi-platinum recording artist, songwriter and producer Kid Ink)\n\nAsiah, the youngest woman in the circle of friends, is working to find the balance in her life between having fun and being responsible. She\u2019s faced with figuring out how to juggle all of her responsibilities as of her career and being a mom to her daughter with husband, Kid Ink. Asiah is a loyal friend and expects the same from others, but she continues to butt heads with Crystal over past unresolved issues.\n\nAlycia Bella (Newly single)\n\nAlycia Bella is a singer, actress, aspiring DJ and all around firecracker. With looks that could kill and a seemingly sweet demeanor, don\u2019t let her fool you as, while she\u2019s made it known that she\u2019s respectful, she\u2019ll come for you if you send for her. Being the only single one of the group adds to the stress but Alycia is trying to date through trial and error.\n\nLa\u2019Myia Good (Married to Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, and producer Eric Bellinger)\n\nLa\u2019Myia has a lot on her plate right now. She\u2019s busy managing her career, balancing her philanthropy, being a mom and keeping the romance red hot with her husband Eric Bellinger. Unlike some of the other women, La\u2019Myia has been in the entertainment industry since the age of seven along with her sister, actress Meagan Good. She has an unapologetic personality and confronts issues head on, especially when it comes to her best friend Crystal.\n\nShantel Jackson (In a relationship with Grammy Award-winning rapper, singer, songwriter and producer Nelly)\n\nNow in a relationship with Nelly, Shantel finally feels like they are united and in a great place together. Nelly just purchased a new home in Los Angeles for the two of them and has been hinting to Shantel that having a baby would be a great next step in their relationship. However, Shantel is more focused on taking her career to the next level and wants to put babies on hold.\n\nNazanin Mandi (Engaged to Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter and producer Miguel)\n\nAfter 11 years of ups and downs with the love of her life, Nazanin is now officially engaged to Miguel and she\u2019s currently in the process of planning her own high-profile celebrity wedding next spring. Nazanin is not only planning her wedding, but managing and expanding her bikini brand, modeling and working on her singing career.\n\nLola Monroe (In a relationship with rapper, songwriter and producer, King Los)\n\nAfter being nominated for Best Female Hip Hop Artist at the BET Awards, Lola Monroe took a 3-year hiatus from the spotlight in order to be super-mom to son Brixton. Now, Lola wants to get things back on track with her career and take the music industry by storm. Stakes are at an all-time high as this comeback is a \u201cmake or break\u201d time for her. With that in mind, her long-time boyfriend King Los will now have to take on some of her household and parenting duties.\n\nCrystal Smith (Married to Multi-Grammy Award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and actor, NE-YO)\n\nCrystal is married to NE-YO, but as the newest member to The Platinum Life lifestyle, Crystal still has a lot to learn. She seems determined to buck the rules and live life exactly how she wants to live it. While Crystal\u2019s unfiltered point of view definitely ruffles some feathers within the group, she is laser-focused on her cooking channel and taking her business to the next level.\n\nTo learn more about the show, follow: Twitter \u2013 @PlatinumLifeOnE Instagram \u2013 @PlatinumLifeOnE Facebook \u2013 @ThePlatinumLifeOnE\n\n\u201cThe Platinum Life\u201d is produced by STXtv and Tower 2 Productions with Ryan Holcomb, Jason Goldberg, Shanta Conic, and Kim McKoy serving as executive producers.\u201d", "images": ["https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wags-renewed-season-three-cancelled-renewed-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/salvation03-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/eric-and-jessie-e-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eric-and-jessie-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/status05-15-590x59.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/E-logo-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/TOTALDUIVAS-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/howtogetawaywithmurder12-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/the-inbetween-season-1-ratings-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/adultswim-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/showtime-the-circus-logo-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/life-of-kylie-e-tv-shows-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/grantchester-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/13-reasons-why-netflix-tv-show-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/723832_770x517-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/scream24-88x66.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=48&d=identicon&r=pg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/freeform11-e1516365924321-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/taketwo01-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/assets/img/captcha-loading.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shadesofblue06-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/themes/tvseriesfinale/images/logo.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/first-responders-live-fox-season-1-ratings-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-platinum-life-e-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/the-arrangement-e-canceled-or-renewed-c-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mariahs-World-TV-show-on-E-season-one-premiere-canceled-or-renewed-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/utils/captcha/captcha.php?key=c5d29f9806ffe9", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/utils/captcha/captcha.php?key=c5d29f98070186", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2018-19-canceled-tv-shows-2-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/agents-of-shield-6x09-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2019-02-18-18.45.21-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/shutterstock_461134543-88x66.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d9rW5j9yWlTO2.gif", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-01-at-3.11.23-PM-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ransom-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/masterchef-season-10-ratings-fox-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shooter03-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/quantico09-88x66.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=40&d=identicon&r=pg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mariahs-world-tv-series-on-e-season-one-premiere-cancelled-or-renewed-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/euphoria-88x66.jpeg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/E-Pop-of-Culture-Logo-2013.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27610379&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/E-Pop-of-Culture-Logo-2013-88x66.jpg"], "top_img": "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/E-Pop-of-Culture-Logo-2013.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/platinum-life-music-docuseries-premiere-e-october/", "title": "The Platinum Life: Music Docuseries to Premiere on E!
