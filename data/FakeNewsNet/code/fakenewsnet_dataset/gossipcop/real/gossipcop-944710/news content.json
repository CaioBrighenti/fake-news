Britney, who looked cute and casual in a red top, posed on the edge of a couch next to her sons,12-year-old Sean Preston and 11-year-old Jayden James.\n\nJamie Lynn was positioned at the other end, while her oldest daughter, Maddie, who turns 10 next week, held her baby sister, Ivey Joan. Bryan sat next to Britney, while his daughter, Sophia, sat on Sean's lap.\n\n\"\u2665\ufe0fFAMILY\u2665\ufe0f,\" Jamie Lynn captioned the shot, also tagging her husband, Jamie Watson, and her mom, Lynne Spears.\n\nIt seems the family reunion was in the works for a while, as Britney expressed her excitement over Jamie Lynn's bundle of joy in April.\n\n\"I could not be more excited to welcome baby Ivey to this world. Congrats to @jamielynnspears and the whole family - I love you all so much!!!\" she tweeted, just after Sean and Jayden visited Maddie at a basketball game.\n\nIt's been a great year for Maddie, who recovered from a terrifying ATV accident in 2017.
