First sighting.\u201d\n\nShe also advised, \u201cDon\u2019t look without glasses!\u201d\n\nAs totality occurred, Parker filmed from the boat, showing glimpses of the sky. She gushed excitedly in the clip: \u201cOh my God, this is the most spectacular light I have ever seen. It doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening! You guys, it\u2019s happening!\u201d she squealed. \u201cOh my God! There\u2019s the corona. Oh my God there it is, there it is. It\u2019s happening and lightening and birds that are rarely ever seen! Oh my God!\u201d\n\nShe continued to sweep her camera over the sky, telling her followers, \u201cI wish you all were here! Oh my God. This is the most spectacular, unimaginably perfect, beautiful, ridiculous.\u201d\n\nIn a second clip, Parker\u2019s husband Matthew Broderick could be seen standing by her side as she whispered, \u201cWe did it, we made it. Oh my God, we saw it \u2026 it\u2019s so humbling. It\u2019s so extraordinary.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s Riveting Breakdown of 10 Memorable \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 Looks \u2014 Including the Iconic Tutu\n\nParker and
