According to the husband of Jennifer Aniston, the actor can\u2019t help but be bothered by the media\u2019s portrayal of him in the magazines. One thing in particular he can\u2019t stand is the made-up lies about him and Jennifer.\n\nJennifer and Justin are often the targets of unwanted attention, and Justin can\u2019t help but feel turned off by his image in popular culture.\n\nIn a sit down with the publication, Mr. Porter, Theroux talked about the tabloids tendency to constantly represent him as an evil man week after week.\n\n?\u2026\u2764\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT\n\nTheroux, who plays a mentally ill man on The Leftovers, claims, \u201cThere\u2019s this slightly insane person running around on the covers of tabloids who is mentally ill, clearly.\u201d\n\nJustin isn\u2019t the only one to have a beef with the tabloids.\n\nAniston slams the press repeatedly for conjecture and flat-out made up falsehoods.\n\nIn fact, in 2016, she claimed the media was built on a foundation of lies during a piece for The Huffington Post.\n\nIn the article, she claimed women\u2019s portrayal in popular culture as symbols is not a pleasant one.\n\nAniston explained the objectification and scrutiny they\u2019re put under is both absurd as well as disturbing.\n\nThe actress continued to say everything about her livelihood has been shamed in some form or another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether it be her marital status, her status as a divorcee, her lack of a husband, and even her nipples. She asked the question: why are we, the public, only observing women and girls through this particular fashion? And while Jennifer has a good point, it\u2019s important to note that the media merely caters to the demand of its audience. Businesses give the people what they want. If you want to see a change, there has to be a genuine shift in the morals and values of society.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Jennifer-Aniston-Will-Love-Brad-Pitt-Until-She-Dies-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Jeff-and-Raegan-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Brooklyn-Daly-Kenya-Moore-Marc-300x245.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Samantha-Smith-Nipsey-Hussle-Real-Man-300x213.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Donald-Trump-Jr-and-Aubrey-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chiris-Pratt-Nashville-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/friends-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justin-And-Jennifer--e1503022674724.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Kelly-Rowland-300x219.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jeremy-Lindholm--700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jennifer-aniston-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Rasheeda-Frost-Pregnant-Kirk-After-Kannon-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justin-And-Jennifer--e1503022674724.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "Lynn Gintonio", "Ann Mose", "Gloria Meredith", "Annie Smith"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/justin-theroux-thinks-the-tabloids-depiction-of-him-make-it-seem-like-hes-mentally-ill-60198/", "title": "Justin Theroux Thinks The Tabloids Depiction Of Him Make It Seem Like He\u2019s \u201cMentally Ill\u201d", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "jennifer aniston, justin theroux,", "keywords": "celebrity news, jennifer aniston, justin theroux,", "description": "What has Justin Theroux been thinking about lately?
