{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan", "text": "Live with Kelly and Ryan (or simply Live) is an American syndicated morning talk show, hosted by Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest. Executive produced by Michael Gelman, the Live with... show formula has aired under various hosts since 1983 locally on WABC-TV in New York City and 1988 nationwide. As of 2016, it is produced by WABC.[1]\n\nWith roots in A.M. Los Angeles and A.M. New York, Live began as The Morning Show, hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey; the show rose to national prominence as Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, when Philbin was joined by Kathie Lee Gifford. That incarnation of the program ran for 12 years and continuing as Live with Regis and Kelly for another decade before Ripa, after hosting with guest co-hosts for nearly a year, was paired with former NFL star Michael Strahan. The franchise has had longstanding success and has won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show and Outstanding Talk Show Hosts.[2] On January 19, 2016, the show was renewed through the 2019\u201320 season. On February 12, 2016, a special episode focused on Ripa's 15 years as part of the program. On April 18, 2016, Strahan and ABC announced that he was leaving the show to join ABC's Good Morning America full-time. On May 1, 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would join Ripa as her new permanent co-host, succeeding Strahan.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nConcept [ edit ]\n\nExecutive producer Michael Gelman said in 1993, \"The real concept of the show, in a symbolic sense, is that they are husband and wife. They have their coffee mugs and they're chit-chatting about what's going on.\" That is the basis of the show's signature \"Host Chat\", an unscripted on-air conversation between the co-hosts that opens each show. Then, a home viewer is called to answer a trivia question about the show, with the opportunity to win a vacation. The show then continues with interviews with celebrity guests, musical performances, and other recurring segments, including regular features showcasing fashion, food, health, and lifestyle topics.[3]\n\nEven earlier, the husband and wife breakfast chat program was popular in old time radio, beginning with Ed and Pegeen Fitzgerald, and later Dick Kollmar and Dorothy Kilgallen and Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg. These shows were parodied by Woody Allen in his film Radio Days. These programs were popular locally in New York and Philbin would have heard them growing up.\n\nThe format of Live! has been emulated by other successful talk shows such as the British programmes Richard & Judy and Today with Des and Mel. However, it has also proven to be resilient against similarly-formatted talk shows from other syndicators or networks, seeing programs such as Mike and Maty, George & Alana, Caryl & Marilyn: Real Friends, Donny & Marie, Living It Up! With Ali & Jack, The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet, and Anderson Live all launch and end in short periods of time throughout its entire run, and fail to make any headway in the traditional 9 a.m. local time slot Live! has been traditionally slotted in for most markets.\n\nThe show is broadcast live from New York City, on weekdays at 9 a.m. for stations in the Eastern Time Zone, and is tape-delayed for the rest of the country. Although the program is generally associated with the ABC network and airs on all ABC owned-and-operated stations, in many markets the program is syndicated to stations affiliated with other networks.[4] Live did not air in a morning timeslot on all ABC-owned stations until September 2013, as WLS-TV in Chicago programmed the 9 a.m. timeslot with The Oprah Winfrey Show (WLS-TV was the originating station for the program in the 1980s), then Windy City Live after Oprah concluded its run in 2011. Although WLS-TV had carried the New York-based Live in an overnight timeslot earlier in its run, the show aired on other Chicago stations, including WGN-TV from 2002 through 2013.[5][6]\n\nRecurring segments [ edit ]\n\nGuinness World Record Breaker Week, New York Auto Show Week, Broadway Week, and Top Teacher Week are examples of features frequently visited on the show, highlighting a different aspect of the theme everyday that week. Live will also invite \"whiz kids\" to oppose the co-hosts at spelling, athletics, mathematics, sport stacking, and technology, among other tasks. A recurring gag with Philbin as co-host was him challenging seniors\u2014preferably over the age of 100\u2014at tennis, basketball, ping-pong, and bowling, for example. Also, regular contributors to the show include toy enthusiast Chris Byrne, style maven Lawrence Zarian, animal expert Peter Gros, automotive expert Alan Taylor, pediatrician Greg Yapalater, home and gardening show host Katie Brown, technology specialist Leo Laporte, entrepreneur Carley Roney, Science Bob, veterinarian Jennifer Jellison, and nutrition expert Wendy Bazilian.[7]\n\nSpecials [ edit ]\n\nThe show has hosted a number of specials over the years since it began. Specials have included a Halloween celebration in which the co-hosts wore dozens of costumes and portrayed some of the most famous and infamous names in pop culture.[8]\n\nIn February, Live has thrown a wedding for a couple who wrote in with reasons why they should be married on the show.[9] Viewer submissions have also been accepted for their \"Moms Dream Come True Special,\" where the co-hosts pay tribute to a select group of mothers.[10] The show has aired a Post-Oscar Special the day after the awards ceremony live from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.[11]\n\nOn location [ edit ]\n\nLive has been to eight countries and nearly 25 states, logging 200,000 miles (320,000 km).[12] The list of remotes includes: Tampa, Hawaii, Monaco, Banff, San Antonio, Aspen, Walt Disney World, New Orleans, Disneyland, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Paris, Detroit, Chicago, The Bronx, Los Angeles, the USS Intrepid, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, Maui, Prince Edward Island, London, Scottsdale, the White House, Charlotte, Churchill Downs, Niagara Falls, Puerto Rico, Marina del Rey, Philadelphia, Branson, Mount Rushmore, The Bahamas, and the Dolby Theatre's set for the 85th Academy Awards. While on location, the co-hosts transplant the franchise's own brand of entertainment-oriented talk with the beauty of the particular location providing a colorful backdrop to the show's segments.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nCo-host timeline [ edit ]\n\nCo-host Seasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Regis Philbin Kathie Lee Gifford Kelly Ripa Michael Strahan Ryan Seacrest\n\n1971\u201381: A.M. Los Angeles [ edit ]\n\nThe show has part of its origins in A.M. Los Angeles, a local show that was broadcast on KABC-TV in Los Angeles from 1971 to 1981 that was originally created and hosted by Ralph Story, with Stephanie Edwards as co-host.[13] When the format went national as AM America in 1975 (taking Edwards along with it), Regis Philbin assumed hosting duties of the Los Angeles version, with Sarah Purcell as his original co-host. Purcell departed the show in 1978 and was replaced by Cyndy Garvey. Philbin and Garvey hosted A.M. Los Angeles until 1981.\n\n1970\u201383: A.M. New York, The Stanley Siegel Show, Good Morning New York [ edit ]\n\nMeanwhile, there were also two different morning-show predecessors on WABC-TV in New York City. The first was A.M. New York which debuted on May 18, 1970 as a local answer to NBC's Today show,[14] and was originally hosted by John Bartholomew Tucker. After he left in 1972, a succession of hosts came and went, until Stanley Siegel took over in late 1975. Under Siegel's stint, the show went from last to first in the ratings for a brief period, and from 1977 until his departure in 1978 it was known as The Stanley Siegel Show.[15] Following Siegel's departure for rival WCBS-TV, the show reverted to the A.M. New York name until its cancellation in 1980, by which point it had been hosted by Janet Langhart and Clay Cole. A few weeks later, WABC tried again with Good Morning New York, hosted originally by Spencer Christian and Andrea Kirby; Kirby would eventually be replaced by Judy Licht, and Christian was followed by the likes of Dick Wolfsie and longtime Eyewitness News reporter and anchor Doug Johnson. Like its predecessor for much of its run, Good Morning New York failed to make a dent in the ratings against Donahue on WNBC, and was cancelled in early 1983, with The Morning Show as its replacement.[16]\n\n1983\u201388: The Morning Show [ edit ]\n\nThe Morning Show, co-hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey, premiered locally on WABC-TV in New York on April 4, 1983. In 1984, Garvey left the show and Philbin hired Ann Abernathy, whom he remembered from his time at KABC-Television for her engaging personality, to assume the co-host duties.[17] After Abernathy got married and decided to return to Los Angeles, Kathie Lee Johnson (later Gifford) joined Philbin officially on June 24, 1985. Their chemistry proved to be successful as The Morning Show soon became number 1 in the market[18] and went on to debut in national syndication on September 5, 1988, when the title was changed to Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.\n\n1988\u20132000: Live with Regis and Kathie Lee [ edit ]\n\nEarly on, Live matched its local success with impressive national ratings and established itself as a dominant fixture in American television.[19] Entertainment Weekly described Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford as \"an agreeable mismatch\" and their famous banter as \"playful, edgy, and amusing.\"[20] Gifford's positivity throughout public scandals such as the 1996 accusation that her clothing line was being run under sweatshop conditions and her husband Frank Gifford's 1997 affair with a flight attendant resonated with the female demographic of the show, but ultimately made her a media target prompting her emotional departure on July 28, 2000. \"Over a third of my life has been [at Live],\" she said. \"This is family. It is been an amazing journey.\"[17] Gifford appeared on Live! with Regis and Kelly on three occasions, for the show's 20th Anniversary special on September 14, 2007, to promote her book Just When I Thought I'd Dropped My Last Egg: Life and Other Calamities on April 14, 2009, and again as a guest to bid farewell to Philbin on his second to last show, November 17, 2011. Gifford went on to host the fourth hour of Today with Hoda Kotb; that show mainly airs an hour after Live! in most markets, though a few markets where both shows air at 10:00 a.m. against each other do exist.\n\n2000\u20132001: Live with Regis [ edit ]\n\nWhen looking for Gifford's replacement, Philbin and executive producer Michael Gelman teamed Philbin with a handful of potential co-hosts, including Joy Philbin, Kathleen Murphy, Rosie O'Donnell, Jann Carl, Whoopi Goldberg, Kathy Fountain, Gloria Estefan, Jillian Reynolds, Lisa Rinna, Caroline Rhea and Suzanne Sena. This met with positive fan response and a 26 percent ratings increase.[21] Philbin won his first Daytime Emmy Award for Live during the six-month period, which he would go on to win twice with co-host Kelly Ripa. Ripa had auditioned four months into the search, on November 1, 2000.[22] Ripa was announced as the official replacement on February 5, 2001.[citation needed]\n\n2001\u201311: Live! with Regis and Kelly [ edit ]\n\nLive! with Regis and Kelly logo from 2009 to 2011 logo from 2009 to 2011\n\nLive! with Regis and Kelly's young-audience demographics increased by 80 percent, with Ripa credited[by whom?] for bringing \"a new life to the show.\" Seven months into Philbin and Ripa's run, the September 11 attacks on New York occurred, with coverage beginning twelve minutes before that day's episode would have started. The show was pre-empted for a week following the attacks and returned September 18, 2001.\n\nShortly after celebrating his and Ripa's 10th anniversary together, Philbin announced on January 18, 2011 that he would leave Live!.[23] The show then held a \"Regis Farewell Celebration Season\", showcasing Philbin's top moments from his 28 years on the program.[24] His final show aired November 18, 2011.[25]\n\n2011\u201312: Live! with Kelly (first era) [ edit ]\n\nLive! with Kelly logo from 2011 to 2012 logo from 2011 to 2012\n\nAfter Philbin's departure, the show was renamed Live! with Kelly. Joining Ripa were various co-hosts from broadcasting and entertainment. On November 21, 2011, Jerry Seinfeld was the first of 60[26] men and women to join Ripa at the co-host desk, including: Reggie Bush, Kyle MacLachlan, Russell Brand, Howie Mandel, Carl Edwards, Chris Harrison, Daniel Radcliffe, Michael Buckley, Michael Catherwood, Rob Lowe, Martin Short, Neil Patrick Harris, Peter Facinelli, Boomer Esiason, Ben Mulroney, Dan Abrams, Rob Thomas, David Duchovny, Pat Kiernan, Derek Hough, D.

The former New York Giants defensive end had begun his TV career on Fox NFL Sunday, a job he said he would keep even though it shoots in Los Angeles. The Ripa-Strahan chemistry proved to be successful. Live With Kelly & Michael had been the No. 2 syndicated talk show averaging a 2.8 national rating over Strahan's entire tenure while Live With Regis & Kelly averaged a 2.6. Live With Kelly & Michael brought in 268,000 more audience members daily, on average, than the show attracted during the end of the Regis run.[30] On January 19, 2016, the show was renewed through at least the 2019\u20132020 season.[31]\n\nOn April 19, 2016, it was announced that Strahan would leave Live to join Good Morning America full-time.[32] The decision was revealed to the program's production staff just after that day's broadcast of Live, and officially announced on the program by Strahan the following day. Ripa, however, was absent from that day's episode, and ABC announced later in the day that Live would have guest co-hosts through April 25, 2016. Although speculated to have been a reaction to Strahan's abrupt exit, an ABC staff member stated to Variety that Ripa's sudden absence was a \"pre-scheduled vacation\".[33]\n\nRipa returned on April 26, 2016, using the opening of the episode to address the reception to Strahan's exit, and ABC's continued commitment to Live as a series.[34] Strahan's final episode on Live occurred on May 13, 2016 and featured several flashback moments from the four years that he co-hosted the show.\n\n2016\u201317: Live with Kelly (second era) [ edit ]\n\nLive with Kelly logo from 2016 to 2017 logo from 2016 to 2017\n\nOn Monday, May 16, 2016, Ripa began the second era of her Live career as a single co-host. Jimmy Kimmel joined her as her first guest co-host.\n\n2017\u2013present: Live with Kelly and Ryan [ edit ]\n\nLogo from May through September 2017\n\nOn May 1, 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would succeed Strahan as the new permanent co-host, after a year long syndicated co-host search. Seacrest will also join as an executive producer to the show.[35][36]\n\nOn September 5, 2017, Live with Kelly and Ryan updated the show's look with a new, modern logo, modifications to the studio, and a brand new show opener.\n\nOn May 1, 2018, Ripa and Seacrest celebrated their first anniversary with a look back at the best moments of the past year.\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nThe New York Daily News gave the program a positive review, \" \u2026 When it comes to the amount and playfulness of morning talk, nothing beats Live\".[37] In 2001, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016 the show won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Hosts and in its 24th year, after twenty-one nominations, it won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show. In addition, its co-hosts have received two TV Guide Award nominations for Favorite Daytime Talk Show and multiple People's Choice nominations for Favorite Talk Show Host.\n\nAccording to daytime television ratings, viewership averages 5 million per episode,[38] ranking number 1 in all big markets, such as New York City, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, Miami, West Palm Beach, and many others. Dominating its time periods, Live is the top-rated morning show and regularly the #1 syndicated talk show.[39]\n\nInternational broadcast [ edit ]\n\nCountry Television Network(s) Weekly schedule (local time) Period Canada CTV Monday\u2013Friday 9:00 am ET/PT 10:00 MT/AT 10:30 NT\n\nsimsubs of United States stations 1988\u2013present", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Blue_pencil.svg/10px-Blue_pencil.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_Sept_2017.svg/1200px-Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_Sept_2017.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/LIVE%21_with_Kelly_logo.png/220px-LIVE%21_with_Kelly_logo.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_Sept_2017.svg/250px-Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_Sept_2017.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Live_with_Kelly_onscreen_logo.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg/23px-Flag_of_Canada_%28Pantone%29.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Wikinews-logo.svg/40px-Wikinews-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_2017.png/220px-Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_2017.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7f/Live-logo.png/220px-Live-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_Sept_2017.svg/1200px-Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_Sept_2017.svg.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan", "title": "Live with Kelly and Ryan", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.34.0-wmf.13", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_Sept_2017.svg/1200px-Live_with_Kelly_and_Ryan_logo_Sept_2017.svg.png"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
