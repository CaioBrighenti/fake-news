Kardashian West wore a custom chainmail Versace dress featuring crosses embroidered on the bodice and hip, in tribute to the night\u2019s theme of \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.\u201d\n\nPerry, 33, went with a very literal interpretation of the theme, donning gigantic angel wings with a gold metallic mini dress with chain long sleeves and matching over-the-knee boots.\n\nImage zoom Kim Kardashian Amy Sussman/WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nImage zoom Katy Perry Andrew H.
