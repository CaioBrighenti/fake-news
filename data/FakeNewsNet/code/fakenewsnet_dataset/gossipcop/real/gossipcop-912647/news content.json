Nobody has to be pissed off on my behalf. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nPolanski was arrested in 1977 for five offenses following the alleged assault, including rape by use of drugs, perversion, sodomy, and lewd and lascivious acts upon a child under 14. He fled the country after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor.\n\nTarantino has been engulfed in controversy in recent days. In a New York Times article, Uma Thurman said the director pressured her to perform a dangerous car stunt during the shooting of \u201cKill Bill\u201d that led to an injury to the actress. The \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d director has also been highly scrutinized over his professional relationship with Harvey Weinstein, the indie mogul who has been accused of assault and rape by dozens of women. The director acknowledged that he knew that his ex-girlfriend Mira Sorvino was assaulted by Weinstein, but continued to make movies for the producer for decades.\n\n\u201cI knew enough to do more than I did,\u201d Tarantino told the New York Times in October shortly after reports of Weinstein\u2019s abuse and harassment broke. \u201cThere was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip. It wasn\u2019t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things. I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard. If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.\u201d\n\nTarantino has a number of high-profile films in the works that could be derailed by the backlash. He\u2019s directing Leonardo DiCaprio in a drama sat against the backdrop of the Charles Manson murders and is developing a \u201cStar Trek\u201d movie for Paramount. The Manson film is being backed by Sony Pictures. Manson\u2019s followers murdered Polanski\u2019s wife Sharon Tate in 1969.\n\nHere\u2019s Tarantino\u2019s full statement, first reported by Indiewire:\n\nI want to publicly apologize to Samantha Geimer for my cavalier remarks on \u201cThe Howard Stern Show\u201d speculating about her and the crime that was committed against her. Fifteen years later, I realize how wrong I was. Ms. Geimer WAS raped by Roman Polanski. When Howard brought up Polanski, I incorrectly played devil\u2019s advocate in the debate for the sake of being provocative. I didn\u2019t take Ms. Geimer\u2019s feelings into consideration and for that I am truly sorry.\n\nSo, Ms. Geimer, I was ignorant, and insensitive, and above all, incorrect.\n\nI am sorry Samantha.\n\nQuentin Tarantino", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/rexfeatures_10330533ap.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1",
