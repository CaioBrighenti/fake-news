It has been confirmed that the rapper\u2019s Hollywood Hills home that served as a bachelor pad back in the day has been sold.\n\nIt has been quite a long journey for the husband of Kim Kardashian as he has been trying to sell the pad since 2010.\n\nThe mansion received an offer of $2.95 million, and the sale was done privately. Los Angeles Times first reported the real estate news.\n\nIn case you are wondering if that is a great deal or not, you should be aware of the fact that Kanye bought the three-bedroom, four-bathroom property back in 2003 for $1.7 million.\n\nRegarding what the new owners will experience once they move in, amenities include a breakfast room, home theater, a fish tank in the master bedroom and a cartoon-like mural in the dining room.\n\nLots of things have changed for Kanye since he purchased the mansion more than 10 years ago.\n\nKidchella #Norths1stBirthday A post shared by Yeezus.
