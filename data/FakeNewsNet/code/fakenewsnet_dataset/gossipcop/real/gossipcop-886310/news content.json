In a post on Joanna\u2019s Magnolia Market blog, the couple explained that saying goodbye is \u201cbittersweet\u201d but the best decision for their family.\n\n\u201cWhile we are confident that this is the right choice for us, it has for sure not been an easy one to come to terms with,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOur family has grown up alongside yours, and we have felt you rooting us on from the other side of the screen. How bittersweet to say goodbye to the very thing that introduced us all in the first place.\u201d\n\nCongratulations to Chip, Joanna, HGTV and the whole Highnoon Productions team on a historic run with Fixer Upper. Read the show announcement and see the complete video at magnoliamarket.com/blog. #season5iscoming A post shared by Magnolia (@magnolia) on Sep 26, 2017 at 8:05am PDT\n\nUnhappy with the pair\u2019s family-first explanation, the media immediately began to speculate about the \u201creal\u201d reason\u2014from marital problems to a desire for a bigger contract\u2014behind the seemingly sudden announcement, but in this week\u2019s People magazine cover story, the Gaines candidly open up about the toll their meteoric business growth and nonstop filming schedule has taken on them and their children as they explain how they made peace with their decision to walk away.\n\nUltimately, through their faith and commitment to family, the Gaines seem to have realized something that few others in the entertainment industry do: sometimes it is best to walk away when you\u2019re on top.\n\nIn the article, the couple shares that since Fixer Upper debuted in 2013, they have been filming 11 months of the year, while also managing their 500-employee strong company, Magnolia, which includes a real estate division, retail store, wallpaper and furniture lines, a quarterly magazine, luxury vacation rentals, books, an upcoming restaurant and a product line for Target.\n\n\u201cNobody told us that that was unique,\u201d Chip told the magazine of the production schedule. \u201cNobody told us that that was a little bit irrational.\u201d\n\nWith their children getting older, they realized the pace was unsustainable.\n\n\u201cThe kids were so young when we started,\u201d Joanna said. \u201cFast-forward to today and our oldest is almost a teenager \u2014 they\u2019re all growing up so quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would ask, \u2018Mom and Dad, do you guys have to film again today? When is this going to be over?\u201d Chip added.\n\nUltimately, through their faith and commitment to family, the Gaines seem to have realized something that few others in the entertainment industry do: sometimes it is best to walk away when you\u2019re on top.\n\n\u201cWe would rather stop here, where we still feel we\u2019re in a really good place,\u201d Chip explained. \u201cWe have the chance to regroup and refresh and find out in two years, thank God we stopped and gave each other time and energy and loved our family more\u2026 Hopefully that will pay dividends down the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe really want to focus on this break and take a step back to let this all soak in,\u201d Joanna concluded. \u201cRegardless of what the future holds, we are hopeful for what God has for us and our family in this next season.\u201d\n\n(H/T: People)", "images": ["https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/twitter.png", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/searchIcon.jpg", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/phone.png", "https://d2unjtbcxaijk4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/06221214/Animated-Logo.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1245377632165567&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/shortLogo.png", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/email.png", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/play_circle.png", "https://d2unjtbcxaijk4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13102454/Chip-and-Joanna-Gaines-e1507915571961.jpg", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/pinterest.png", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/staticLogo.png", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/facebook.png", "https://www.lightworkers.com/wp-content/themes/lightworkers/images/menuTriangle.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=25599611&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://d2unjtbcxaijk4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13102454/Chip-and-Joanna-Gaines-e1507915571961.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.lightworkers.com/hopeful-god-us-chip-joanna-gaines-open-theyre-leaving-hit-show/", "title": "Chip & Joanna Gaines Open up About Why They\u2019re Leaving Their Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "p": {"domain_verify": "a996bae350c94ef2905747cd8c82a19f"}, "description": "Chip and Joanna Gaines explained that saying goodbye to their role on Fixer Upper is \u201cbittersweet.\" Get the whole story at LightWorkers.com now.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chip & Joanna Gaines Open up About Why They\u2019re Leaving Their Show", "description": "Chip and Joanna Gaines explained that saying goodbye to their role on Fixer Upper is \u201cbittersweet.\" Get the whole story at LightWorkers.com now.", "url": "https://www.lightworkers.com/hopeful-god-us-chip-joanna-gaines-open-theyre-leaving-hit-show/", "site_name": "LightWorkers", "updated_time": "2018-02-15T20:47:42+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://d2unjtbcxaijk4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13102454/Chip-and-Joanna-Gaines-e1507915571961.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d2unjtbcxaijk4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13102454/Chip-and-Joanna-Gaines-e1507915571961.jpg", "width": 1021, "height": 576}}, "article": {"tag": "Parenting", "section": "uplift", "published_time": "2017-10-12T22:53:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-15T20:47:42+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1055970457939699}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Chip and Joanna Gaines explained that saying goodbye to their role on Fixer Upper is \u201cbittersweet.\" Get the whole story at LightWorkers.com now.", "title": "Chip & Joanna Gaines Open up About Why They\u2019re Leaving Their Show", "image": "https://d2unjtbcxaijk4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13102454/Chip-and-Joanna-Gaines-e1507915571961.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://d2unjtbcxaijk4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/01181412/cropped-Favicon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507848837.0, "source": "https://www.lightworkers.com", "summary": ""}
