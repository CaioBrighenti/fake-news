The couple said their vows in front of 300 guests, including family and friends who flew in from the United States, Canada, Latin America and Scotland.\n\n\u201cWe are still floating on clouds\u2026 today couldn\u2019t have been more magical,\u201d the couple exclusively tells PEOPLE. \u201cSurrounded by so many loved ones in such a beautiful place was unreal. We are very, very lucky. Friends, family, amazing food, blue skies and being even more in love than ever before \u2014 what more could we ask for?\u201d\n\nDesigned by Oany Ravelo, the destination wedding festivities kicked off on May 9 with bachelor and bachelorette excursions including a bicycle tour and cooking classes. They then hosted an Apulian style welcome party on May 11, complete with artisan booths including cheese and pasta making.\n\nImage zoom Dennys iLic\n\n\u201cThere was never a thought of doing anything else for both of us,\u201d says Scott. \u201cA whole week to hang out on a beach, enjoy each others\u2019 company: that sounded like the perfect wedding to us.\u201d\n\nFor more details and photos from the wedding, pick up the issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday, May 18, and watch PeopleTV\u2019s exclusive special, People Weddings: Drew Scott and Linda Phan, on Wednesday, May 16 on PeopleTV.com or download the app on your favorite mobile or connected device.\n\nFor the big day, Phan\u2019s ceremony and reception dresses were designed by Claire Pettibone, while Scott, 40, and his groomsmen wore kilts by Claymore Imports. Scott later changed into a custom tuxedo for the reception by GotStyle.\n\nThe couple exchanged custom wedding bands by Devil\u2019s Workshop and Florist Vincenzo Dascanio created the flower arrangements for the ceremony. \u201cHe\u2019s a mastermind,\u201d says Phan, 31, of the arrangements.\n\nFor their first dance, the newlyweds surprised guests with a choreographed number by Scott\u2019s Dancing with the Stars partner, Emma Slater, and her husband, Sasha Farber.\n\nThe wedding party included Scott\u2019s brothers, Jonathan and J.D., who served as the best men, while Linda opted to go sans maid of honor, but had 10 bridesmaids. Scott gifted his groomsmen with personalized gift sets by Swanky Badger and Linda gave her wedding party PJ sets and scarves by Cloroom and Wayu Shigra Bucket Bags from ME to WE, hand-woven by artisan partners in Ecuador.\n\nIn lieu of a registry, the couple partnered with the non-profit ME to WE to tie their wedding with their passion for the charity\u2019s mission to provide access to clean water to people in need around the world.\n\nFor each of their 300 guests, Scott and Phan gave out two travel bags designed by Lug, plus custom pizza cutters and plates that they created with Fortessa, the manufacturer of their Scott Living line. The set will also be available for purchase on Amazon, and for each one sold, Fortessa will donate to the #WeMovement, providing one person with clean water for life.\n\nThe couple\u2019s buttercream frosting cake, which will be featured on an episode of Cake Hunters (airing June 25, at 8:30 p.m. on Food Network), was made with four flavors inside including vanilla with goat cheese and strawberry balsamic, organic red velvet, carrot and chocolate hazelnut.\n\nWhile the pair is keeping their honeymoon destination a secret, they can\u2019t wait for the next chapter of their lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most looking forward to spending more time together,\u201d says Scott. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working so hard for so long, I\u2019m looking forward to making plans to settle down and just enjoy doing nothing once in a while.\u201d\n\nProperty Brothers: Linda & Drew Say I Do premieres June 2 at 9/8c on TLC.", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/brady-bunch-house-tout.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C800px%2C420px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/amazon-devices-sale-tout-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tout.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/hgtv-smart-home-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tout-image.jpeg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1300px%2C682.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mdl2.jpg?crop=289px%2C49px%2C1592px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sheets-amazon.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/siblings-yara-sayeed-and-ehsan-shahidi-family-photo.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/roomba-tout.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/01/editorial-franchise-exclusive.png", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/drew-linda-wedding1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/disney-world-star-wars2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mariolopez_hgtv_supersizemypool.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1269px%2C666.225px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/american-airlines.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/celebs-in-italy-3.jpg?crop=0px%2C706px%2C2164px%2C1136px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/tout-1-14.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/jonathan-scott.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/sale-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/buffy-comforter-sale-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/friends-pottery-barn.jpg?crop=0px%2C195px%2C2689px%2C1413px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/property-brothers-forever-home-jd.jpg?crop=164px%2C21px%2C1029px%2C540px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/drew-linda-wedding1.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/abf9db2653ecb4f32659c769e636133d?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/net-chairs-tout.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/drew-linda-wedding1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Strohm"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/home/drew-scott-linda-phan-wedding/", "title": "Drew Scott Is Married!
