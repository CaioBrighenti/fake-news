Ellen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi shared last week that they had evacuated their six pets from their home near Santa Barbara, while former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Adrienne Maloof announced her family\u2019s evacuation on Twitter.\n\nChelsea Handler, Lionel Richie, Paris Hilton and Lea Michele also had to leave their homes for safer ground.\n\nImage zoom Thomas Fire David McNew/Getty Images\n\nThe massive Thomas Fire covered at least 267,500 acres as of Saturday evening, according to CNN, making it the third-largest wildfire in California\u2019s history. The 2003 Cedar Fire was the largest, which burned 273,246 acres in San Diego County.\n\nFirefighters have fought strong winds to contain 40 percent of the blaze. Forecasters predict winds should ease late Sunday night, allowing for additional containment, the outlet reports.\n\nCollectively, the blazes cover an area larger than New York City and Boston combined, CNN reports. Officials also announced at a news conference that more than 1,000 structures have been destroyed.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Man Rescues Rabbit From California Wildfire\n\nTwo deaths have been linked to the recent fires in southern California. On Dec. 5 a 70-year-old woman was found dead and it is believed she crashed while trying to evacuate the Thomas Fire.\n\nCory Iverson, a 32-year-old fire-engine strike team member of Cal Fire\u2019s San Diego unit, was killed as he fought a blaze near Ventura County on Thursday. Iverson\u2019s wife Ashley is currently pregnant with their second child. The couple also has a 2-year-old daughter, Evie. A GoFundMe page has been created by Ashley\u2019s friend to help with expenses following the tragedy.", "images":
