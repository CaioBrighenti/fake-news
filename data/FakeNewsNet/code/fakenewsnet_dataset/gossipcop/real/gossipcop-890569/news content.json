So big, in fact, we might even say they go Biggie. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z dressed up as Lil\u2019 Kim and Notorious BIG for pal Kelly Rowland\u2019s Halloween party, and we are so obsessed with these two paying homage to their fellow hip-hop legends.\n\nThe Carters always slay when it comes to their costume choices (remember when Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z dressed as Barbie and Ken last year?) and this year, it seems they\u2019re following in Kim Kardashian\u2019s footsteps by dressing up as music icons with their incredible Biggie and Lil\u2019 Kim costumes, and you have to see these looks.\n\nfalse\n\nThere were plenty of iconic Kim looks for Bey to choose from, but she went with her white blouse, red leather pants, and Chanel suspenders from Missy Elliott\u2019s \u201cThe Rain\u201d music video. In true \u201990s fashion, Beyonc\u00e9 rocked dark lipliner, black shades, and Kim\u2019s signature beauty mark above her upper lip.\n\nJay managed to coordinate perfectly with his other half, donning a Biggie-inspired red leather jacket, a white tee, jeans, and Biggie\u2019s signature cane.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has yet to post any photos of their couples\u2019 costume on social media, but we\u2019re sure she will soon, and we cannot wait.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Kelly\u2019s Couture Costume Party was held in West Hollywood. The parents to new twins partied with fellow famous pals like Usher, Jermaine Dupri, and A$AP Rocky, and it looks like the crew had an amazing time.\n\nNo word on what Blue Ivy and the twins will be dressed as, but we know for sure it\u2019ll be epic.", "images": ["https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091645/best-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/28093147/kim-kanye.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/06115728/priyanka-chopra-nick-jonas1.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/05101729/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-e1559755074843.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/03082137/katy-perry-engagement.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/18140611/cardi-offset-rolling-loud.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/21113237/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072538/avatar-f-150x150.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/31001848/bey-jay.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/30111333/lili-reinhart-cole-sprouse-e1559240023885.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/19124505/katie-and-jamie-e1545252318997.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/27073438/picture-of-nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-tribute-photo.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/25090612/kristen-bell-dax-shepard.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/05/20084935/picture-of-sophie-turner-joe-jonas-photo.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/01110356/rose-leslie-kit-harington.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/05114407/elisabeth-moss.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/14110433/meghan-trainor-marry-me-e1550171116146.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/06/06075314/beyonce.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/12155159/best-friend-stories.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/04/22091648/bestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/01/02094443/khloe-tristan.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/12/07092413/kim-kardashian-kanye-west.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/21094239/schumer-husband.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/03/15101152/cole-lili.png", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2019/02/06093214/teigen-first-date.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/31001848/bey-jay.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arielle Tschinkel"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/beyonce-jay-z-halloween-lil-kim-notorious-big/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z dressed up as '90s hip-hop icons for Halloween", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Beyonc\u00e9,Beyonc\u00e9 Halloween costume,Jay-Z", "news_keywords": "Beyonc\u00e9,Beyonc\u00e9 Halloween costume,Jay-Z", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z channeled two of hip hop's biggest legends ever for Halloween this year.", "og": {"title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z dressed up as '90s hip-hop icons for Halloween", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/beyonce-jay-z-halloween-lil-kim-notorious-big/", "description": "They always basically win Halloween.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/31001848/bey-jay.jpg", "width": 3456, "height": 5184}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/beyonce-jay-z-halloween-lil-kim-notorious-big/", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z channeled two of hip hop's biggest legends ever for Halloween this year.", "media": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/31001848/bey-jay.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/celebrity-couples/beyonce-jay-z-halloween-lil-kim-notorious-big/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z dressed up as '90s hip-hop icons for Halloween", "description": "They always basically win Halloween.", "image": "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/10/31001848/bey-jay.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
