Here are a few makeup tricks that'll make you look extra adorable in that jersey but in a very girl-next-door, born-with-it way.\n\n1. Even out your skin tone using BB cream or tinted moisturizer instead of doing full foundation, for an illusion of makeup-free flawlessness. Then go back in with concealer only where needed, like on your undereye circles and blemishes (makeup artists often apply concealer afterward like this because it prevents them from using more than necessary).\n\n2. Dial down the eyeliner. Black can look too harsh for a Sunday afternoon; try brown or a soft neutral color instead, working the color down into your lashes so it defines your eyes without calling attention to itself. Consider just dipping an eyeliner brush into eyeshadow and using that as your liner, for an extra-natural effect.\n\n3. Blush it up. Nothing says \"cute girl next door\" more than healthy rosy cheeks, and let's face it, reapplying lip gloss or lipstick is going to be a losing battle once the guacamole bowl comes out (and what, are you gonna daintily sip that Coors Light through a straw?). Might as well put your color pop on your cheeks.\n\nWhat are your favorite girl-next-door makeup moves?
