Reddit user Crow_Rufio_Crow recently posted a lash selfie on Reddit's Makeup Addiction forum with one eye with naked lashes and one eye wearing the $5 drugstore mascara \u2014 with unbelievably dramatic results. Seriously, it looks like she's got lash extensions on. She wrote, \"Been waiting for what seems like forever to open my new tube of mascara. Finally jumped on the Essence lash princess train and HOLY SHIT.\"\n\nReddit: Crow_Rufio_Crow\n\nYeah, I'd say.\n\nLast we wrote about this mascara about a year ago, another Reddit user had also posted her dramatic before and after shot of using this mascara with equally impressive results. For just $5 it's only a matter of time before this mascara climbs the ranks of Holy Grail status for beauty aficionados.\n\nJust so you don't get it twisted, there are few variations of the Essence Lash Princess mascara, and Crow_Rufio_Crow makes note that this one she used is in the peachy pink tube \u2014 the Lash Princess Volume Mascara. There's also the Lash Princess Sculpted Volume Mascara in a purple tube, and the Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara in the green tube.\n\nUser BeachWhy says, \"The BEST ONE! I've tried the other two as well, they're not as good\" and Crow_Rufio_Crow responds \"Yes! I loved the false lash, green tube , but this just blows it out of the water.\"\n\nSo there you have it \u2014 if you're going to eenie-meenie-minie-mo this one, go for the peach. Then again, they're all $5 so, it's not like you couldn't just easily build a mascara wardrobe of all three.\n\nThis post originally appeared on October 9, 2017:\n\nFinding a good mascara, is easier said than done \u2014 you have to kiss a few metaphorical mascara frogs before you find a volume-boosting and lengthening mascara Prince Charming, if you will. But one Redditor may have just found the crown princess of all mascaras \u2014 and it\u2019s under $5.\n\nRedditor EllieDaisyLouise took to the Makeup Addiction thread \u2014 site of so many royally good beauty discoveries \u2014 to share a truly unbelievable mascara find you can scoop up at the drugstore: Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/59d55a8490c697202ac78cd8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/mascare_embed.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d1baf376e41980008cd4044/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Essence%2520Lash.png", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03ccf0f1007cddbcfdcdb0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/poli.png", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b730501c30bc42fbc79367d/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/Essence-Lash-Princess-Volume-Mascara.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03c0adf1007c2917fdcdac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-baby-phat-forever-21.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d02741cec86fe22b708f421/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/space-nk-new.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d0bdd396a1e4e293f8ab561/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/leann%2520rimes.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d07a421ab0933024a53a537/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/selma-blair-haircut.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59bff6946330ad166ceea954/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Essence%252520Lash%252520Princess.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b73034639bed6699a01280e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Essence-Lash-Princess-MAscara-before-and-after-.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59bfe12b6bff9b38cde8da59/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/essence%252520lashes.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a739a69884a2f2616591b22/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/face-wash_lede.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b72fc40c30bc42fbc793679/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Reddit%252520Crow_Rufio_Crow%252520Essence%252520Lash%252520Princess%252520MAscara.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d1ac9b1f420e300081a19d3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/dior-haute-couture-fall-winter-2019-2020.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b73034639bed6699a01280e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Essence-Lash-Princess-MAscara-before-and-after-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Leah Prinzivalli", "Kristen Bateman", "Maddie Aberman", "Sophie Wirt", "Marci Robin", "Macaela Mackenzi", "Asia Milia Ware", "Kaleigh Fasanella", "Zachary Zane"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/really-good-drugstore-mascara-essence-cosmetics", "title": "Essence $5 Drugstore Mascara Is Better Than More Expensive Options", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "One Redditor discovered the ultimate drugstore mascara that delivers results worthy of royalty \u2014 or a mascara ad.", "keywords": "drugstore makeup,essence,mascara,cheap makeup,reddit beauty", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "No, these are NOT falsies.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b73034639bed6699a01280e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Essence-Lash-Princess-MAscara-before-and-after-.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Holy Shit, a $5 Mascara Did This to Someone's Lashes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/really-good-drugstore-mascara-essence-cosmetics"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "No, these are NOT falsies.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b73034639bed6699a01280e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Essence-Lash-Princess-MAscara-before-and-after-.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Holy Shit, a $5 Mascara Did This to Someone's Lashes"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606, "admins": "648235154,789168297,688620285"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
