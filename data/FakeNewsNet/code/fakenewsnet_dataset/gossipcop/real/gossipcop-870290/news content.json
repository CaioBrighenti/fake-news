A four-year relationship, two-year engagement ended by a simple text message. Just like that,\u201d Edwards, 24, wrote in a leaked excerpt from the group\u2019s latest book One World, confirmed as legitimate by PEOPLE.\n\nMalik addressed the rumor, telling The Fader magazine that he has too much respect for Edwards \u201cthan to end anything over text message.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Disney/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Perrie Edwards Says Zayn Malik Ended Their Engagement with a \u2018Simple Text\u2019\n\nImage zoom Pascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\nThe singer and Hadid first started dating in late 2015, and have been inseparable ever since. Recently, the duo graced the cover of Vogue\u2018s August issue together.\n\nDuring an interview with the Evening Standard, Malik explained that it\u2019s nice having a partner who can relate to having a high-profile career, but it\u2019s by no means the main reason his relationship with Hadid works.\n\n\u201cOh yes, definitely \u2014 she gets it, she\u2019s very understanding,\u201d he said of her knowledge of the fame game. \u201cBut I can understand how it can look, that you\u2019ve got these two people in a \u2018power couple.\u2019 That\u2019s not something I want to be a part of. I\u2019m with her because I like her and I hope she\u2019s with me because she likes me. When we come home, we don\u2019t really talk about that s\u2014. We just spend time together as a normal couple, cook food, watch TV, have a laugh.\u201d", "images": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/zayn-gigi-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gigi-hadid7.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gigi-hadid12.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/bella-thorne-10.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gigi-hadid12.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/paul-mccartney-4.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/iheart-radio-moments-4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/channing-tatum-jessie-j-3.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/yolanda-hadid-1.jpg?crop=90px%2C131px%2C901px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/taylor-swift-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/elm080119wlmiley0001.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/lisa-rinna-yolanda-foster.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/whenharrymetsally2-e1562700407502.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hope-solo-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/jessica-alba-cash-warren-paris-vacation.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/tyra-banks-rihanna.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/john-delaney.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/zayn-malik.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1024px%2C537.6px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/guy-fieri.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/116ab788de5f8b786cd3e7aa9ed6e0c3?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/mackenzie-edwards.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1300px%2C683px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/ramona.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1280px%2C672px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/couple-1.jpg?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/anwar-dua.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/62132869_2418834228361596_4728333127554951814_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C369px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-1096270896.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/dua-lipa-anwar-hadid-1-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rex_1d_zayn_perrie_file_1893527g.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/spencer-pratt-stephanie-pratt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/screen-shot-2019-04-25-at-8.41.31-am.png?fit=250%2C250", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/mickey-pretzels-1-2000.jpg?&fit=250%2C250"], "top_img": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gigi-hadid12.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/perrie-edwards-diss-gigi-hadid-sings-hope-she-aint-faking-it-like-hadid/", "title": "Did Zayn Malik's Ex Perrie Edwards Diss Gigi?
