On July 18th, Grande took to Instagram to debut her latest hair transformation. She\u2019s now sporting pastel lavender locks and good god (is a woman), it looks amazing on her.\n\nGrande toyed with pastels in her most recent music video for her single, \u201cGod Is A Woman.\u201d Inspired by the purples, whites, and blues of the galaxy, Grande incorporated those colors into the video\u2019s set and costuming (or lack thereof \u2014 she donned pastel body paint, courtesy of artist Alexa Meade).\n\nBut after the shoot wrapped, Grande clearly wasn\u2019t ready to say goodbye to those pastel hues just yet. Freelance hairstylist behind her painted \u201cGod Is A Woman\u201d locks, Josh Liu, helped Grande make a more permanent shift into pastels. He instagrammed the look, captioning it \u201cLavender dreams.\u201d\n\nWhen we say we have Grande hairstyle whiplash, it\u2019s because just days before her purple transformation, Grande went silver/cotton candy-blue for a Reebok campaign. And before that, she was seemingly back to her natural brown after trying platinum blonde on for size in April.\n\nEven though we\u2019re having a hard time catching our breath between dye jobs, we must admit that Grande is absolutely slaying the hair game lately.\n\nOf course, now that Ariana Grande has pastel lavender hair, we want pastel lavender hair.\n\nPastel hair colors have been trendy for a few years now, but we\u2019re not nearly over them yet. Just scrolling through the #pastelhair tag on Instagram is giving us serious unicorn/fairy/magical hair envy.\n\nLavender certainly suits the candy-sweet pop goddess, but we know it won\u2019t last for long. So let\u2019s savor this new Grande \u2018do before she\u2019s onto the next \u2014 although, we\u2019re pretty excited to see whatever that next color is.", "images": ["https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/share-icons/assets/share-pinterest-icon.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/share-icons/assets/share-facebook-icon.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/recommended-reads/recommended-reads-icon.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/assets/icon-yt.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/assets/icon-fb.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/assets/icon-ig.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ariana.jpg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/assets/close.svg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/header/assets/logo.svg", "https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/header/assets/search_icon.svg", "https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ariana.jpg", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/share-icons/assets/share-email-icon.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1856301868018746&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy-child/icon.png", "https://4fnrju1lpo0p5xh6d3ugm1pv-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/soyummy/partials/share-icons/assets/share-twitter-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://itsblossom.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ariana.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bailey Benningfield", "Karen Belz", "Deirdre Durkan", "Mary Sauer"], "canonical_link": "https://itsblossom.com/ariana-grande-dyed-hair-color-transformation/", "title": "Ariana Grande Dyed Her Hair, And This Is Our Favorite Color Transformation Yet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ariana Grande is rocking yet another new 'do and we're totally obsessed.
