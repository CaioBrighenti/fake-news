Chris Jackson / Getty\n\nThe average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (\u00a323,700).\n\nFive figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich \u2014 and especially if you're royalty rich.\n\nNext month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.\n\nKensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.\n\nThe case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding\u2014 the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (\u00a323.7 million).\n\nMarkle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (\u00a332 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.\n\nThe venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel \u2014 and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place \u2014 is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.\n\nThe greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (\u00a330 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.\n\nOtherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.\n\nBelow, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.", "images": ["https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5acfd2cd146e7129008b47c8-750-562.jpg", "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ad911071b60b42c008b49c0-1136-568.jpg"], "top_img": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ad911071b60b42c008b49c0-1136-568.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/royal-wedding-cost-meghan-markle-prince-harry-2018-4", "title": "Cost of the royal wedding for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ii-ab-test": {"hpi4": "variant"}, "msapplication-config": "//media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#1d607c", "date": "2018-05-16", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-16", "news_keywords": "Royal Wedding, Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Cost of Wedding, Features, Royal Family, Arts & Culture, Royal Wedding 2018, Wedding Cost, Tanza Loudenback", "sailthru.tags": "Royal Wedding, Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Cost of Wedding, Features, Royal Family, Arts & Culture, Royal Wedding 2018, Wedding Cost, Tanza Loudenback", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's royal wedding will cost $2.8 million \u2014 plus $43 million in security costs.
