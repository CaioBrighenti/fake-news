Though it's unclear how they identified, Gill's obituary stated that they preferred to be called \"Mr. Gill\" and speculated that they had undergone sex reassignment surgery.\n\nTrans actresses Trace Lysette (Transparent) and Jamie Clayton (Sense8, The Neon Demon) protested Johansson's casting, arguing that trans actors have enough trouble getting work in Hollywood and should not be deprived of the opportunity to play a rare character of their identity.\n\nThe video, produced by the queer digital magazine INTO, parodies Johansson's casting by envisioning a situation where a transgender man (Schofield) is offered one of Johansson's roles but turns it down because \"cis women are actually really marginalized in Hollywood, you know?\"\n\nSchofield adds, \"I know that there are people who have lived this experience and would bring a lot of authenticity to it, and I feel a little weird taking that from them. Thank you so much for the opportunity and no thanks.\"\n\nIn a comment attributed to Johansson via her representative that was sent to the digital magazine Bustle in early July, she replied to her critics, \"Tell them they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman\u2019s reps for comment.\u201d The Hollywood Reporter could not confirm the comment.\n\nWatch the video below.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/07/trans_men_audition_for_scarlett_johansson_roles_-_screengrab_-_h_2018.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2018/07/trans_men_audition_for_scarlett_johansson_roles_-_screengrab_-_h_2018.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1562102990/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?a0259e7bd063a50286c0", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2017/12/heashot_thumb_0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/07/trans_men_audition_for_scarlett_johansson_roles_-_screengrab_-_h_2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Kilkenny", "Katherine.Kilkenny Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trans-men-audition-old-scarlett-johansson-roles-parody-video-1126172", "title": "Trans Men Audition for Old Scarlett Johansson Roles in Parody Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "In a video published Friday, transgender men D'Lo, Justin Chow, Scott Turner Schofield and Rocco Kayiatos (who goes by the stage name Katastrophe) try out for cisgender parts Scarlett Johansson has played.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trans-men-audition-old-scarlett-johansson-roles-parody-video-1126172", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Trans Men Audition for Old Scarlett Johansson Roles in Parody Video", "description": "Performers including D'Lo and Scott Turner Schofield try out for Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in 'The Avengers' films and Samantha in 'Her.'", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/07/trans_men_audition_for_scarlett_johansson_roles_-_screengrab_-_h_2018.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Trans Men Audition for Old Scarlett Johansson Roles in Parody Video", "description": "Performers including D'Lo and Scott Turner Schofield try out for Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in 'The Avengers' films and Samantha in 'Her.'", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trans-men-audition-old-scarlett-johansson-roles-parody-video-1126172", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/07/trans_men_audition_for_scarlett_johansson_roles_-_screengrab_-_h_2018.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Trans Men Audition for Old Scarlett Johansson Roles in Parody Video", "sailthru.description": "Performers including D'Lo and Scott Turner Schofield try out for Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in 'The Avengers' films and Samantha in 'Her.'", "sailthru.author": "Katie Kilkenny", "sailthru.vertical": "Movies", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-10 17:11:29", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Scarlett Johansson"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531257089.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
