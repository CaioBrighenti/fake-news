Turns out, not enough. (Shocker.) According to dermatologists and makeup artists, we should be sudsing up our tools on a weekly basis \u2014 at least \u2014 in order to prevent bacteria buildup, which can ultimately led to unwanted breakouts. Read on to find out how to clean up your makeup brushes the right way.\n\nFirst of all, how often should you clean your makeup brushes?\n\nMost dermatologists will tell you to soak your tools, especially foundation and concealer brushes, once a week \u2014 at minimum \u2014 to prevent product buildup. Because these brushes are used on your face, the cleaner, the better, says Bobbi Brown. \"Brushes that are used around the eyes should be cleaned at least twice a month,\" she says. \"All others can be washed once a month.\"\n\nAccording to makeup artist Ashleigh Ciucci, soaping up your makeup brushes regularly can extend the life of the bristles and make for a better makeup application. \"Brush hairs and sponges are porous, so they hold onto oils, debris, and bacteria,\" she says. \"If your brushes are dirty, your application will be spotty and blending will be difficult.\"\n\nWhat should you use to clean your makeup brushes?\n\nThe best (and most thorough) method for cleaning your tools requires only water and either a gentle soap (regular soap formulas can dry out the brush's bristles, especially if they are made of natural hair) or brush cleanser. (Easy, peasy.)\n\nHow do you actually clean the brushes?\n\nFollow these seven steps for cleaner, good-as-new brushes and blenders.\n\nWet the bristles with lukewarm water. Place a drop of makeup brush cleanser or soap into the palm of your hand. Gently massage the tips of the bristles in your palm. Rinse the bristles. Squeeze out the excess moisture with a clean towel. Reshape the brush head. Let the brush dry with its bristles hanging off the edge of a counter, thereby allowing it to dry in the correct shape. Never let your brushes dry on a towel \u2014 the bristles can become mildewed.\n\nMid-wash, keep the base of the brush head away from soap and water. The bristles are glued to the base, and water and detergent can cause the glue to disintegrate and the bristles to come loose and shed. Do not dry vertically \u2014 this will cause water to leak into the ferrule [the piece that joins the bristles to the wand], which will also loosen the glue and lead to bristle loss.\n\nDo you recommend any makeup brush cleaning products?\n\nTwo products stand out: the 2X Sigma Spa Brush Cleaning Glove and Vera Mona Color Switch.\n\nVera Mona Color Switch", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5771a5da2554df47220a682d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/beauty-trends-blogs-daily-beauty-reporter-brush-cleaner.gif", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d02741cec86fe22b708f421/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/space-nk-new.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03c0adf1007c2917fdcdac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-baby-phat-forever-21.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/57719fab2554df47220a5f1f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/beauty-trends-blogs-daily-beauty-reporter-glove.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5935f5ae1ff0147762b9a3db/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/How%252520to%252520Clean%252520Makeup%252520Brushes.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d07a421ab0933024a53a537/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/selma-blair-haircut.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5d03ccf0f1007cddbcfdcdb0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/poli.png", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5935f5ae1ff0147762b9a3db/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/How%2520to%2520Clean%2520Makeup%2520Brushes.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5935f5ae1ff0147762b9a3db/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/How%2520to%2520Clean%2520Makeup%2520Brushes.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Asia Milia Ware", "Kaleigh Fasanella", "Zachary Zane", "Kate Sulliva", "Kristi Kellog", "Stephanie Saltzma"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/how-clean-are-your-makeup-brus", "title": "How to Clean Your Makeup Brushes (and How Often You Should Do It)", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "Makeup artists and dermatologists answer all our questions about makeup brush cleansing.
