Naturally, \u201cChapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart\u201d is a comedown from that. It\u2019s not as big, it\u2019s not as opulent; the event-of-the-week is dead body disposal. That\u2019s not to say the show no longer looks special, because it always does. But this week, it looks notably different for another reason: The Vampire Diaries creator Julie Plec directed the episode. In the world of The CW, that\u2019s quite the get. It\u2019s also morbidly appropriate, considering all the blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to the title card, the Cooper scenes even look like they could fit perfectly into an episode of Vampire Diaries, with or without the blood. Going from typical Riverdale dark blue tint (which we were originally left with at the end of \u201cChapter Twenty-Five\u201d) to the bright gold is like a sudden crash back to reality. At least, Riverdale\u2019s version of \u201creality.\u201d Riverdale loves to keep things like this in the dark, except for here, where the bloody scene is as bright as it possibly can be. But it\u2019s the shot where Betty lays her head down to sleep and it goes from night to day that most owes itself to Plec\u2019s past work, as there is nothing less Riverdale\u2014yet so very Vampire Diaries\u2014than Betty waking up, greeted by rays of sunshine through her window. It\u2019s the most sun there\u2019s ever been on this show, and it\u2019s a devilishly cheeky choice, due to what happened the night before.\n\n\n\nThis episode features the best version of Betty we\u2019ve seen in a long time. It also serves as a reminder of Betty\u2019s strength that made her the clear hero of this series: her need to get things done, even in the worst circumstances. While it seems like a bad idea at first, taking the shady man\u2019s phone leads to her finding out Chic called him in the first place. She\u2019s finally starting to see him for the manipulator he is, and the only thing preventing her from getting to the bottom of Chic is Alice. To quote \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d: \u201cThe disease had sharpened my senses\u2014not destroyed\u2014not dulled them.\u201d Only, in Betty\u2019s case, she hasn\u2019t actually gone mad.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, this is getting dangerously close to me suggesting trauma makes Betty sharper, which is almost as bad of a take as Riverdale\u2019s entire approach to mental illness. Even though she gets stuff done here, Betty\u2019s far from 100%. Don\u2019t forget the bizarre moment of her wiping down every individual apple for possible fingerprints\u2026 right after Alice tells her the shady man didn\u2019t touch them at all. (Also, of the two lines Chic has this episode, neither of mention what his dealer\u2019s name was. So we\u2019re stuck with \u201cThe Shady Man.\u201d) She\u2019s also flashing back to the bloody murder scene almost every waking moment. The good news is, she asks Jughead for help. So many things happening on this show right now could be solved if these characters just asked each other for help.\n\n\n\nThis is all follow-up to Jughead and Betty having sex for the first time, and in all the stress, Betty basically forgets it happened until Jughead brings it up. But that\u2019s only the first in a long line of actual communication between these two in this episode! That sounds normal, but this entire season has proven that\u2019s apparently a novel concept. \u201cChapter Twenty-Six\u201d is a good episode for this plot\u2019s core four\u2014Reinhart, Sprouse, Amick, and Ulrich\u2014who all give compelling performances and have something substantial to work with. The code of silence between these four has a weight to it that is severely lacking in the plot that actually mentions the very concept. Jughead is still in crusader mode here, but it\u2019s at a bearable level, especially since he has a leg to stand on for once and figures out the Lodge/McCoy land conspiracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadelaine Petsch is again given very little to do as Cheryl, but since her small parts intersect with this plot, it\u2019s worth noting that she makes a lot out of the little she has. Would that she could threaten a disappointing Riverdale parent every episode. She even has the line of the episode:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re destroying families with your courtesan ways.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the rest of the episode, which works hard not to work at all, on multiple levels. From the smallest moments to the biggest picture, all the absurd enjoyment that last week\u2019s love letter to cinematic organized crime provided is nonexistent here. Instead, all that\u2019s left are questionable choices (from characters, the story itself) and even more questionable characterizations. While there\u2019s obviously great suspense in the A-plot, the Archie/Veronica/Lodge stuff exists and fails based on quite the opposite.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor example, take the simple concept of Archie\u2019s soundproof garage. With this episode, it\u2019s suddenly no longer soundproof\u2026 because there needs to be something to spook Alice and Betty even more, while also possibly waking Fred Andrews up and ruining Archie\u2019s weird thing with Agent Adams. Keep in mind, the entire point of the garage scenes between Archie and Adams was so no one would ever know about their meetings, because it\u2019s soundproof. So because of a supposed plot need, it becomes the setting of the series\u2019 worst attempt at creating suspense. Then, the episode doubles down on trying to make Adams seem scary\u2014which was impossible after last week\u2019s \u201ccrime family\u201d line\u2014by cranking up the pressure. How does it do that? Well, it adds a brand new quality to the character: He\u2019s a hat guy. Now he wears a hat that\u2019s conspicuous by nature, to meetings where he\u2019s attempting to be inconspicuous. That\u2019s weird, right? But it\u2019s necessary for the absolute shock when Archie comes home and see Adams\u2019 hat. It\u2019s a \u201csuspenseful\u201d moment that couldn\u2019t have existed before, because the writers didn\u2019t think to give Adams any distinguishing characteristic until this episode. Kind of like how they almost didn\u2019t think to introduce Mr. Svenson until right before they revealed he was the Black Hood.\n\n\n\nAt one point in this episode, Archie tells Hiram Lodge that he \u201clikes\u201d him. What is there for Archie to like about Hiram, especially after the past two episodes? Archie knows for a fact he\u2019s a criminal on a major scale, because even Veronica confirmed it. So at first, when Archie says he can\u2019t think of anyone who could be a \u201ccapo\u201d for Hiram (despite Andre\u2019s existence), one can chalk it up to him not putting two and two together. But as the episode progresses, it\u2019s clear from scene-to-scene that Archie genuinely believes Hiram isn\u2019t the monster he\u2019s made out to be. Even though he is. This episode doesn\u2019t for once suggest that Archie is only thinking with his heart and pledging loyalty to Hiram to protect Veronica either. Speaking of, even Veronica doesn\u2019t buy her own father\u2019s alleged innocence. In fact, even though Archie tells Hiram that Veronica is spiraling over the possibility that he had Papa Poutine killed, she seems pretty put together when she fire back a lie of her own (mirroring Hiram\u2019s lie) right to Hiram\u2019s face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo is Archie just a terrible judge of character? With the exception of her tipping Mayor McCoy off about a possible scandal\u2014no doubt to prove to the audience she hasn\u2019t fully gone \u201cDark Veronica\u201d or whatever they\u2019ll call her\u2014Veronica\u2019s only issues with her family\u2019s methods are that fragile Archie might get hurt. Veronica is 100% on-board with and complicit in her parents\u2019 villainy otherwise. In this episode alone, Veronica\u2019s reaction to her father being responsible for the statue head isn\u2019t anger that Hiram intentionally fanned the flames of Riverdale\u2019s class war and worked to evict Southside families; it\u2019s to try to \u201cmanage\u201d Jughead as a result of that. Basically, Veronica\u2019s attempts at peace between the Northsiders and the Southsiders are even hollower than they appeared. Then again, Veronica doesn\u2019t care that her father tries to blackmail one of her \u201cfriends\u201d right in front of her, just like Archie doesn\u2019t care that his \u201cbest friend\u201d is at risk of losing his home because of the man he \u201clikes.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the Lodges suddenly being mafiosos, Andre the driver/security guard/doorman now only says \u201cboss\u201d when he\u2019s talking about his employer. Because Riverdale is a glorious live-action cartoon. Also, it wants the surprise reveal to really land when it happens. Early in this episode, I found myself thinking how disappointing it is that Hiram\u2019s increased role as the villain has essentially pushed Hermione into the background in comparison. Hiram\u2019s the one who has the heart-to-hearts with Veronica; Hiram\u2019s the one who has meetings to broker peace; everyone tries to woo or take down Hiram. Even when Hermione has scenes with Veronica, Hiram is usually also part of them. So the reveal that \u201cthe boss\u201d is Hermione works to put the pair back on equal footing, with Hermione possibly being even higher. However, as the Lodges get more intimidating, it only becomes that much more unbelievable that they\u2019re putting so much trust into Archie. That they trust him with their omert\u00e0, their code of silence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLess surprising and more believable, however\u2014as pretty much everyone who comments here guessed\u2014is the reveal that Agent Adams isn\u2019t an FBI agent at all and was instead a test from the Lodges. It\u2019s a disappointment that he didn\u2019t end up being a massive hallucination on Archie\u2019s end\u2026 but considering how many reviews/recaps I saw that treated this reveal like it was a genuine surprise, perhaps most Riverdale viewers just aren\u2019t ready to crank it up to that next level.\n\n\n\n\u201cChapter Twenty-Six\u201d is an episode that relies heavily on illogical behavior and unearned tension, without at least bringing along the fun that \u201cChapter Twenty-Five\u201d did in the process. You know something\u2019s wrong when the plot that makes the most sense is the one where the Cooper women cover up a murder. In fact, that plot is exceptional and the highlight of this episode, despite it all spawning from Chic. And while the Lodges are good villains, they\u2019re anchored by a weak character like Archie, a devolving character like Veronica, and the simple fact the Riverdale has worked hard this season to make the audience want to root for anyone Jughead is against.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lodges and their reach are also in nearly every part of the show at the moment, with the Coopers and Blossoms currently existing as the only characters not affected by them. Which is why the Cooper family plot (and Blossom family mini-plot) still doesn\u2019t save this episode\u2014it\u2019s a small life raft in comparison.\n\nStray observations\n\nRiverdale Roulette: 10 Things I Hate About You. There is literally only one archery scene in this film, but since Cheryl is an archer now\u2014as there is literally one archery scene in this episode\u2014that\u2019s enough. Also, I can imagine any Blossom or Lodge (all rich criminals sound alike) saying \u201cThat must be Nigel with the brie.\u201d\n\n10 Things I Hate About You.

This week, Josie\u2019s role as the saddest character continues in the form of her standing behind her mother as she steps down as mayor. Sad. And plot facilitator Kevin Keller strikes again, as he gleefully informs the gang of the latest dead body. Those are literally the only scenes either character is in.\n\nIn this new segment, I\u2019ll address Josie and Kevin\u2019s contributions to an episode.

And plot facilitator Kevin Keller strikes again, as he gleefully informs the gang of the latest dead body. Those are literally the only scenes either character is in. Fun fact about Thistlehouse: It is the original Salvatore boarding house from The Vampire Diaries\u2019 pilot.\n\nBetty: \u201cIt was self-defense, right?\u201d\n\nAlice: \u201cYes, of course it was. But it won\u2019t matter.\u201d If it truly was self-defense, then why wouldn\u2019t it matter? Besides the fact that Sheriff Keller is not great at his job.\n\nAlice: \u201cYes, of course it was. But it won\u2019t matter.\u201d If it truly was self-defense, then why wouldn\u2019t it matter? Besides the fact that Sheriff Keller is not great at his job. I\u2019m surprised FP doesn\u2019t blow a gasket when he learns Jughead sent the statue head to the Lodges. But I\u2019m even more surprised he doesn\u2019t lose it when Jughead says \u201cno deal\u201d to Hiram. Because while Jughead can write an expos\u00e9 that takes down Hiram Lodge, he and Betty are currently suspended from The Blue & Gold\u2014Riverdale\u2019s only respectable newspaper\u2014because of his last expos\u00e9.\n\nFor 98% of his screentime in this episode, Chic says nothing, and that\u2019s great. Hart Denton does a really good job with Chic\u2019s facial expressions, no matter how fake they tend to be. But his worst parts are when he has to recite any of the character\u2019s lines.\n\nPenelope Blossom has fallen in love with Hal Cooper. She\u2019s bad at this prostitute thing.\n\nArchie: \u201cAgent Adams\u2014you stay the hell away from my dad.\u201d Nothing has ever sounded less intimidating.\n\nThe parking attendant vehicle strolling into frame is one of the funniest moments of the episode, despite it happening in such a stressful scene. I don\u2019t even think it was intended as a sight gag, but it works as the type of humor where you\u2019ve reached your breaking point, are running on no sleep, then all of a sudden one more thing comes along.\n\nFP (to Alice): \u201cWe take care of our own.\u201d When FP recites Serpent law, it\u2019s charming. By the way, despite no one caring to notice, FP\u2019s obviously still deeply affected by what he did to Jason Blossom.\n\nWhile it\u2019s touching to see Alice be grateful for FP\u2019s help, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is the worst thing she has ever done to Betty. Not just forcing her to lie but the way she tries to make Betty continue on like everything is normal.\n\nThe twisted humor of Chic and Alice playing Clue won\u2019t go unnoticed though.\n\nWhen did Riverdale get a large bluff overlooking crashing waves?", "images": ["https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=5zq9nmk&ct=0:ngtk7da&fmt=3", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--xkaAD0S---/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/lqhqj6nqdmipb7wwexeq.jpg", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--z8iYuFG1--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/hweureqa4x6yqsvvaaeq.jpg", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/activity;dc_iu=/4246/DFP_Audience_Pixel;dc_seg=22540930;blog=avclub;ord=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6770184&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--BwWvo_oP--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/hweureqa4x6yqsvvaaeq.jpg", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--c8V3jI7s--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_264,q_80,w_470/nw2amf8mrt7aynwkhqwy.jpg", "https://x.kinja-static.com/assets/images/logos/placeholders/avclub-saturated.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--BwWvo_oP--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/hweureqa4x6yqsvvaaeq.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Latoya Ferguson", "About The Author", "Contributor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.avclub.com/riverdale-s-the-tell-tale-heart-explores-the-code-of-1822832349", "title": "Riverdale\u2019s \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d explores the code of silence, to mixed results", "meta_data": {"dynamic-stylesheet": "//x.kinja-static.com/assets/stylesheets/editor-edd40da2ae92de7cb0979025edd33027.css", "google-site-verification": "P13oAn8o8LB6FVCJWKsHWXvxfbR-SJrmvox6EgULpUs", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--MI9Nx2yt--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Ha40b6eI--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "keywords": "Riverdale, Recap, The A.V.
