As seen in the clip below, Kris picks up the phone in the middle of a meeting with Kim Kardashian West. \"Is it urgent?\" she asks, to which Kendall can be heard responding, \"It's an emergency.\"\n\nOn the phone, Kris immediately makes sure Kendall has taken care of her basic needs and asks if she's physically okay. \"Have you eaten something?\" she asks. \"Do you want me to come take you to the hospital? Okay, I'm going to come get you. Where are you?\" Kendall replies that she's really close to Caitlyn Jenner's house, so Kris promises her she'll come get her in 15 minutes before hanging up to let Kendall talk to Caitlyn.\n\n\"She doesn't feel well,\" Kris tells Kim, when she asks what's going on. \"She's not quite sure what it is.\" Kris then tells viewers in an interview that Kendall's anxiety might be getting triggered by her busy schedule. \"Kendall has anxiety, and I think she has so much going on that she gets herself really worked up,\" she says. \"Kendall gets the most anxious during Fashion Week, so when she's traveling a lot and Milan's coming up and trying to juggle it all, [it's] overwhelming.\"\n\nIn the clip, footage from an older episode shows Kendall FaceTiming her mom in the middle of a panic attack and saying she wants to get off a plane. \"It's so weird because I get like super light-headed when I'm on planes, too, and I feel like I'm going to faint,\" she says in another older clip. \"Everyone says I'm fine, but I don't feel fine.\"\n\nKendall has shared before that her panic attacks often take place on planes, and last month, she told Harper's Bazaar that she has \"such debilitating anxiety\" that it sometimes wakes her up at night. She deals with it all by engaging in healthy coping mechanisms; in 2017, she revealed that she does breathing exercises and tries to distract herself when she feels an attack coming on.\n\n\"[I] learned that it's all mental, so I try to prevent anxiety attacks by bringing my mind somewhere else,\" she previously wrote on her app, according to Harper's Bazaar.\n\nIf you experience panic and/or anxiety attacks like Kendall, it's important to know that you're not alone. As Teen Vogue previously reported, Kendall's coping mechanisms are effective ways to deal with panic attacks. Therapist Gary Brown told Teen Vogue that once you have your breathing under control, you can try talking to yourself before lying down to order your body to calm down. \"Understand that panic attacks can happen to anybody. You are a normal person, having a normal reaction to an accumulation of stress and anxiety in your life,\" he said.\n\nRelated: Kendall Jenner Opens Up About Struggling With Anxiety", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d14bbf94b98130009ffd32e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Acne%2520Awards_Kendall%2520Jenner_Story.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a858f28c98c2d46de010853/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kendall-jenner-calls-kris-anxiety-attack-social-lead.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d13aa5921ce3d00092405af/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/TeenVogue_Bullying-crywolf%2520(6).jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d1cbb7136d64100080403b6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-white-tanks.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d176b9f7f0d93000861f058/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-hero-kylie-jenner.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a858f29c06208469d9170c8/16:9/w_1280%2Cc_limit/kendall-jenner-calls-kris-anxiety-attack-web-lead.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d0d0708e244761aac7f9d92/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Celeb%2520Roundup%2520-%25206.21_Story.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d0a4689834a3dbe8e695953/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/00-story-gina-rodriguez.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5d18e0af07cbea0008a9632e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1151534534.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a858f28c98c2d46de010853/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kendall-jenner-calls-kris-anxiety-attack-social-lead.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Sara Radin", "Tatum Dooley", "Bianca Nieves", "De Elizabeth", "Emily Wan", "Bianca Betancourt", "Sofia Barrett-Ibarria", "Tess Garcia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kendall-jenner-calls-kris-jenner-anxiety-attack", "title": "Kendall Jenner Calls Her Mom During an Anxiety Attack in a New &quot;Keeping Up With the Kardashians&quot; Clip", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2019", "description": "In an upcoming episode of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" Kendall Jenner calls her mother in the midst of an anxiety attack.", "keywords": "snd,kendall jenner,kris jenner,anxiety,keeping up with the kardashians", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"description": "You are not alone.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a858f28c98c2d46de010853/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kendall-jenner-calls-kris-anxiety-attack-social-lead.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Kendall Jenner Is Showing Her Anxiety Attack on Television", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kendall-jenner-calls-kris-jenner-anxiety-attack"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "You are not alone.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a858f28c98c2d46de010853/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kendall-jenner-calls-kris-anxiety-attack-social-lead.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Kendall Jenner Is Showing Her Anxiety Attack on Television"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311, "admins": 108943}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4zzoEd4M038"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
