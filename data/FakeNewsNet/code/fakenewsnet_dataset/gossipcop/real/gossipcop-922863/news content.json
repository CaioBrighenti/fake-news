She was 49.\n\nThe actress died after 12 p.m. on Friday at the Franciscan St. James Health Olympia Fields hospital just outside of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reported. Brown\u2019s cause of death was not immediately disclosed.\n\nOn Chicago Fire, Brown played the witty and pragmatic Connie, the assistant to Chief Boden, and appeared on the show since it began in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Chicago Fire\u2019 family is devastated to lose one of its own,\u201d Dick Wolf, the show\u2019s executive producer, said in a statement. \u201cOur thoughts and prayers are with DuShon\u2019s family and we will all miss her.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

When auditioning for the role, she said, she realized the \u201cone-liner\u201d role could develop into something more. The character then became more complex and served as sort of a mother figure, Brown said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done this beautiful dance with Connie where you see her soft moments, you see how she cares about the kids in the firehouse,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown had a similar experience during her 13-episode stint on AMC\u2019s Prison Break, where her character, initially just called \u201cNurse,\u201d developed into a larger role, later named Katie Welch. She appeared on that show from 2005 to 2007.\n\nThroughout her career, Brown also appeared in a number of other TV shows and films, including Shameless and Empire. When not in front of the camera, Brown worked as a crisis counselor at Kenwood Academy High School in Chicago and led its drama program, according to the Tribune.\n\nGrowing up, Brown attended Whitney Young Magnet High School in Chicago and graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a degree in psychology. She is survived by her daughter, Zoe.\n\n\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of a very talented and kindhearted soul,\u201d Robert Shroeder, Brown\u2019s manager at Grossman & Jack Talent in Chicago told the Tribune. \u201cShe brought laughter and joy to many, and she will be greatly missed.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/dushon-monique-brown.jpg?quality=85&w=171&h=154&crop=1", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/dushon-monique-brown.jpg?quality=85&w=171&h=154&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Calfas"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5213931/dushon-brown-dead-chicago-fire/", "title": "\"Chicago Fire\" Actress DuShon Monique Brown Dies at Age 49", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "onetime,remembrances,Television", "news_keywords": "onetime,remembrances,Television", "description": "\"Chicago Fire\" actress DuShon Monique Brown, who played the fire chief's assistant Connie, died Friday.
