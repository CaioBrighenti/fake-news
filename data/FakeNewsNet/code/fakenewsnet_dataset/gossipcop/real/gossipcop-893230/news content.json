As you guys know, I'm a pretty strong and confident person but even I have a story to tell. \u2014 Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson) November 11, 2017\n\nWilson, 37, claimed that after meeting him in a room, he asked her \"repeatedly\" to perform a sex act.\n\n\"All whilst his male 'friends' tried to film the incident on their iPhones and laughed,\" she continued. \"I repeatedly said no and eventually got out of the room.\"\n\nBryan Bedder/Getty Images\n\n\"I called my agent immediately and my lawyer made a complaint with the studio \u2014 basically to protect myself that in the event something similar ever occurred I'd be able to walk out of the job and not obliged to return,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nI called my agent immediately and my lawyer made a complaint with the studio - basically to protect myself that in the event something similar ever occurred I'd be able to walk out of the job and not obliged to return. \u2014 Rebel Wilson (@RebelWilson) November 11, 2017\n\nWilson claimed she was then \"threatened by one of the star's representatives to be nice and support the male star.

I had the ability to escape both incidents. I realize not everyone is as lucky,\" she said.\n\nI feel lucky that I grew up in a pro-female environment, going to an all-girls high school, and that I have such a strong sense of self and have taken self-defense classes.
