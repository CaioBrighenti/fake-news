On the talk show, Julie Chen asked Smith if he ever asked Jeff Probst or the show\u2019s producers not air the segment that effectively outed him to the world. Smith\u2019s answer is transcribed in full below:\n\nI love Survivor and I was drawn to apply to Survivor because of the integrity in the storytelling. And when I first applied, I didn\u2019t tell casting that I was trans. That was developed later in our relationship. And I had a chat with Jeff Probst in which we agreed if, how, and when I\u2019m gonna talk about this part of my life\u2014it\u2019s gonna be up to me, as opposed to being outed by a fellow contestant being the exception. But in the aftermath of being outed, I\u2019ve been granted unprecedented autonomy in how I wanted to tell my story. We started having conversations all the way back in Fiji nine months ago about the care with which this episode was going to be handled. I came to Jeff and asked if I could write a personal essay about what happened and he immediately said yes. And I was really proud of how I responded. And I wanted the world to see how much I\u2019d grown and I also thought by showing what happened, maybe it wouldn\u2019t happen to someone else and something good could come of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo that\u2019s neither a yes or no, and in many ways brings up more questions, such how these conversations started all those months ago after the events that aired during the episode took place. Was it with CBS saying, \u201cWell, we\u2019re definitely airing this footage, so you can either work with us or...not\u201d? Now that both Varner and Smith have explained themselves, it seems that CBS should take some responsibility and do the same.", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--AKYFyuQY--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/rlech9u0t5d8mcjojhu1.jpg", "https://insight.adsrvr.org/track/evnt/?adv=5zq9nmk&ct=0:ngtk7da&fmt=3", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--SKCDRok---/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_77,pg_1,q_80,w_137/hzgja8aaw9ivhglndj4h.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6770184&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--uOnMehwe--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/rbufftbk6azitlxqxh8n.jpg", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/activity;dc_iu=/4246/DFP_Audience_Pixel;dc_seg=22540930;blog=jezebel;ord=1"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--uOnMehwe--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_900,q_80,w_1600/rbufftbk6azitlxqxh8n.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rich Juzwiak", "About The Author", "Some Pig.
