Meghan and her step-mother-in-law's relationship is described as \"aces,\" and filled with \"real warmth and support,\" which is lovely to hear.\n\nThe family friend also tells Vanity Fair that \"Camilla has been very helpful to Meghan,\" welcoming her into the royal family. And whenever the pair have been photographed together, it's clear that they definitely enjoy one other's company:\n\nChris Jackson Getty Images\n\nBy all accounts, according to Vanity Fair's profile, both Charles and Camilla were extremely supportive of Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan earlier this year. The publication spoke to someone who attended the May 2018 nuptials, who revealed that Charles \"seemed like the settling hand on the whole day,\" and Camilla apparently \"seemed like she had been doing this forever.\"\n\nOver the summer it was reported that Meghan and Harry had spent some time with Camilla and Charles at Castle of Mey in Caithness in Scotland, per Us Weekly. At the time, a source even told BAZAAR.com that, \"They stayed for five days and it was Prince Charles hosting them.\"\n\nBAZAAR\n\nFor more royals and can't-miss fashion and beauty news, sign up for the Harper's BAZAAR Newsletter.\n\nSUBSCRIBE", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-camilla-duchess-of-cornwall-news-photo-961403322-1541257432.jpg?crop=0.692xw:0.427xh;0.288xw,0.0571xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-harry-jacket-comp-1541104233.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-camilla-duchess-of-cornwall-news-photo-961403322-1541257432.jpg?crop=0.692xw:0.427xh;0.288xw,0.0571xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a24596383/meghan-markle-camilla-duchess-of-cornwall-friends/", "title": "Meghan Markle & Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Are Close, Supportive Friends", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Meghan Markle Gets on so Well with Her Stepmother-in-Law", "description": "Meghan gets on so well with her stepmother-in-law.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a24596383/meghan-markle-camilla-duchess-of-cornwall-friends/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-camilla-duchess-of-cornwall-news-photo-961403322-1541257432.jpg?crop=0.692xw:0.427xh;0.288xw,0.0571xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-11-05 03:13:49", "published_time": "2018-11-03 03:55:00", "section": "Celebrity News"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-camilla-duchess-of-cornwall-news-photo-961403322-1541257432.jpg?crop=0.692xw:0.427xh;0.288xw,0.0571xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Meghan Markle &  Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Are Close, Supportive Friends", "description": "Meghan Markle appears to have been getting on very well with her new in-laws.
