The band, who will be inducted into the 2018 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April, recently released the second leg of their latest album This House Is Not For Sale with two new singles titled \u201cWhen We Were Us\u201d and \u201cWalls.\u201d\n\nBut what\u2019s an album without a show? Bon Jovi is gearing up to head back out on a two-month tour starting March 14 in Denver, Colorado and ending in Washington, D.C. on May 14.\n\nImage zoom Bon Jovi Chelsea
