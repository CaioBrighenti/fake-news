Celebrities have taken on the call to raise awareness and donations in support of those impacted by the devastation.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony hosted the star studded One Voice: Somos Live disaster relief concert in honor of their beloved Puerto Rico. Demi Lovato, DJ Khaled, Ricky Martin, Gwen Stefani, Alex Rodriguez, Mary J. Blige and Jamie Foxx were among the celebs who hit the stage to raise funds for those affected by Hurricane Maria in PR.\n\nLopez, who has donated $1 million to hurricane relief efforts, took to the stage stressing the importance of coming together in the face of adversity. She also took a not so subtle dig at Donald Trump\u2019s recent visit to Puerto Rico. \u201cThere are some messes you can\u2019t clean up with paper towels,\u201d taunting the fact that Trump tossed rolls of paper towels at hurricane survivors.\n\nOne of the most recent updates from the relief benefit revealed that there had been over $20 million donated.\n\nKim Kardashian West, Ellen DeGeneres and Selena Gomez also took part in the fundraising efforts on behalf of the American Red Cross, Reach Out Worldwide, United Way, United for Puerto Rico and other charities.\n\nOther celebrities like Common, Ciara and Russell Wilson took to social media sharing their excitement for the event.\n\n#SomosUnaVoz: Much love to all the amazing artists taking part in this show to support our brothers + sisters in Puerto Rico! pic.twitter.com/ApuC9hBmag \u2014 COMMON (@common) October 15, 2017\n\nHey everyone! We\u2019re live at the telethon! Please call in and donate! \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 15, 2017\n\nIf you missed the show last night check out the video above to see all the amazing work celebs did to help our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico.", "images": ["http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:251842?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:668035?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:673814?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:251842?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=480&height=270", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:669222?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:246689?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=150&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:651374?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:677902?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110"], "top_img": "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:251842?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.vh1.com/news/330509/puerto-rico-relief-benefit-concert-somos-live/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and a Host of Stars Stand in Solidarity With Puerto Rico at the Somos Live!", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtvnservices.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "beacon_topic": "vh1.com"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:articles.vh1.com:330509"}, "og": {"site_name": "VH1 News", "title": "Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and a Host of Stars Stand in Solidarity With Puerto Rico at the Somos Live!", "url": "http://www.vh1.com/news/330509/puerto-rico-relief-benefit-concert-somos-live/", "image": {"identifier": "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:251842?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "Celebrities attend the Somos Una Voz disaster relief concert to help Puerto Rico."}, "fb": {"app_id": 709094809266522}, "twitter": {"description": "Celebrities attend the Somos Una Voz disaster relief concert to help Puerto Rico.", "title": "Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and a Host of Stars Stand in Solidarity With Puerto Rico at the Somos Live!", "image": "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:251842?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "url": "http://www.vh1.com/news/330509/puerto-rico-relief-benefit-concert-somos-live/", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Celebrities attend the Somos Una Voz disaster relief concert to help Puerto Rico.", "thumbnail": "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:vh1.com/news/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/JLOSOMOS-1508088807-300x198.jpg?quality=0.8&format=jpg"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/JY1ZCn2Ou-A?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vh1.com", "summary": ""}
