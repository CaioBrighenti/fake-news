Bobby Zarin acquired his wealth as the co-founder of Zarin Fabrics and Home Furnishings, New York's biggest discounted designer fabrics warehouse. The business has been in the Zarin family for several generations. The company is frequently used to provide materials for dozens of production sets, including \"Gossip Girl\", \"Lipstick Jungle\", \"Sex and the City\", \"What's Your Sign Design?\", and \"Cashmere Mafia\". Bobby also owned a valuable real estate portfolio including commercial centers and apartment buildings throughout the country. Bobby Zarin was the husband of real estate agent Jill Zarin, who was a one of the main housewives on Bravo's \"The Real Housewives of New York City\" for four seasons. Jill branched out from the family fabric business after getting the boot from Bravo, launching her own jewelry line and a book, \"Secrets of a Jewish Mother: Real Advice, Real Stories, Real Love\". Though she and Bobby had no children together, they each brought kids from previous marriages. Jill is the stepmother to Jonathan, David, and Jennifer Zarin, while Bobby is Allyson Shapiro's stepfather. The Zarin family lives in New York City. Unfortunately, Bobby Zarin died on January 13, 2018 at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer. He was originally diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2009. Bobby and Jill celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary just one month before his death.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-04-at-6.42.16-PM.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Kylie-Jenner.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tc.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/halle2.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/GettyImages-142432380.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/be.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/66647670_10156102536791809_1158133898392109056_n.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-300x170/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1093667182.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/GettyImages-480458848.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-300x300/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/GettyImages-480458848.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Jay-Z.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/GettyImages-488355885-e1557100267439.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/rose2.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/kimn-e1435447574683.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/2-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-138x138/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Elton-John-e1559528485715.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumbc-250x250/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Jill-Zarin.jpg"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/GettyImages-480458848.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/bobby-zarin-net-worth/", "title": "Bobby Zarin Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Bobby Zarin Net Worth and wealth: Bobby Zarin was an American real estate entrepreneur, fabric businessman, and reality TV star who had a net worth of", "cnw_share_fb_count": 47, "cnw_share_tw_count": 20, "fb": {"app_id": 241750049176605, "admins": 194602255, "pages": 135556409817901}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Bobby Zarin Net Worth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/bobby-zarin-net-worth/", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/GettyImages-480458848.jpg", "site_name": "Celebrity Net Worth", "description": "Bobby Zarin Net Worth and wealth: Bobby Zarin was an American real estate entrepreneur, fabric businessman, and reality TV star who had a net worth of"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CelebrityNetWorth", "modified_time": "2018-01-14T20:23:24+00:00", "published_time": "2010-07-05T01:14:30+00:00", "section": "Richest Celebrities", "tag": "real housewives net worth"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@celebnetworth", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/GettyImages-480458848.jpg", "title": "Bobby Zarin Net Worth", "description": "Bobby Zarin Net Worth and wealth: Bobby Zarin was an American real estate entrepreneur, fabric businessman, and reality TV star who had a net worth of"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1278292470.0, "source": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com", "summary": ""}
