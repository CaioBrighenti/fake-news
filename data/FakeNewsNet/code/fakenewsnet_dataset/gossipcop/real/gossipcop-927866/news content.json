The character is played by Ames McNamara.\n\n\u201cI thought I had to reach out to Johnny Galecki \u2019cause this is our kid together,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I texted him, what do you think we should name our baby boy? And then I said, \u2018Oh, maybe Mark,\u2019 because Mark was played by Glenn Quinn who was [Galecki\u2019s] brother on the show who passed away.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Adam Rose/ABC\n\nEarlier this year, Gilbert explained why she decided to have Mark dress up like a girl.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s based on a few kids in my life that are boys who dress in more traditionally feminine clothing,\u201d she told EW. \u201cHe\u2019s too young to be gay and he doesn\u2019t identify as transgender, but he just likes wearing that kind of clothing and that\u2019s where he is at this point in his life.\u201d\n\nThe Talk airs weekdays on CBS.", "images": ["https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/stranger-things.jpg",
