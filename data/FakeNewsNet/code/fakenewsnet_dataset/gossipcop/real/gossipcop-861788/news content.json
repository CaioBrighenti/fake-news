Kevin Federline isn't a name you hear often anymore. Federline shares two daughters with his current wife, former pro-athlete Victoria Prince, with whom he has been linked since 2008. After years of gracing the tabloids with hundreds of headlines, the full-time dad/part-time DJ/producer is happiest these days spending time with his kids, embracing his new vegan lifestyle and maintaining a healthy marriage.\n\nWe caught up with the former backup dancer just in time for Father's Day to learn how his co-parenting style has evolved, and which of his boys is already displaying his musical side!\n\nPersonal Space: What's a typical day in the Federline house?\n\nKevin Federline: Up at 6/6:30 a.m. Get the kids ready, take them to school. Kids get home, homework done, dinner, showers, off to bed. By the time they are laying down, I\u2019ll get back into the studio if I need to. I try to be in bed by midnight. If you aren't getting 5 to 6 hours of sleep, you\u2019re falling asleep while they're at school.\n\nPS: Any special plans or traditions for Father's Day?\n\nKF: I\u2019m used to not having all my kids, and this is gonna be one of those years. When you are co-parenting, you have to be willing to give up some of the things you would really like to do. My boys will be gone, their mom\u2019s off in Asia on tour. They are with me until the 15th, and then they are gone for the rest of the month. So I won\u2019t have the boys for Father\u2019s Day. I\u2019m doing a vacation with some of the kids and my nephew.\n\nPS: Is it hard raising 6 kids?\n\nKF: Having six, it feels like you're trying to control a basketball team. But it\u2019s worth it. All my kids are great; they get along. By the time you have six, you are so well seasoned. I can probably change a diaper with one hand and feed a kid at the same time.\n\nPS: Does co-parenting get easier over time?\n\nKF: Yah, you fall into your routine and it\u2019s really easy now. It wasn't always easy, but it\u2019s a lot easier now.\n\nPS: Are Preston and Jayden interested in music?\n\nKF: Oh Yah! Preston kind of knows how to DJ. He wants to learn more. I got him Ableton [music production app] on his laptop, so he kind of messes with that. He hasn't completely dived into it, and I don't want to force him. I want to make sure it\u2019s something he really wants to do. He's really big in to the EDM trap music scene. He\u2019ll come to me, \u201chave you heard this?\u201d Looking for music for me to play.\n\nPS: What do you and Victoria do for fun?\n\nKF: We do everything. She was a pro-athlete, so we love playing golf, bowling, etc. We try to keep ourselves doing regular couples\u2019 things as much as we can. She\u2019ll come to gigs when I play. Even when it\u2019s work it\u2019s still play. That\u2019s what I love about being a DJ.\n\nPS: What is the key to having a successful marriage?\n\nKF: A lot of it comes with age. You get older, and you realize what\u2019s really important to you. Definitely having patience and compromising. It has to be something you want. If it\u2019s something you don't want, it\u2019s not going to work. People expect it to be a fairytale, like a Disney cartoon, but it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s real life. It takes hard work and dedication.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/857/486/190711_3986934_Tinsley_Mortimer_Admits_This_Season_11_Momen.jpg?itok=8qj_CxiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/08/peronal-space-dorinda-medley-luann-friendship-1.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/shep-jax-brittany-wedding-gift.jpg?itok=GZKJCd9z", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/dorit-kemsley-morgan-stewart-look-alikes_0.jpg?itok=uElmmY9J", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/personal-space-kfed-brit.jpg?itok=xmtvWJN3", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-05/bravo-con-homepage_1_0.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/06/personal-space-kfed-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/legacy/images/promote/2013/11/dish-112113-andy-cohen-britney-spears.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=sLRmUfZw", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/denise-richards-eloise-chromosome-disorder.jpg?itok=xsrzukj3", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/225/655/190710_3986181_What_You_Didn_t_See_Ashley_Jacobs_Do_at_the_.jpg?itok=6y25G9ie", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/tommy-mj-mercedes-javid-parenting.jpg?itok=FAqXUSFV", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/12/personal-space-teresa-guidice-gia-college.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/briana-ryan-culberson-grocery-shopping.jpg?itok=QiQLmgVL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/1021/703/190709_3985566_Andy_Cohen_Reacts_to_Lisa_Vanderpump_s_Absen.jpg?itok=lNfk2wvQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2016/06/url-1_2.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/personal-space-amanda-batula-kyle-cook.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/bethenny-frankel-dennis-boyfriend-relationship.jpg?itok=lhAbi1mh", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/personal-space-married-5-times-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2016/08/jet-set-britney-spears-family-vacation.jpg?itok=d8PImEm-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2019-07/brandi-redmond-baby-rhod-adoption.jpg?itok=g7_Bn4aE"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/06/personal-space-kfed-promote.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marni Eth"], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/blogs/the-old-k-fed-is-dead-britney-spears-ex-kevin-federline-talks-fatherhood-and-where-the-heck", "title": "The Old K-Fed Is Dead: Britney Spears\u2019 Ex Kevin Federline Talks Fatherhood And Where The Heck He's Been", "meta_data": {"title": "The Old K-Fed Is Dead: Britney Spears\u2019 Ex Kevin Federline Talks Fatherhood And Where He's Been | Personal Space", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "Three sons, three daughters, and one very famous ex.
