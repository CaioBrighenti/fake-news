Add Interest\n\nIn 2007, Dassey was convicted as a teenager, along with his uncle Steven Avery, of murdering photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier before burning her body. He was sentenced to life in prison.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to fight to free Brendan Dassey. Brendan was a sixteen-year-old with intellectual and social disabilities when he confessed to a crime he did not commit. The video of Brendan\u2019s interrogation shows a confused boy who was manipulated by experienced police officers into accepting their story of how the murder of Teresa Halbach happened,\" Laura Nirider, an attorney for Dassey told ABC News in a statement Monday.\n\n\"These officers repeatedly assured him that everything would be \u2018okay\u2019 if he just told them what they wanted to hear and then fed him facts so that Brendan\u2019s \u2018confession\u2019 fit their theory of the crime. By the end of the interrogation, Brendan was so confused that he actually thought he was going to return to school after confessing to murder. Nonetheless, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on the basis of this \u2018confession.\u2019\"\n\nIn 2015, Dassey's story rose to the national spotlight when his interrogation was shown as part of the Netflix series, \"Making a Murderer,\" which raised questions about the case.\n\nDassey's attorneys argued that their client is borderline intellectually disabled and was coerced into a false confession. They wanted his confession thrown out and were requesting a new trial.\n\n\u201cWhen you use these tactics on someone like Brendan, who is young, inexperienced with the police, na\u00efve, compliant and suggestible, then you run the risk of getting coerced and false confessions,\" his attorney Steve Drizin said in February after asking the Supreme Court to review the case.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking him to the murder, but Dassey was convicted based on statements he gave to Wisconsin investigators.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP_brendan_dassey_jef_160812_12x5_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP_brendan_dassey_jef_160812_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP_brendan_dassey_jef_160812_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-declines-hear-appeal-making-murderer-subject/story?id=56141339", "title": "Supreme Court declines to hear appeal of 'Making a Murderer' subject", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The United State Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear the appeal of Brendan Dassey, whose murder conviction was the subject of the Netflix series", "keywords": "Supreme Court of the United States, sentencing, Brendan Dassey, prison, Netflix, murderer, teenagers, legal trial,politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Supreme Court declines to hear appeal of 'Making a Murderer' subject", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "Supreme Court declines to hear appeal of 'Making a Murderer' subject", "description": "The United State Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear the appeal of Brendan Dassey, whose murder conviction was the subject of the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-declines-hear-appeal-making-murderer-subject/story?id=56141339", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP_brendan_dassey_jef_160812_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "Supreme Court of the United States, sentencing, Brendan Dassey, prison, Netflix, murderer, teenagers, legal trial", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "Supreme Court declines to hear appeal of 'Making a Murderer' subject", "description": "The United State Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear the appeal of Brendan Dassey, whose murder conviction was the subject of the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer.\"", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-declines-hear-appeal-making-murderer-subject/story?id=56141339", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP_brendan_dassey_jef_160812_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,56141339", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,56141339", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-declines-hear-appeal-making-murderer-subject/story?id=56141339"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,56141339", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,56141339", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-declines-hear-appeal-making-murderer-subject/story?id=56141339", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-declines-hear-appeal-making-murderer-subject/story?id=56141339"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
