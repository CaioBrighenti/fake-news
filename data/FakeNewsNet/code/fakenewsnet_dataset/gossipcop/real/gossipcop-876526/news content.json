So if you'll bear with us, this is a new song and we'll never play this again.\"\n\nMartin explained that the band would play the acoustic song one time for fans in Miami and that they wanted to \"send it over there to everyone who missed the show,\" with lyrics that pray for Texans to make it through the rain so the band can come back down to see them again soon. As spotted by HuffPo, the song features the lyrics, \"I'm dreamin' of when I get back to Houston/ I'm dreamin' of that fair and special place/ I'm dreamin' of when Houston has no problems/ In that city where they send you into space/ I'm dreamin' of when I get back to Texas/ Corpus Christie, Harris County, Galveston... Houston you got to keep on keepin' on.\"\n\nListen to it below and look for a list of ways you can help the victims of Hurricane Harvey.\n\nArtists including Chris Young, Lady Antebellum, Beyonc\u00e9, Kevin Hart and Drake have pledged to help those affected by the massive storm, which has dumped more than 40 inches of rain in some parts of Texas to date.\n\nThe Red Cross has posted a list of flood safety tips here.
