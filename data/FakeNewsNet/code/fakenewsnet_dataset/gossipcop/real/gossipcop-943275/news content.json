Oh, haaayyy @nicosantos.\u201d\n\nSantos, meanwhile, was all jokes on the social media site \u2014 writing to a news outlet reporting on their relationship, \u201cStop spreading lies! I am NOT, I repeat, NOT\u202625!\u201c\n\nPhotos of Smith and Santos first surfaced online in April when the two attend the 29th Annual GLAAD Media Awards\u2019 Hyundai afterparty at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nImage zoom Nico Santos and Zeke Smith Vivien Killilea/Getty\n\nWhile in the Big Apple in May, the two saw the acclaimed Broadway musical SpongeBob SquarePants \u2014 Santos sharing a photo of the two holding hands at the Palace Theater. \u201cHere with this handsome fella,\u201d he wrote.\n\nVacations in Palm Springs and a road trip to the Cabazon Dinosaurs in Riverside, California, followed in the weeks to come.\n\nMost recently, the two were at Sunday\u2019s gay pride festivities in Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019re here! We\u2019re queer! We\u2019re brunching!\u201d Santos captioned an Instagram photo afterwards. \u201cGetting some after parade nomnoms with my love. Happy Pride Los Angeles!\u201d\n\nSmith first made headlines back in May 2017, when he was outed as transgender by a fellow contestant during Survivor\u2018s all-star Second Chances season 34.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be the \u2018first transgender Survivor contestant,\u2019 \u201d Smith told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of being trans, but I didn\u2019t want that to be my story. I just wanted to go out on an adventure and play a great game. I just wanted to be known for my game.\u201d\n\nSurvivor had helped the Oklahoma-raised reality star through his transition, which happened while he was studying religion at Harvard. \u201cMy confidence was obliterated, and I was afraid to dream,\u201d Smith said of being depressed during and after his transition. \u201cI realized I needed to take on a big challenge to become the man I wanted to be. For some reason, that was Survivor.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Zeke Smith Monty Brinton/CBS via Getty\n\nFans reacted to the news with positivity and support, which left Smith \u201ca bit overwhelmed and humbled.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never in a million years thought the response would be as positive as it was,\u201d he told PEOPLE last May. \u201cI worried about sensationalist headlines and photos being drudged up from my past. I was prepared to be re-victimized. But the response I received \u2013 the outpouring of love from the public \u2013 was something I never imagined happening. I was really touched.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Outed as Transgender on Reality TV: Survivor\u2018s Zeke Smith\n\nSantos, meanwhile, gained fame by playing the scene-stealing sales associate Mateo Liwanag in Superstore.
