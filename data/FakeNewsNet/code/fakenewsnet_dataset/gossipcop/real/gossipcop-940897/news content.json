Aside from their adorbs PDA, the pair have also taken their rekindled romance over to Instagram (kinda).\n\nHit play on the video to see the celebs who got back with their ex...\n\nBella and The Weeknd (AKA Abel Tesfaye) looked more in love than ever as they strolled the streets in matching black ensembles after grabbing lunch together at a local cafe.\n\n@backgriduk\n\nWhile the snap is all we need to know that Abella 2.0 is officially a go, there have been a few subtle appearances over on the 'gram that have totally solidified the evidence.\n\nThe Weeknd took to his story to post a snap of a sugar sachet with the words 'Sugar Daddy', but the fresh nails in the picture definitely don't belong to him.\n\nInstagram/TheWeeknd\n\nIn fact, we're pretty sure they belong to Bella since she posted a pic of herself donning the precise same flawless nails.\n\nFurthermore, the pair can be linked via a jar of pasta sauce (hear us out!).\n\nBella Hadid posted a couple of pics to Insta, the first of her posing with some roses and the second with a giant jar of pasta sauce balancing on her head.\n\nThen Abel took to Instagram to post a snap of his finished plate, but over in the corner is the precise same jar of pasta sauce (yep, just call us Sherlock)\n\nDate night! We're going to go ahead and assume that the roses and the sauce were a cute gift for Bella, and we're seriously respecting his choice. Roses are great and all, but can you think of a better/more practical pressie than a family size jar of Pomodoro?\n\nInstagram/TheWeeknd\n\nSeriously though, it looks like the pair are having the best Paris rendezvous, and we're so happy to see them giving it another shot.\n\nWe could just feel it coming!", "images": ["http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/vimn_image_embed/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/06/04/bellaandtheweeknd.jpg?itok=V6siPd6u", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/image-w-200-h-200-scale-crop/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/02/16/screen_shot_2018-02-16_at_13.30.51.png?itok=FlQ8ziUR", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/04/16/weekndbella.jpg?itok=sHJkbiPG", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/vimn_image_embed/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/06/04/theweekndhtis.jpg?itok=R7M1QxL3", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/all/themes/vimn/common/images/logos/mtv.svg", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/vimn_image_embed/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/06/04/theweekndthisone.jpg?itok=ToFThW8O", "data:image/gif;base64,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"], "top_img": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/04/16/weekndbella.jpg?itok=sHJkbiPG", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/bella-hadid/news/bella-hadid-and-the-weeknd-cosy-up-in-paris-as-they-go-insta-official", "title": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Pictured Arm-In-Arm In Paris As They Go Insta Official", "meta_data": {"og": {"url": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/bella-hadid/news/bella-hadid-and-the-weeknd-cosy-up-in-paris-as-they-go-insta-official", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/04/16/weekndbella.jpg?itok=sHJkbiPG", "description": "Well, they kind of went Insta official.", "title": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Pictured Arm-In-Arm In Paris As They Go Insta Official | MTV UK"}, "twitter": {"title": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Pictured Arm-In-Arm In Paris As They Go Insta Official | MTV UK", "description": "Well, they kind of went Insta official.", "url": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/bella-hadid/news/bella-hadid-and-the-weeknd-cosy-up-in-paris-as-they-go-insta-official", "image": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/04/16/weekndbella.jpg?itok=sHJkbiPG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow,NOODP", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "vimn": {"entity_type": "node", "entity_uuid": "25ff0451-a9b1-4823-b80d-12d32cf8d9d9"}, "thumbnail": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/media_thumbnail/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2018/04/16/weekndbella.jpg?itok=LtRBSQ6v", "description": "Well, they kind of went Insta official.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.co.uk", "summary": ""}
