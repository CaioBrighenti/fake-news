At times, Norah O\u2019Donnell seemed on the verge of tearing up.\n\nNevertheless, the \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d anchors were there, seated at the glass table where they had hosted the show almost every weekday morning for the past five years.\n\nA chair for Charlie Rose, their third co-host, was missing.\n\nRose, of course, was absent from Tuesday\u2019s edition of the show he had been a part of since its inception: CBS News suspended him shortly after The Washington Post published an extensive report detailing alleged unwanted sexual advances toward women by the 75-year-old broadcaster. The network announced his firing Tuesday afternoon, and PBS and Bloomberg soon followed suit.\n\nOn the morning after the newsman became the newsmaker, the sexual harassment allegations against Rose were the top story on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to begin with news affecting all of us,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said matter-of-factly at the top of the program.\n\n\u201cThis one does hit close to home,\u201d correspondent Bianna Golodryga said in introducing a story about the allegations.\n\nThe \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d package recapped The Post\u2019s reporting: Eight women, who were either employees or prospective employees of Rose\u2019s, told The Post that he made unwanted sexual advances toward them between the late 1990s and 2011.\n\nThose advances included lewd phone calls, walking around naked in their presence, or groping their breasts, buttocks or genital areas, the women said. CBS said that it had spoken to one of Rose\u2019s accusers and that she declined to go on camera but confirmed the accuracy of the report.\n\n\u201cAs tough as this story is, it\u2019s important that we cover it,\u201d Golodryga said.\n\n[Eight women say Charlie Rose sexually harassed them \u2014 with nudity, groping and lewd calls]\n\nAnd then, in a remarkable segment, Rose\u2019s broadcast partners slipped out of their newswoman roles and spoke as . . . people, full of anger and bewilderment and betrayal.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment that demands a frank and honest assessment about where we stand and more generally the safety of women,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cLet me be very clear: There is no excuse for this alleged behavior. It is systematic and pervasive.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis has to end. This behavior is wrong. Period.\u201d\n\nSaid King: \u201cI really am reeling. I got one hour and 42 minutes of sleep last night. Both my son and my daughter called me; Oprah called me and said, \u2018Are you okay?\u2019 I am not okay.\u201d\n\nThe Post article, she said, \u201cwas deeply disturbing, troubling and painful for me to read.\u201d\n\nKing noted that she and Rose \u201cenjoyed a friendship and partnership.\u201d\n\nNow, she said: \u201cI\u2019m really struggling. . . . What do you say, when someone that you deeply care about has done something that\u2019s so horrible? How do you wrap your brain around that?\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI am deeply rocked by this.\u201d\n\nRose, King said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t get a pass, because I can\u2019t stop thinking about the anguish of these women . . . that and the pain that they\u2019re going through.\u201d\n\nKing noted that she hadn\u2019t yet spoken to Rose but that she intended to call him at some point on Tuesday.\n\nO\u2019Donnell said she hadn\u2019t spoken with him, either.\n\n[John Oliver has been pointing out the \u2018awkward sex talk\u2019 on Charlie Rose\u2019s CBS show for years]\n\nRose had co-hosted \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d since the show\u2019s launch in 2012 and was a contributing correspondent for the network\u2019s Sunday night show, \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nHis suspension was announced less than 90 minutes after The Post\u2019s story published. The suspension was acknowledged Monday on \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d where interim anchor Anthony Mason said \u201cthe wave of sexual abuse allegations we\u2019ve been reporting from Hollywood to Washington have now touched CBS News.\u201d\n\nRose was fired on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cDespite Charlie\u2019s important journalistic contribution to our news division, there is absolutely nothing more important, in this or any organization, than ensuring a safe, professional workplace \u2014 a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work,\u201d CBS News President David Rhodes wrote in a staff memo. \u201cWe need to be such a place.\u201d\n\nRose was one of the best-regarded names in TV news. His 2013 interview with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad won him both an Emmy and a Peabody Award, and in 2015 he received the Walter Cronkite Excellence in Journalism Award.\n\nFollowing The Post\u2019s report, PBS and Bloomberg said they were suspending distribution of Rose\u2019s namesake interview program, which is produced by Charlie Rose Inc., an independent television production company. On Tuesday afternoon, PBS, which had aired \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d since its 1991 debut, said it had \u201cterminated its relationship\u201d with Rose.\n\n\u201cPBS expects all the producers we work with to provide a workplace where people feel safe and are treated with dignity and respect,\u201d the network said in a statement. Less than 30 minutes later, Bloomberg said it had ended its rebroadcast agreement for \u201cCharlie Rose.\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided to The Post on Monday \u2014 and later posted on social media \u2014 Rose said: \u201cI deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed. I have behaved insensitively at times, and I accept responsibility for that, though I do not believe that all of these allegations are accurate. I always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nMore reading:\n\nThe sexual-harassment epidemic has been diagnosed.
