# Fake News Detection

This project is a summer research project focused on creating an interpretable model for fake news detection. While work in this field typically involves deep neural networks, this project aims to use simpler models in order to reach novel conclusions about fake news. The objective is not to beat the state-of-the-art approach, but to learn more about the textual properties of fake news.
