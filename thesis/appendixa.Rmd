## Variable Description

This section briefly lists and describes each variable available in the dataset of text features for real and fake articles. Each variable is a metric quantifying the semantic properties of the text body.

### Complexity Metrics

These features are intended to capture the complexity of the text. Some of these are direct textual complexity metrics calculated using the ```quanteda``` [@quanteda] package in R. Others describe the mean, standard deviation, and interquatile range of text parse tree depths calculated using the Stanford Core NLP [@CoreNLP] toolset, which constructs consituency trees for each sentence in the text body. There are other miscelleanouscomplexity metrics described below.

* ```mu_sentence``` - Mean number of sentences

### Named Entity Recognition

This includes only a single variable: the number of named entities in the text, counted by the Stanford CoreNLP [@CoreNLP] Named Entity Recognition tool.

* ```NER``` - Number of named entities

## Outlier Removal

The dataset of labels (true/fake), article title, and article text body were gathered using the JSON scraper included by the authors of the FakeNewsNet dataset [@FNN]. However, given that web pages often change structure, move to a different address, or are removed from the internet entirely, many of the entries have changed since the dataset was initially compiled, and are now unavailable or in an incorrect format. These articles must be removed from the dataset.

To identify these outliers, I fit a baseline logistic regression model and identified overly influential observations with Cook's Distance 4 times larger than the mean. I then manually inspected each of the 575 potential outliers and labeled true outliers, such as pages who's text is simply "404 Error: Page not found," or articles that are actually just lists. Out of the 575 potential outliers, I found 422 to be true outliers.

For further error removal, I intend to use a similar process to manually isolate articles including the text "error," and either too long or too short, and identify whether these are indeed outliers.

## Group Differences

This section includes preliminary data exploration demonstrating differences in each variable accross the two labels. First, I incude tables with significance levels of a Mood's Median hypothesis test calculated using the RVAideMemoire package [@RVAideMemoire]. Next, I include plots showing 95% confidence intervals of medians for each variable by group calculated using bootstrapping.

### Mood's Median Test

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide', message='hide'}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)

pval_table <- readRDS("C:/Users/Caio Laptop/Documents/Repositories/fake-news/thesis/pval_table.RDS") %>%
  rename(Variable = var, `p-value` = pval, `Median - Fake` = Fake, `Median - Real` = Real)
